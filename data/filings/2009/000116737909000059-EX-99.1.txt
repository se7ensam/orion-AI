      HUENENBERG, Switzerland – April 22,
2009 – Alcon, Inc. (NYSE:ACL) reported global sales of $1,493.3 million
for the first quarter of 2009, a 4.8 percent increase excluding the impact of
foreign exchange fluctuations, or a decrease of 2.8 percent compared to the
first quarter of 2008 on a reported basis. Net earnings for the first quarter of
2009 increased 5.3 percent to $452.0 million compared to $429.4 million in the
first quarter of 2008.  For the same periods, diluted earnings per
share increased 5.6 percent to $1.51 from $1.43.  Excluding $13.1
million of after-tax costs associated with the company’s previously announced
restructuring program, both non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for the first quarter
of 2009 increased 8.3 percent to $465.1, and diluted earnings per share
increased 8.4 percent to $1.55 when compared to the first quarter of
2008.  Reconciliations of reported and adjusted results for the first
quarter are included in the financial tables below.
          “Our global
diversification and commercial execution delivered organic sales growth in line
with our expectations and solid profit performance in spite of a challenging
global market environment,” said Kevin Buehler, Alcon’s president and chief
executive officer. “We will continue to manage discretionary costs in line with
the current market conditions while still investing in brand development and
research projects that will fuel future growth.”
      
      First Quarter
Highlights
      All
growth comparisons are for the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first
quarter of 2008.  Organic sales growth rates provided below are
non-GAAP measures, which are reconciled in a table at the end of this

                International
      sales achieved positive organic sales growth of 10.2 percent, but declined
      3.4 percent on a reported basis.  Strong international
      pharmaceutical sales, especially in Japan, and a 14.1 percent organic
      sales growth rate, or a decline of 5.0 percent on a reported basis, for
      emerging markets were the main contributors to this
      performance.

                U.S.
      sales declined 2.1 percent due to generic competition to TOBRADEX®
      ophthalmic solution, lower market demand for ophthalmic
      pharmaceuticals, a less favorable market environment in cataract surgery
      and a reduction in retailer inventories in the consumer
      business.

                Sales
      in Japan increased 18.3 percent organically, or 33.1 percent on a reported
      basis, due to a stronger Japanese allergy season and significant market
      share gains by Patanol®
      ophthalmic solution.  TRAVATANZ®
      ophthalmic solution also gained market share and contributed to this
      strong performance.

      solutions.  On a combined basis in the United

                Sales
      of TobraDex®
      ophthalmic suspension declined 39.7 percent due to the U.S. launch of
      generic tobramycin/dexamethasone suspensions in January.  This
      decline was partially offset by a pipeline fill for and sales of generic
      tobramycin/dexamethasone by the company’s generic affiliate, Falcon
      Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.

                Sales
      of intraocular lenses were $248.3 million, which reflected a 4.4 percent
      organic increase, or a 4.8 decrease on a reported basis. AcrySof® Toric and AcrySof® ReSTOR® Aspheric advanced
      technology lenses together rose 9.7 percent organically, or 0.8
      percent on a reported growth basis. Advanced technology lenses
      increased 6.3 percent on a unit basis reflecting continued market adoption
      of these innovative
technologies.

                A
      decline in retailer inventories of contact lens solutions in the United
      States had a negative impact on sales of contact lens
      disinfectants.  However, OPTI-FREE® RepleniSH® and EXPRESS® multipurpose
      disinfecting solutions maintained their position as the leading branded
      solutions on the market today.

      March 10, the company announced a refractive laser contract with
      LCA-Vision for 75 ALLEGRETTO WAVE® excimer
      lasers.  The contract comes as part of a decision by LCA-Vision
      to standardize its laser surgery technology on two platforms based on
      clinical performance.

      European Union approved diopter expansions for the AcrySof® ReSTOR® +3.0 and +4.0 Add lenses to
      now include 6.0 to 9.5 diopters, which further broadens the existing reach
      of these lenses.  The company filed a PMA in the United States
      for similar diopter expansions for the AcrySof® ReSTOR® +4.0 Add
      lens.

                Alcon’s
      generic affiliate, Falcon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., filed an ANDA for
      generic latanoprost, which is a generic version of the leading
      prostaglandin analogue on the
market.

                Gross
      profit margin increased 210 basis points to 76.2 percent of sales, due to
      differences in the impact of exchange rates on cost of goods sold between
      the two periods, favorable product mix and manufacturing
      efficiencies.

                The
      company’s cost management programs and a positive impact from foreign
      currency resulted in a decline of 2.5 percent in selling general and
      administrative costs, which include costs of $9.4 million related to the
      restructuring.
              
            
        
      
       
      
      Full
Year Outlook
          Based on the
positive sales results for the first quarter of 2009, the company reaffirmed
that it expects to achieve its previously-issued, mid-single digit organic sales
growth target for 2009, which excludes currency fluctuations and
acquisitions.  The company also reconfirmed that 2009 diluted earnings
per share on a U.S. GAAP basis are expected to be between $6.00 and $6.20 and
between $6.05 and $6.25 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis (excluding restructuring
charges).  The company said its underlying performance and market
fundamentals support the achievement of full year guidance, with the recognition
that there will be some periodic variability in performance and such patterns
have been incorporated into expectations for the full year.

      Note:
Organic change calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations and acquisitions. Management believes organic sales change is an
important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with
a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit
volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a
non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior year amounts to conform with current year
presentation.

      Note:
Organic change presents sales growth without the impact of foreign
exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Management believes organic sales
change is an important measure of the company’s operations because it
provides investors with a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due
to changes in unit volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is
considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Adjusted net earnings and diluted EPS measure the results of the company's
operations without certain items that pertained only to the period presented.
Management believes these measures are an important measure of the company’s
operations because it provides investors with a clearer picture of the core
operations of the company.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.
