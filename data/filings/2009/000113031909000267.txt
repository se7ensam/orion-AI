NEWS RELEASE TRANSMITTED BY MARKETWIRE

FOR: AGRIUM INC.

TSX, NYSE SYMBOL: AGU

May 6, 2009

Agrium Reports First Quarter Results, Provides Guidance for the Second Quarter

CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - May 6, 2009) -

ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$

Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today a net loss for the first
quarter of $60-million ($0.38 diluted loss per share), compared with the net
earnings of $195-million in the first quarter of 2008 ($1.23 diluted earnings
per share). The first quarter results include non-qualifying natural gas and
power hedge losses of $69-million ($0.30 diluted loss per share) and a
$10-million ($0.04 diluted loss per share) expense in stock-based compensation
in the quarter. The results also include an inventory write-down of $18-million
($0.08 diluted loss per share) associated with our Wholesale purchase for resale
business. Excluding these items our net earnings would have been $7-million
($0.04 diluted earnings per share).

"Spring applications have now commenced in all of our North American markets and
the outlook for our business is strong. The first quarter is traditionally our
weakest quarter, as we build inventories in preparation for the spring season.
This year's results were also impacted by the drop in potash demand, a
short-term squeeze on retail nutrient margins and the late spring. The decrease
in potash volumes versus 2008 and the costs associated with production
curtailments resulted in reduction in gross profit of approximately
$180-million. We anticipate demand for potash to recover in the second half of
2009."(1) said Mike Wilson, Agrium President and CEO.

"Retail crop nutrient margins were impacted by the significant decline in
nitrogen and phosphate prices in the fourth quarter of 2008, but we expect our
margins will recover as we move through the spring season. The strength of our
crop protection and seed sales will continue to be evident this year, and
despite lower than average crop nutrient margins in the first half of 2009 we
expect EBITDA from our Retail business to be close to one-half billion dollars
in 2009."(1)

With respect to Agrium's proposal to acquire CF Industries Holdings, Inc.
("CF"), Mr. Wilson stated "We remain fully committed to acquiring CF and will
continue to seek discussions with CF for a mutually beneficial transaction that
delivers additional value for our respective shareholders. We have repeatedly
advised CF and its shareholders that we would be prepared to increase our offer
further if CF can demonstrate additional value."

(1) See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".


Agrium is providing guidance for the second quarter of 2009 of $1.70 to $2.10
diluted earnings per share, or $2.00 to $2.40 diluted earnings per share
excluding estimated hedging losses and stock based compensation expense.(1)

KEY RESULTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

- - Wholesale per tonne margins for all three nutrients were strong, with margins
for our phosphate and urea well above $100 per tonne and potash at $276 per
tonne. However, crop nutrient demand in North America and globally is expected
to be significantly lower in 2008/09 fertilizer year than the previous year. We
expect North American demand for the 2008/09 fertilizer year to be about 10
percent lower for nitrogen (spring over spring demand to be flat to slightly
higher), phosphate 25-35 percent lower (spring over spring down about 5-15
percent) and potash 30-40 percent lower (spring over spring down about 10-20
percent).

- - Retail margins in the first half of 2009 will be impacted by the high retail
inventories following the fall season combined with the unprecedented decline in
nitrogen and phosphate prices in the fourth quarter of 2008. Despite these
conditions, we expect to largely sell out of our current crop nutrient inventory
positions by the end of the spring season and do not anticipate any inventory
write-down in our Retail business.(1)

- - The completion of the share swap for the MOPCO Egyptian nitrogen facility at
the end of January, 2009 contributed $4-million in equity earnings to Agrium's
results this quarter.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

May 6, 2009

The following interim management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") updates our
annual MD&A included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, to which our
readers are referred. No update is provided where an item is not material or
there has been no material change from the discussion in our annual MD&A.
Forward-Looking Statements are outlined after the Outlook, Key Risks and
Uncertainties section of this press release. The major assumptions made in
preparing our first half guidance are outlined below and include, but are not
limited to:

- - Crop and fertilizer prices through the second quarter of 2009 approximating
current prices;

- - Retail fertilizer sales volumes and gross margin percentages significantly
below 2008 second quarter levels;

- - Wholesale nitrogen and phosphate sales volumes for the second quarter
consistent with levels in the same quarter of 2008;

- - Wholesale potash sales volumes significantly below second quarter 2008 levels;

- - Wholesale purchase for resale sales volumes approximately double second
quarter of 2008 levels due to the impact of acquisitions;

<PAGE>

- - Wholesale production volumes below levels in the same quarter of 2008 with
potash and phosphate production operating significantly below capacity due to
market driven outages and turnarounds;

(1) See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

- - Average NYMEX gas price for the second quarter not deviating significantly
from $4.40/MMBtu;

- - The exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, expressed in U.S. dollars,
averaging C$1.28 to U.S.$1.00;

- - The guidance does not reflect the potential completion of a CF deal in the
second quarter of 2009;

- - Urea sales prices to Argentine growers approximating import prices rather than
a government capped price;

- - Stock based compensation expense reflecting Agrium's stock price at the close
of business on May 4, 2009 (U.S.$46.96) and a $1 change in stock price equating
to approximately a $0.01 change in earnings per share; and,

- - The exclusion of mark-to-market gains or losses on non-qualifying commodity
hedge positions settling in future periods.

2009 First Quarter Operating Results

NET EARNINGS

Agrium's first quarter consolidated net loss was $60-million, or $0.38 diluted
loss per share, compared to net earnings of $195-million, or $1.23 diluted
earnings per share, for the same quarter of 2008. Net earnings before interest
expense and income taxes ("EBIT") was a loss of $56-million for the first
quarter of 2009 compared with EBIT of $305-million for the first quarter of
2008. The decrease in EBIT was primarily due to lower gross profit from reduced
potash sales volumes and lower selling prices for most products, as well as
certain items noted below. A reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings is provided
in the section "Non-GAAP Measures".

Consolidated gross profit in the first quarter of 2009 was $273-million compared
to $392-million in the first quarter of 2008. Contributions from the UAP
business, partially offset by higher cost of inventory purchased when fertilizer
prices were higher, resulted in a $27-million increase in gross profit in our
Retail business unit. Wholesale gross profit decreased by $156-million primarily
due to the large decline in potash sales volumes, lower prices for nitrogen,
phosphate and product purchased for resale. Quarter-over-quarter gross profit
for Advanced Technologies decreased $7-million due largely to volume decline in
turf and ornamental products.

Expenses have increased $242-million quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting
a combination of the following items:

- - $99-million increase in Retail's selling expense resulting in selling expense
of $198-million primarily due to the UAP business; and

<PAGE>

- - $136-million increase in loss on derivative contracts primarily related to gas
and power, resulting in $69-million hedging loss.

The effective tax rate was 31 percent for the first quarter of 2009, compared to
33 percent for the same quarter of 2008.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PEFORMANCE

Retail

Retail results are not directly comparable to the same period last year due to
the inclusion of UAP, which was acquired in May of 2008. Retail's 2009 first
quarter net sales were just over $1-billion, which was more than double the
$394-million in the first quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $142-million in the
first quarter of 2009, compared to $115-million for the same period last year.
While gross profit was $27-million higher than last year, EBIT was significantly
lower due to the higher selling and general and administrative costs associated
with the addition of the UAP business. Retail EBIT was a loss of $94-million in
the first quarter of 2009, versus a positive EBIT of $4-million in the first
quarter of 2008 and a loss of $21-million in the first quarter of 2007.

Crop nutrients net sales reached $437-million this quarter, an increase of
$188-million compared to the first quarter of 2008, due to the addition of UAP
business and higher average selling prices. Gross profit was $18-million this
quarter compared to $72-million in the first quarter of 2008. The decrease was
primarily due to lower margins resulting from the carryover of higher priced
crop nutrient inventories from the fall of 2008, which have been sold into a
lower price environment this spring. This resulted in crop nutrient margins
declining to an unprecedented 4 percent in the first quarter of 2009, compared
to 29 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Over the past 10 years, retail crop
nutrient margins in the first quarter have averaged 23 percent and the previous
lowest year was in 2006 at 21 percent. Crop nutrient margins continue to rise in
the second quarter of 2009 and are expected to reach normal levels once the
majority of the higher priced nutrient inventory position is sold, which is
anticipated by the end of the spring season.(1) Nutrient sales volumes in the
first quarter were also impacted by the late start to the spring season and what
is expected to be lower demand for potash and phosphate through the spring
compared to the same period last year. Sales volumes and margins at our South
American operations were also significantly lower this quarter than the same
period last year due to extremely dry conditions and the added challenge of
uncertainty over government policies.

Crop protection net sales increased to $426-million this quarter, compared to
$93-million in the first quarter of 2008. Our gross profit this quarter reached
$77-million, more than double last year's $29-million. The strength of earnings
from this product line illustrates the benefits of the diversity in our Retail
business. Most of the increase in sales and gross profits was due to the
addition of UAP's significant crop protection business, including a broad range
of private label products. Crop protection product margins as a percentage of
net sales were 18 percent for the first quarter of 2009 versus 31 percent for
the first quarter of 2008. The lower margin was primarily due to the inclusion
of UAP's substantial wholesale crop protection business, which has a
significantly lower percentage margin than the retail portion of the business.
Last year's figure also benefited from inventory appreciation for glyphosate
products which is not expected to occur in 2009.

<PAGE>

(1) See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

Net sales for seed, services and other increased to $188-million this quarter
from $52-million in the first quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $47-million in
the first quarter of 2009, compared to $14-million for the same period last year
and slightly ahead of last year after accounting for the addition of UAP's
business.

Retail selling expenses for the first quarter of 2009 were $198-million, double
last year's level, due to the inclusion of UAP's business and in line with our
expectations. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter
of 2009 was 19 percent compared to 25 percent for the same period last year.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were $695-million for the first quarter of 2009 compared
to $708-million for the first quarter of 2008. Lower sales volumes and prices
for nitrogen and phosphate and substantially lower potash sales volumes, were
largely offset by higher potash selling prices and increased product purchased
for resale sales volumes reflecting the CMF acquisition. The decrease in sales
volumes in the first quarter of 2009 was a result of a cautious approach to
replenishing stocks by retailers and distributors, lower grower demand for
potash and phosphate, and weather delays impacting the start of the spring
season in some markets.

Gross profit was $117-million in the first quarter of 2009, a $156-million
reduction from the $273-million recorded for the same period last year. EBIT of
$57-million in the first quarter of 2009 was also lower than the $313-million
for the same period last year due primarily to lower sales volumes for all three
nutrients, and in particular for potash, lower sales prices for nitrogen and
phosphate and higher cost of potash as a result of production curtailments.

Gross profit for nitrogen was $55-million this quarter, compared to $126-million
in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen prices were lower than the same period
last year across all products for both benchmark and Agrium's realized prices.
Sales volumes were 12 percent lower than the same period last year, due to lower
sales from Profertil and lower UAN sales volumes. Cost of product was $258 per
tonne this quarter, slightly lower than last year, as lower North American gas
prices were largely offset by higher costs associated with market related plant
shutdowns or reduced operating rates at a number of our facilities in 2009. The
continued decline in North American gas costs through the first quarter of 2009
was not fully reflected in our average cost of product this quarter due to
higher cost of product drawn from opening inventory. Agrium's nitrogen margins
averaged $82 per tonne this quarter, compared with $164 per tonne in the first
quarter of last year. Urea margins remained well over $100 per tonne, while
ammonia and UAN margins were challenged due to the lower operating rate for
these two product groups and the much higher proportion of ammonia sales that go
to the lower margin industrial business in the first quarter.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $5.64/MMBtu in the first quarter of 2009
versus $6.42/MMBtu in the first quarter of 2008. The U.S. benchmark (NYMEX)
natural gas price for the first quarter of 2009 was $4.86/MMBtu,

<PAGE>

versus $8.07/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $6.82/MMBtu in the fourth
quarter of 2008. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential narrowed to $0.32/MMBtu
for the first quarter of 2009. Agrium's average gas cost was higher than NYMEX
this quarter due to realized losses on gas purchase contracts. We anticipate a
significant decline in our overall gas cost in the second quarter of 2009.(1)

Phosphate gross profit was $26-million, compared to $44-million for the same
quarter last year. Realized sales price of $559 per tonne was slightly less than
$612 achieved in the same quarter last year. Sales volumes were 13 percent lower
than the same quarter last year, but were significantly higher than the fourth
quarter of 2008. Phosphate cost of product was $430 per tonne, a $59 per tonne
decrease over the previous quarter and an increase of $8 per tonne compared to
the same period last year. The over 10 percent decrease in cost versus the
previous quarter was due primarily to lower ammonia and sulphur costs and the
lower value of the Canadian dollar. Gross margin for phosphate was $129 per
tonne compared with $190 per tonne in the first quarter of 2008.

Gross profit for potash was $21-million versus $87-million in the first quarter
of 2008. Realized selling prices were almost double last year's levels, however
this was not enough to offset the impact of a significant decrease in sales
volumes and higher per unit costs. Sales volumes decreased by 373,000 tonnes
compared to the same period last year. International and domestic demand
declined as a result of delivery contract expirations in China, credit issues in
many other international markets and an increasingly cautious approach to
replenishing stocks by retailers and distributors in North America and globally.
Cost of product increased substantially from the fourth quarter of 2008 because
of lower production volumes resulting in a larger proportion of fixed costs
being allocated to fewer sales tonnes. Gross margin on a per tonne basis was
$276 per tonne, which was well above the $194 per tonne in the first quarter of
last year.

Net sales for product purchased for resale were more than five times that of
last year's levels, largely due to the addition of the European CMF business.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2009 was $2-million, or $4-million lower
than the same period last year. The reduction was due to an $18-million
inventory write-down this quarter as a result of net realizable value
adjustments to our purchased product inventories.

Wholesale expenses were significantly higher than last year as a result of
unrealized net mark-to-market losses of $31-million from natural gas and power
derivatives and realized losses of $33-million on natural gas and power
derivatives, compared to unrealized gains of $63-million and realized gains of
$4-million on these derivatives the previous year. This was partially offset by
a decrease in potash profit and capital taxes of $40-million due mainly to lower
potash sales volumes.

(1)See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' first quarter 2009 net sales were $67-million compared to
$79-million in the first quarter of 2008. Net sales and gross profit were
impacted by reduced volumes and margins in the turf and ornamental segment.

<PAGE>

This was due to lower household expenditures given the economic downturn, and
some customers deferring purchases of controlled-release products across a
variety of end-markets. However, our ESN net sales increased due to a 38 percent
increase in ESN sales volumes this quarter, which more than offset lower ESN
prices, due to the 26 percent decline in benchmark urea prices. Gross profit for
Advanced Technologies was $10-million for the quarter, compared with $17-million
for the same period last year, while EBITDA was $6-million, a decrease of
$4-million versus the comparable period in 2008. The reduction in profit and
earnings was due to weaker demand and margins from a number of our
controlled-release products other than ESN, due to lower housing starts and a
depressed economy. In the first quarter, ESN accounted for 33 percent of
Advanced Technologies' gross profit, more than double the same period last year.

In April, Agrium issued a notice exercising its option to acquire 50 percent of
the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of Hanfeng Slow Release
Fertilizer (Canada) Co. Ltd. ("Subco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hanfeng
Evergreen Inc. Subco owns a 50 percent interest through a joint venture
arrangement in a sulfur coated urea (SCU) production facility in China with
annual production of 50,000 tonnes. Agrium's total investment in the project is
anticipated to be approximately $3-million.

Other

EBIT for our Other non-operating business unit for the first quarter of 2009 was
a loss of $20-million, relatively unchanged compared to a loss of $18-million
for the first quarter of 2008.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities was $68-million in the first quarter of
2009, a decrease of $322-million from $390-million in the same period of 2008.
Driving this change was a decrease of $255-million in net earnings and a
$223-million increase in non-cash working capital, partially offset by
unrealized loss on gas and power derivative contracts and unrealized foreign
exchange loss from the revaluation of Canadian denominated payables in U.S.
companies and U.S. denominated receivables in Canadian companies.

Cash used in investing activities decreased by $2-million in the first quarter
of 2009 due to lower capital expenditures offset by the $65-million purchase of
CF shares (discussed further under the section "Business Acquisition") in the
first quarter of 2009.

Cash used in financing activities was $201-million in the first quarter of 2009
compared with cash provided by financing activities of $3-million in the same
period in 2008. The change was due to a higher pay-down of our bank

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently,
quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. Sales are concentrated
in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are
accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally occur after the
planting seasons in North and South America.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 25, 2009, Agrium submitted a proposal to the board of directors of
CF to acquire all of the capital stock of CF for cash and Agrium shares at
$72.00 per CF share, or a total of approximately $3.6-billion, based on the
closing price of Agrium shares on February 24, 2009. Agrium would fund the cash
portion through available liquidity and committed financing. The board of
directors of CF rejected Agrium's proposal on March 9, 2009.

On March 16, 2009, Agrium commenced an exchange offer for all of the outstanding
shares of CF (the "Offer"), pursuant to which CF stockholders would receive
$31.70 in cash plus one common share of Agrium for each CF share. The Offer is
subject to a number of conditions, including the negotiation of a definitive
merger agreement and regulatory approvals under Canadian and U.S. antitrust
legislation. The Canadian Competition Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission
(United States) are reviewing the transaction. The waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act will expire on May 27, 2009. On
March 27, 2009, Agrium announced an increase in the cash portion to $35.00, for
an aggregate consideration of $1.8 billion in cash and 50.2 million shares. The
Offer and withdrawal rights will expire on May 19, 2009, unless extended. The CF
board of directors has rejected the Offer.

Agrium is fully committed to acquiring CF and continues to seek the engagement
of CF board of directors in discussions with Agrium regarding a mutually
beneficial transaction for our respective shareholders. Agrium has had extensive
discussions with CF shareholders, who have advised Agrium that they favour a
combination between Agrium and CF and want the CF board to engage in discussions
with us. Agrium is prepared to increase its Offer further if CF can demonstrate
additional value.

The rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") do not require that we obtain
the approval of our shareholders, but the TSX has the discretion to require us
to obtain shareholder approval. During February 2009, we acquired 1.2 million
shares of CF at an average cost of $52.34 for the total consideration of
$65-million, the maximum allowed under FTC regulations. The shares are
classified for accounting purposes as available for sale with changes to the
fair value being recorded in other comprehensive income. At March 31, 2009, the
fair value of the CF shares was $88-million.

EGYPT NITROGEN PROJECT

<PAGE>

In the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with MOPCO, whereby
MOPCO would acquire EAgrium and all related contractual obligations through a
share exchange. The share exchange was completed on January 26, 2009, which
resulted in our owning 26 percent of MOPCO. We no longer control our Egyptian
operations and we account for our investment in MOPCO in the Wholesale business
unit using the equity method.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS ("IFRS")

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' Accounting Standards Board has
published its strategic plan for convergence of Canadian generally accepted
accounting standards with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board. The changeover date for Canadian publicly accountable
enterprises is January 1, 2011 and will require restatement of comparative
figures.

Agrium is currently in the design and development phase of its IFRS transition
plan. To date, progress remains on plan for a successful IFRS implementation.

At this time, the full impact of transitioning to IFRS on the Company's future
financial position and future operational results is not reasonably determinable
or estimable. We continue to assess the available transitional exemption options
along with the accounting policies under IFRS and the resulting impacts.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary
measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net
earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings
before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of performance
because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of
historical performance for the different business segments. Similarly, financing
and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all business segments on a
basis that is meaningful for comparison with other companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should
not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating activities
as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net earnings as
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

BUSINESS RISKS

The information presented on business risks on pages 85 - 90 in our 2008 Annual
Report has not changed materially since December 31, 2008.

CONTROLS & PROCEDURES

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Prices for most grains and oilseeds are lower than last year but remain well
above the previous five year average. With volatility in both crop and crop
input prices, there has been a greater degree of uncertainty over planting
intentions in the Northern Hemisphere than usual this spring. The March 31

<PAGE>

USDA Prospective Plantings report surprised many analysts with higher corn and
lower soybean acreage than expected. Another surprising result in the report was
that overall planted cropland was projected to be down 7.5 million acres (or 2
percent) in the U.S. If that level of acreage reduction were realized on a
global scale, the impact on world crop production would be significant.

The global economic slow-down has led to some reduction in the forecast for
global feed-grain consumption. This combined with record yields last year will
result in an increase in the expected global grain ending stocks this year,
although the global grain stocks-to-use ratio is expected to remain low by
historic standards. Farm operating expenses including fertilizer, fuel, and
other inputs are forecast to decline significantly in 2009 for the first time
since 2002, which is expected to be supportive to farm margins.

North American demand for crop protection products and services is generally
expected to be good this spring, although demand has been somewhat delayed due
to the wet weather. The continued relatively high corn acreage, wet weather and
reduced crop nutrient applications in the fall is expected to support this
market segment. Glyphosate demand will be lower than last year due to farmers
switching to more conventional forms of weed control such as plowing/tilling.
Seed and application services by North American growers is expected to be strong
in the second quarter of 2009.

The nitrogen market has been under pressure in the past few weeks, as demand has
been sluggish and supply has increased due to plants coming back on stream in
Western Europe. In addition, exportable urea supplies are expected to increase
with the start-up of the new plant in Sohar, Oman. In the U.S., urea inventories
were reported by The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) to be 29 percent below 2008
levels at the end of March. Nitrogen margins in North America, and more recently
Europe, have been supported by reduced natural gas prices. Current urea prices
are believed to be at, or below, the breakeven cost of production for producers
in the Ukraine, where the Government has set a 2009 natural gas sales price
significantly above European and North American spot prices. A risk to the
market is alternative arrangements by Gazprom to sell direct to Ukrainian
producers which could lower the purchase price for natural gas and reduce the
floor price and/or a significant increase in urea exports from China when the
export tax is lowered to 10 percent this summer.

Global demand and trade levels for potash have been significantly reduced in
2009, but new contracts completed by the major exporters indicate that the price
has remained relatively firm to date. Key reasons for the significant drop in
demand has been the delayed contract negotiations with China and India, credit
issues globally and reduced application rates due to the reduction in crop
prices compared to the previous year. The conclusion of negotiations with China
and India will reduce the uncertainty in the market and should support the
resumption of more normal trade levels with other buyers. While there have been
significant potash production curtailments globally, inventories remain at high
levels. We expect that demand will strengthen significantly in the fall of 2009,
to make up for the significant decline in potash demand in the 2008/09
fertilizer year.

Demand for phosphate has also demonstrated a significant decline in 2008/09.
India remains a very important player in the phosphate market. Indian DAP
imports from the U.S. are up 21 percent in the fertilizer year to date and they
have been the destination for over half of U.S. DAP and MAP exports.

<PAGE>

U.S. DAP and MAP inventories have fallen 24 percent since peaking in December,
and dropped in March despite a 40 percent increase in production from February,
2009; however, they remain higher than average. Looking forward, most analysts
expect that India will continue to be a major importer in 2009 and that activity
from other importers will pick up in the fall, which would be expected to
tighten supplies. A risk to the phosphate market is increased export supply from
China in June and July as well as the end of the year when the export tax is
reduced.

Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three months ended March 31, 2009
(Millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)
(Unaudited)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company's accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in Canada and are consistent with those outlined in the
annual audited financial statements except where stated below. These interim
consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures normally
provided in annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with
the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2008. In management's opinion, the interim consolidated financial
statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Sales are concentrated
in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are
accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally occur after the
planting seasons in North and South America.

Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current
year's presentation.

The Company had been developing a urea facility through its EAgrium subsidiary.
EAgrium construction was halted by the Egyptian government due to local
opposition in April 2008. In August 2008, the Company negotiated an alternative
agreement with the government resulting in Agrium acquiring a 26 percent equity
position in an existing Egyptian nitrogen production facility owned by MISR Oil
Processing Company, S.A.E. ("MOPCO") of Egypt. The MOPCO facility started
commercial production in the summer of 2008. Agrium acquired its 26 percent
interest through an agreement exchanging its shares and all related contractual
obligations of EAgrium for shares in MOPCO. Following completion of the
agreement on January 26, 2009, Agrium no longer controls its Egypt operations
and accounts for its investment in MOPCO in the Wholesale business unit using
the equity method.

As at December 31, 2008, the Company adjusted the carrying value of its Egypt
operations based on the fair value of the MOPCO interest received. Prior to such
adjustment, the Egypt operations had a net carrying value of $295-million (net
of non-controlling interest). The major categories of assets and liabilities of
the EAgrium subsidiary were production assets under construction, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, and long-term debt. On adjusting the Egypt
operations to fair value of $250-million, the Company

<PAGE>

recorded an impairment charge in its Wholesale business unit of $87-million
($45-million net of non-controlling interest).

The Company determined the fair value of the interest in MOPCO using an income
approach, discounting a range of possible outcomes, with each possible outcome
bearing different risk factors, at a risk-free rate plus an adjustment for the
risk factors of each scenario. The analysis included various management
estimates about future revenue, operating margins, growth rates, discount rates,
terminal value and non-controlling interest discount. The assumptions included
anticipated future cash flows, budgets and long-term business plans, marketplace
information, industry data, economic analysis and contracts in place at the time
of the analysis. Actual results could differ from management's estimates and
assumptions, potentially resulting in future impairment losses.

Hanfeng Evergreen Inc. is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The investment
is carried in the Advanced Technologies operating segment. The Company's share
of earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $2-million (three
months ended March 31, 2008 - $1-million). The Company's portion of cumulative
undistributed earnings of Hanfeng at March 31, 2009 of $6-million (March 31,
2008 - $1-million) is included in retained earnings.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Risk management

In the normal course of business, the Company's financial position, results of
operation and cash flows are exposed to various risks. On an annual basis, the
Board approves a strategic plan that takes into account the opportunities and
major risks of the Company's business and mitigation factors to reduce these
risks. The Board also reviews risk management policies and procedures on an
annual basis and sets upper limits on the transactional exposure to be managed
and the time periods over which exposures may be managed. The Company manages
risk in accordance with its Exposure Management Policy. The objective of the
policy is to reduce volatility in cash flow and earnings.

Sensitivity analysis to risk is provided where the effect on net earnings or
shareholders' equity could be material. Sensitivity analysis is performed by
relating the reasonably possible changes in the risk variable at March 31, 2009
to financial instruments outstanding on that date while assuming all other
variables remain constant.

Market risk

(a) Currency risk

U.S. dollar denominated transactions in our Canadian operations generates
foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognized in net earnings. The U.S.
dollar denominated balance in Canadian operations is $897-million. A
strengthening of $0.01 in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar would have
increased net earnings by $6-million.

A foreign currency translation adjustment is recognized in other comprehensive
income upon translation of our Canadian and European operations to U.S. dollars.
A strengthening of $0.01 of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would
have an impact of less than $1-million on comprehensive income. A $0.01
weakening of the Canadian dollar would have an equal but opposite impact. A
strengthening of $0.01 of the Euro against the U.S. dollar would have an impact
of less than $1-million on comprehensive income. A $0.01 weakening of the Euro
would have an equal but opposite impact.

(b) Commodity price risk

For natural gas derivative financial instruments outstanding at March 31, 2009,
an increase of $0.10 per MMBtu would have increased net earnings by $3-million.
A $0.10 decrease per MMBtu would have an equal but opposite impact.

(c) Interest rate risk

The Company's cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a
term of three months or less that earn interest at market rates. The Company
manages its interest rate risk on these investments by maximizing the interest
income earned on excess funds while maintaining the liquidity necessary to
conduct operations on a day-to-day basis. Fluctuations in market rates of
interest on cash and cash equivalents do not have a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations due to the short term to maturity of the
investments.

Credit risk

There were no significant uncollectible trade receivable balances at March 31,
2009.

<PAGE>

The Company may be exposed to certain losses in the event that counterparties to
short-term investments and derivative financial instruments are unable to meet
their contractual obligations. The Company manages this counterparty credit risk
with policies requiring that counterparties to short-term investments and
derivative financial instruments have an investment grade or higher credit
rating and policies that limit the investing of excess funds to liquid
instruments with a maximum term of one year and limit the maximum exposure to
any one counterparty. The Company also enters into master netting agreements
that mitigate its exposure to counterparty credit risk. At March 31, 2009, all
counterparties to derivative financial instruments have maintained an investment
grade or higher credit rating and there is no indication that any counterparty
will be unable to meet their obligations under derivative financial instruments.

Liquidity risk

The Company's bank indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued liabilities
generally have contractual maturities of six months or less.

Fair values

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank
indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate carrying
value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of floating-rate loans
approximates their carrying value.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is recorded as the estimated
amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. Fair
values are determined based on quoted market prices available from active
markets or are otherwise determined using a variety of valuation techniques and
models. The Company's derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on
a recurring basis are derivative financial instruments measured using
information classified as Level 2.

The fair value of long-term debt at March 31, 2009 was $1,473-million (March 31,
2008 - $957-million, December 31, 2008 - $1,578-million). The carrying value of
long-term debt at March 31, 2009 was $1,625-million (March 31, 2008 -
$896-million, December 31, 2008 - $1,634-million). The weighted-average
effective interest rate on long-term debt at March 31, 2009, was 6 percent
(March 31, 2008 - 8 percent, December 31, 2008 - 6 percent). The fair value

of long-term debt is determined using valuation techniques based on quoted
prices for similar instruments.

11. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Company manages capital by monitoring the ratios outlined in the table
below. Net debt includes bank indebtedness and long-term debt including the

<PAGE>

current portion, net of cash and cash equivalents. Equity includes shareholders'
equity. EBITDA is net (loss) earnings before interest expense, income taxes,
depreciation, amortization and asset impairment. Interest includes interest on
long-term debt plus other interest. The measures of debt, equity and EBITDA
described above are non-GAAP financial measures which do not have a standardized
meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to
similar measures presented by other issuers.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

May 6, 2009

The following interim management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") updates our
annual MD&A included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, to which our
readers are referred. No update is provided where an item is not material or
there has been no material change from the discussion in our annual MD&A.
Forward-Looking Statements are outlined after the Outlook, Key Risks and
Uncertainties section of this press release. The major assumptions made in
preparing our first half guidance are outlined below and include, but are not
limited to:

- - Crop and fertilizer prices through the second quarter of 2009 approximating
current prices;

- - Retail fertilizer sales volumes and gross margin percentages significantly
below 2008 second quarter levels;

- - Wholesale nitrogen and phosphate sales volumes for the second quarter
consistent with levels in the same quarter of 2008;

- - Wholesale potash sales volumes significantly below second quarter 2008 levels;

- - Wholesale purchase for resale sales volumes approximately double second
quarter of 2008 levels due to the impact of acquisitions;

<PAGE>

- - Wholesale production volumes below levels in the same quarter of 2008 with
potash and phosphate production operating significantly below capacity due to
market driven outages and turnarounds;

(1) See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

- - Average NYMEX gas price for the second quarter not deviating significantly
from $4.40/MMBtu;

- - The exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, expressed in U.S. dollars,
averaging C$1.28 to U.S.$1.00;

- - The guidance does not reflect the potential completion of a CF deal in the
second quarter of 2009;

- - Urea sales prices to Argentine growers approximating import prices rather than
a government capped price;

- - Stock based compensation expense reflecting Agrium's stock price at the close
of business on May 4, 2009 (U.S.$46.96) and a $1 change in stock price equating
to approximately a $0.01 change in earnings per share; and,

- - The exclusion of mark-to-market gains or losses on non-qualifying commodity
hedge positions settling in future periods.

2009 First Quarter Operating Results

NET EARNINGS

Agrium's first quarter consolidated net loss was $60-million, or $0.38 diluted
loss per share, compared to net earnings of $195-million, or $1.23 diluted
earnings per share, for the same quarter of 2008. Net earnings before interest
expense and income taxes ("EBIT") was a loss of $56-million for the first
quarter of 2009 compared with EBIT of $305-million for the first quarter of
2008. The decrease in EBIT was primarily due to lower gross profit from reduced
potash sales volumes and lower selling prices for most products, as well as
certain items noted below. A reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings is provided
in the section "Non-GAAP Measures".

Consolidated gross profit in the first quarter of 2009 was $273-million compared
to $392-million in the first quarter of 2008. Contributions from the UAP
business, partially offset by higher cost of inventory purchased when fertilizer
prices were higher, resulted in a $27-million increase in gross profit in our
Retail business unit. Wholesale gross profit decreased by $156-million primarily
due to the large decline in potash sales volumes, lower prices for nitrogen,
phosphate and product purchased for resale. Quarter-over-quarter gross profit
for Advanced Technologies decreased $7-million due largely to volume decline in
turf and ornamental products.

Expenses have increased $242-million quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting
a combination of the following items:

- - $99-million increase in Retail's selling expense resulting in selling expense
of $198-million primarily due to the UAP business; and

<PAGE>

- - $136-million increase in loss on derivative contracts primarily related to gas
and power, resulting in $69-million hedging loss.

The effective tax rate was 31 percent for the first quarter of 2009, compared to
33 percent for the same quarter of 2008.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PEFORMANCE

Retail

Retail results are not directly comparable to the same period last year due to
the inclusion of UAP, which was acquired in May of 2008. Retail's 2009 first
quarter net sales were just over $1-billion, which was more than double the
$394-million in the first quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $142-million in the
first quarter of 2009, compared to $115-million for the same period last year.
While gross profit was $27-million higher than last year, EBIT was significantly
lower due to the higher selling and general and administrative costs associated
with the addition of the UAP business. Retail EBIT was a loss of $94-million in
the first quarter of 2009, versus a positive EBIT of $4-million in the first
quarter of 2008 and a loss of $21-million in the first quarter of 2007.

Crop nutrients net sales reached $437-million this quarter, an increase of
$188-million compared to the first quarter of 2008, due to the addition of UAP
business and higher average selling prices. Gross profit was $18-million this
quarter compared to $72-million in the first quarter of 2008. The decrease was
primarily due to lower margins resulting from the carryover of higher priced
crop nutrient inventories from the fall of 2008, which have been sold into a
lower price environment this spring. This resulted in crop nutrient margins
declining to an unprecedented 4 percent in the first quarter of 2009, compared
to 29 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Over the past 10 years, retail crop
nutrient margins in the first quarter have averaged 23 percent and the previous
lowest year was in 2006 at 21 percent. Crop nutrient margins continue to rise in
the second quarter of 2009 and are expected to reach normal levels once the
majority of the higher priced nutrient inventory position is sold, which is
anticipated by the end of the spring season.(1) Nutrient sales volumes in the
first quarter were also impacted by the late start to the spring season and what
is expected to be lower demand for potash and phosphate through the spring
compared to the same period last year. Sales volumes and margins at our South
American operations were also significantly lower this quarter than the same
period last year due to extremely dry conditions and the added challenge of
uncertainty over government policies.

Crop protection net sales increased to $426-million this quarter, compared to
$93-million in the first quarter of 2008. Our gross profit this quarter reached
$77-million, more than double last year's $29-million. The strength of earnings
from this product line illustrates the benefits of the diversity in our Retail
business. Most of the increase in sales and gross profits was due to the
addition of UAP's significant crop protection business, including a broad range
of private label products. Crop protection product margins as a percentage of
net sales were 18 percent for the first quarter of 2009 versus 31 percent for
the first quarter of 2008. The lower margin was primarily due to the inclusion
of UAP's substantial wholesale crop protection business, which has a
significantly lower percentage margin than the retail portion of the business.
Last year's figure also benefited from inventory appreciation for glyphosate
products which is not expected to occur in 2009.

<PAGE>

(1) See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

Net sales for seed, services and other increased to $188-million this quarter
from $52-million in the first quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $47-million in
the first quarter of 2009, compared to $14-million for the same period last year
and slightly ahead of last year after accounting for the addition of UAP's
business.

Retail selling expenses for the first quarter of 2009 were $198-million, double
last year's level, due to the inclusion of UAP's business and in line with our
expectations. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter
of 2009 was 19 percent compared to 25 percent for the same period last year.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were $695-million for the first quarter of 2009 compared
to $708-million for the first quarter of 2008. Lower sales volumes and prices
for nitrogen and phosphate and substantially lower potash sales volumes, were
largely offset by higher potash selling prices and increased product purchased
for resale sales volumes reflecting the CMF acquisition. The decrease in sales
volumes in the first quarter of 2009 was a result of a cautious approach to
replenishing stocks by retailers and distributors, lower grower demand for
potash and phosphate, and weather delays impacting the start of the spring
season in some markets.

Gross profit was $117-million in the first quarter of 2009, a $156-million
reduction from the $273-million recorded for the same period last year. EBIT of
$57-million in the first quarter of 2009 was also lower than the $313-million
for the same period last year due primarily to lower sales volumes for all three
nutrients, and in particular for potash, lower sales prices for nitrogen and
phosphate and higher cost of potash as a result of production curtailments.

Gross profit for nitrogen was $55-million this quarter, compared to $126-million
in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen prices were lower than the same period
last year across all products for both benchmark and Agrium's realized prices.
Sales volumes were 12 percent lower than the same period last year, due to lower
sales from Profertil and lower UAN sales volumes. Cost of product was $258 per
tonne this quarter, slightly lower than last year, as lower North American gas
prices were largely offset by higher costs associated with market related plant
shutdowns or reduced operating rates at a number of our facilities in 2009. The
continued decline in North American gas costs through the first quarter of 2009
was not fully reflected in our average cost of product this quarter due to
higher cost of product drawn from opening inventory. Agrium's nitrogen margins
averaged $82 per tonne this quarter, compared with $164 per tonne in the first
quarter of last year. Urea margins remained well over $100 per tonne, while
ammonia and UAN margins were challenged due to the lower operating rate for
these two product groups and the much higher proportion of ammonia sales that go
to the lower margin industrial business in the first quarter.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $5.64/MMBtu in the first quarter of 2009
versus $6.42/MMBtu in the first quarter of 2008. The U.S. benchmark (NYMEX)
natural gas price for the first quarter of 2009 was $4.86/MMBtu,

<PAGE>

versus $8.07/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $6.82/MMBtu in the fourth
quarter of 2008. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential narrowed to $0.32/MMBtu
for the first quarter of 2009. Agrium's average gas cost was higher than NYMEX
this quarter due to realized losses on gas purchase contracts. We anticipate a
significant decline in our overall gas cost in the second quarter of 2009.(1)

Phosphate gross profit was $26-million, compared to $44-million for the same
quarter last year. Realized sales price of $559 per tonne was slightly less than
$612 achieved in the same quarter last year. Sales volumes were 13 percent lower
than the same quarter last year, but were significantly higher than the fourth
quarter of 2008. Phosphate cost of product was $430 per tonne, a $59 per tonne
decrease over the previous quarter and an increase of $8 per tonne compared to
the same period last year. The over 10 percent decrease in cost versus the
previous quarter was due primarily to lower ammonia and sulphur costs and the
lower value of the Canadian dollar. Gross margin for phosphate was $129 per
tonne compared with $190 per tonne in the first quarter of 2008.

Gross profit for potash was $21-million versus $87-million in the first quarter
of 2008. Realized selling prices were almost double last year's levels, however
this was not enough to offset the impact of a significant decrease in sales
volumes and higher per unit costs. Sales volumes decreased by 373,000 tonnes
compared to the same period last year. International and domestic demand
declined as a result of delivery contract expirations in China, credit issues in
many other international markets and an increasingly cautious approach to
replenishing stocks by retailers and distributors in North America and globally.
Cost of product increased substantially from the fourth quarter of 2008 because
of lower production volumes resulting in a larger proportion of fixed costs
being allocated to fewer sales tonnes. Gross margin on a per tonne basis was
$276 per tonne, which was well above the $194 per tonne in the first quarter of
last year.

Net sales for product purchased for resale were more than five times that of
last year's levels, largely due to the addition of the European CMF business.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2009 was $2-million, or $4-million lower
than the same period last year. The reduction was due to an $18-million
inventory write-down this quarter as a result of net realizable value
adjustments to our purchased product inventories.

Wholesale expenses were significantly higher than last year as a result of
unrealized net mark-to-market losses of $31-million from natural gas and power
derivatives and realized losses of $33-million on natural gas and power
derivatives, compared to unrealized gains of $63-million and realized gains of
$4-million on these derivatives the previous year. This was partially offset by
a decrease in potash profit and capital taxes of $40-million due mainly to lower
potash sales volumes.

2009 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' first quarter 2009 net sales were $67-million compared to
$79-million in the first quarter of 2008. Net sales and gross profit were
impacted by reduced volumes and margins in the turf and ornamental segment.

<PAGE>

This was due to lower household expenditures given the economic downturn, and
some customers deferring purchases of controlled-release products across a
variety of end-markets. However, our ESN net sales increased due to a 38 percent
increase in ESN sales volumes this quarter, which more than offset lower ESN
prices, due to the 26 percent decline in benchmark urea prices. Gross profit for
Advanced Technologies was $10-million for the quarter, compared with $17-million
for the same period last year, while EBITDA was $6-million, a decrease of
$4-million versus the comparable period in 2008. The reduction in profit and
earnings was due to weaker demand and margins from a number of our
controlled-release products other than ESN, due to lower housing starts and a
depressed economy. In the first quarter, ESN accounted for 33 percent of
Advanced Technologies' gross profit, more than double the same period last year.

In April, Agrium issued a notice exercising its option to acquire 50 percent of
the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of Hanfeng Slow Release
Fertilizer (Canada) Co. Ltd. ("Subco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hanfeng
Evergreen Inc. Subco owns a 50 percent interest through a joint venture
arrangement in a sulfur coated urea (SCU) production facility in China with
annual production of 50,000 tonnes. Agrium's total investment in the project is
anticipated to be approximately $3-million.

Other

EBIT for our Other non-operating business unit for the first quarter of 2009 was
a loss of $20-million, relatively unchanged compared to a loss of $18-million
for the first quarter of 2008.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities was $68-million in the first quarter of
2009, a decrease of $322-million from $390-million in the same period of 2008.
Driving this change was a decrease of $255-million in net earnings and a
$223-million increase in non-cash working capital, partially offset by
unrealized loss on gas and power derivative contracts and unrealized foreign
exchange loss from the revaluation of Canadian denominated payables in U.S.
companies and U.S. denominated receivables in Canadian companies.

Cash used in investing activities decreased by $2-million in the first quarter
of 2009 due to lower capital expenditures offset by the $65-million purchase of
CF shares (discussed further under the section "Business Acquisition") in the
first quarter of 2009.

Cash used in financing activities was $201-million in the first quarter of 2009
compared with cash provided by financing activities of $3-million in the same
period in 2008. The change was due to a higher pay-down of our bank

indebtedness from supplier rebates received in the first quarter of 2009 and

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently,
quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. Sales are concentrated
in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are
accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally occur after the
planting seasons in North and South America.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 25, 2009, Agrium submitted a proposal to the board of directors of
CF to acquire all of the capital stock of CF for cash and Agrium shares at
$72.00 per CF share, or a total of approximately $3.6-billion, based on the
closing price of Agrium shares on February 24, 2009. Agrium would fund the cash
portion through available liquidity and committed financing. The board of
directors of CF rejected Agrium's proposal on March 9, 2009.

On March 16, 2009, Agrium commenced an exchange offer for all of the outstanding
shares of CF (the "Offer"), pursuant to which CF stockholders would receive
$31.70 in cash plus one common share of Agrium for each CF share. The Offer is
subject to a number of conditions, including the negotiation of a definitive
merger agreement and regulatory approvals under Canadian and U.S. antitrust
legislation. The Canadian Competition Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission
(United States) are reviewing the transaction. The waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act will expire on May 27, 2009. On
March 27, 2009, Agrium announced an increase in the cash portion to $35.00, for
an aggregate consideration of $1.8 billion in cash and 50.2 million shares. The
Offer and withdrawal rights will expire on May 19, 2009, unless extended. The CF
board of directors has rejected the Offer.

Agrium is fully committed to acquiring CF and continues to seek the engagement
of CF board of directors in discussions with Agrium regarding a mutually
beneficial transaction for our respective shareholders. Agrium has had extensive
discussions with CF shareholders, who have advised Agrium that they favour a
combination between Agrium and CF and want the CF board to engage in discussions
with us. Agrium is prepared to increase its Offer further if CF can demonstrate
additional value.

The rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") do not require that we obtain
the approval of our shareholders, but the TSX has the discretion to require us
to obtain shareholder approval. During February 2009, we acquired 1.2 million
shares of CF at an average cost of $52.34 for the total consideration of
$65-million, the maximum allowed under FTC regulations. The shares are
classified for accounting purposes as available for sale with changes to the
fair value being recorded in other comprehensive income. At March 31, 2009, the
fair value of the CF shares was $88-million.

EGYPT NITROGEN PROJECT

<PAGE>

In the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with MOPCO, whereby
MOPCO would acquire EAgrium and all related contractual obligations through a
share exchange. The share exchange was completed on January 26, 2009, which
resulted in our owning 26 percent of MOPCO. We no longer control our Egyptian
operations and we account for our investment in MOPCO in the Wholesale business
unit using the equity method.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS ("IFRS")

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' Accounting Standards Board has
published its strategic plan for convergence of Canadian generally accepted
accounting standards with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board. The changeover date for Canadian publicly accountable
enterprises is January 1, 2011 and will require restatement of comparative
figures.

Agrium is currently in the design and development phase of its IFRS transition
plan. To date, progress remains on plan for a successful IFRS implementation.

At this time, the full impact of transitioning to IFRS on the Company's future
financial position and future operational results is not reasonably determinable
or estimable. We continue to assess the available transitional exemption options
along with the accounting policies under IFRS and the resulting impacts.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary
measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net
earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings
before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of performance
because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of
historical performance for the different business segments. Similarly, financing
and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all business segments on a
basis that is meaningful for comparison with other companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should
not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating activities
as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net earnings as
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Prices for most grains and oilseeds are lower than last year but remain well
above the previous five year average. With volatility in both crop and crop
input prices, there has been a greater degree of uncertainty over planting
intentions in the Northern Hemisphere than usual this spring. The March 31

<PAGE>

USDA Prospective Plantings report surprised many analysts with higher corn and
lower soybean acreage than expected. Another surprising result in the report was
that overall planted cropland was projected to be down 7.5 million acres (or 2
percent) in the U.S. If that level of acreage reduction were realized on a
global scale, the impact on world crop production would be significant.

The global economic slow-down has led to some reduction in the forecast for
global feed-grain consumption. This combined with record yields last year will
result in an increase in the expected global grain ending stocks this year,
although the global grain stocks-to-use ratio is expected to remain low by
historic standards. Farm operating expenses including fertilizer, fuel, and
other inputs are forecast to decline significantly in 2009 for the first time
since 2002, which is expected to be supportive to farm margins.

North American demand for crop protection products and services is generally
expected to be good this spring, although demand has been somewhat delayed due
to the wet weather. The continued relatively high corn acreage, wet weather and
reduced crop nutrient applications in the fall is expected to support this
market segment. Glyphosate demand will be lower than last year due to farmers
switching to more conventional forms of weed control such as plowing/tilling.
Seed and application services by North American growers is expected to be strong
in the second quarter of 2009.

The nitrogen market has been under pressure in the past few weeks, as demand has
been sluggish and supply has increased due to plants coming back on stream in
Western Europe. In addition, exportable urea supplies are expected to increase
with the start-up of the new plant in Sohar, Oman. In the U.S., urea inventories
were reported by The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) to be 29 percent below 2008
levels at the end of March. Nitrogen margins in North America, and more recently
Europe, have been supported by reduced natural gas prices. Current urea prices
are believed to be at, or below, the breakeven cost of production for producers
in the Ukraine, where the Government has set a 2009 natural gas sales price
significantly above European and North American spot prices. A risk to the
market is alternative arrangements by Gazprom to sell direct to Ukrainian
producers which could lower the purchase price for natural gas and reduce the
floor price and/or a significant increase in urea exports from China when the
export tax is lowered to 10 percent this summer.

Global demand and trade levels for potash have been significantly reduced in
2009, but new contracts completed by the major exporters indicate that the price
has remained relatively firm to date. Key reasons for the significant drop in
demand has been the delayed contract negotiations with China and India, credit
issues globally and reduced application rates due to the reduction in crop
prices compared to the previous year. The conclusion of negotiations with China
and India will reduce the uncertainty in the market and should support the
resumption of more normal trade levels with other buyers. While there have been
significant potash production curtailments globally, inventories remain at high
levels. We expect that demand will strengthen significantly in the fall of 2009,
to make up for the significant decline in potash demand in the 2008/09
fertilizer year.

Demand for phosphate has also demonstrated a significant decline in 2008/09.
India remains a very important player in the phosphate market. Indian DAP
imports from the U.S. are up 21 percent in the fertilizer year to date and they
have been the destination for over half of U.S. DAP and MAP exports.

<PAGE>

U.S. DAP and MAP inventories have fallen 24 percent since peaking in December,
and dropped in March despite a 40 percent increase in production from February,
2009; however, they remain higher than average. Looking forward, most analysts
expect that India will continue to be a major importer in 2009 and that activity
from other importers will pick up in the fall, which would be expected to
tighten supplies. A risk to the phosphate market is increased export supply from
China in June and July as well as the end of the year when the export tax is
reduced.

AGRIUM INC.
Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three months ended March 31, 2009
(Millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)
(Unaudited)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company's accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in Canada and are consistent with those outlined in the
annual audited financial statements except where stated below. These interim
consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures normally
provided in annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with
the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2008. In management's opinion, the interim consolidated financial
statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Sales are concentrated
in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are
accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally occur after the
planting seasons in North and South America.

Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current
year's presentation.

The Company had been developing a urea facility through its EAgrium subsidiary.
EAgrium construction was halted by the Egyptian government due to local
opposition in April 2008. In August 2008, the Company negotiated an alternative

position in an existing Egyptian nitrogen production facility owned by MISR Oil
Processing Company, S.A.E. ("MOPCO") of Egypt. The MOPCO facility started
commercial production in the summer of 2008. Agrium acquired its 26 percent
interest through an agreement exchanging its shares and all related contractual
obligations of EAgrium for shares in MOPCO. Following completion of the
agreement on January 26, 2009, Agrium no longer controls its Egypt operations
and accounts for its investment in MOPCO in the Wholesale business unit using
the equity method.

As at December 31, 2008, the Company adjusted the carrying value of its Egypt
operations based on the fair value of the MOPCO interest received. Prior to such
adjustment, the Egypt operations had a net carrying value of $295-million (net
of non-controlling interest). The major categories of assets and liabilities of
the EAgrium subsidiary were production assets under construction, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, and long-term debt. On adjusting the Egypt
operations to fair value of $250-million, the Company

<PAGE>

recorded an impairment charge in its Wholesale business unit of $87-million
($45-million net of non-controlling interest).

The Company determined the fair value of the interest in MOPCO using an income
approach, discounting a range of possible outcomes, with each possible outcome
bearing different risk factors, at a risk-free rate plus an adjustment for the
risk factors of each scenario. The analysis included various management
estimates about future revenue, operating margins, growth rates, discount rates,
terminal value and non-controlling interest discount. The assumptions included
anticipated future cash flows, budgets and long-term business plans, marketplace
information, industry data, economic analysis and contracts in place at the time
of the analysis. Actual results could differ from management's estimates and
assumptions, potentially resulting in future impairment losses.

Hanfeng Evergreen Inc. is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The investment
is carried in the Advanced Technologies operating segment. The Company's share
of earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $2-million (three
months ended March 31, 2008 - $1-million). The Company's portion of cumulative
undistributed earnings of Hanfeng at March 31, 2009 of $6-million (March 31,
2008 - $1-million) is included in retained earnings.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Risk management

In the normal course of business, the Company's financial position, results of
operation and cash flows are exposed to various risks. On an annual basis, the
Board approves a strategic plan that takes into account the opportunities and
major risks of the Company's business and mitigation factors to reduce these
risks. The Board also reviews risk management policies and procedures on an
annual basis and sets upper limits on the transactional exposure to be managed
and the time periods over which exposures may be managed. The Company manages
risk in accordance with its Exposure Management Policy. The objective of the
policy is to reduce volatility in cash flow and earnings.

Sensitivity analysis to risk is provided where the effect on net earnings or
shareholders' equity could be material. Sensitivity analysis is performed by
relating the reasonably possible changes in the risk variable at March 31, 2009
to financial instruments outstanding on that date while assuming all other
variables remain constant.

Market risk

(a) Currency risk

U.S. dollar denominated transactions in our Canadian operations generates
foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognized in net earnings. The U.S.
dollar denominated balance in Canadian operations is $897-million. A
strengthening of $0.01 in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar would have
increased net earnings by $6-million.

A foreign currency translation adjustment is recognized in other comprehensive
income upon translation of our Canadian and European operations to U.S. dollars.
A strengthening of $0.01 of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would
have an impact of less than $1-million on comprehensive income. A $0.01
weakening of the Canadian dollar would have an equal but opposite impact. A
strengthening of $0.01 of the Euro against the U.S. dollar would have an impact
of less than $1-million on comprehensive income. A $0.01 weakening of the Euro
would have an equal but opposite impact.

(b) Commodity price risk

For natural gas derivative financial instruments outstanding at March 31, 2009,
an increase of $0.10 per MMBtu would have increased net earnings by $3-million.
A $0.10 decrease per MMBtu would have an equal but opposite impact.

(c) Interest rate risk

The Company's cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a
term of three months or less that earn interest at market rates. The Company
manages its interest rate risk on these investments by maximizing the interest
income earned on excess funds while maintaining the liquidity necessary to
conduct operations on a day-to-day basis. Fluctuations in market rates of
interest on cash and cash equivalents do not have a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations due to the short term to maturity of the
investments.

Credit risk

There were no significant uncollectible trade receivable balances at March 31,
2009.

<PAGE>

The Company may be exposed to certain losses in the event that counterparties to
short-term investments and derivative financial instruments are unable to meet
their contractual obligations. The Company manages this counterparty credit risk
with policies requiring that counterparties to short-term investments and
derivative financial instruments have an investment grade or higher credit
rating and policies that limit the investing of excess funds to liquid
instruments with a maximum term of one year and limit the maximum exposure to
any one counterparty. The Company also enters into master netting agreements
that mitigate its exposure to counterparty credit risk. At March 31, 2009, all
counterparties to derivative financial instruments have maintained an investment
grade or higher credit rating and there is no indication that any counterparty
will be unable to meet their obligations under derivative financial instruments.

Liquidity risk

The Company's bank indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued liabilities
generally have contractual maturities of six months or less.

Fair values

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank
indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate carrying
value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of floating-rate loans
approximates their carrying value.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is recorded as the estimated
amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. Fair
values are determined based on quoted market prices available from active
markets or are otherwise determined using a variety of valuation techniques and
models. The Company's derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on
a recurring basis are derivative financial instruments measured using
information classified as Level 2.

The fair value of long-term debt at March 31, 2009 was $1,473-million (March 31,
2008 - $957-million, December 31, 2008 - $1,578-million). The carrying value of
long-term debt at March 31, 2009 was $1,625-million (March 31, 2008 -
$896-million, December 31, 2008 - $1,634-million). The weighted-average
effective interest rate on long-term debt at March 31, 2009, was 6 percent
(March 31, 2008 - 8 percent, December 31, 2008 - 6 percent). The fair value

of long-term debt is determined using valuation techniques based on quoted
prices for similar instruments.

11. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Company manages capital by monitoring the ratios outlined in the table
below. Net debt includes bank indebtedness and long-term debt including the

<PAGE>

current portion, net of cash and cash equivalents. Equity includes shareholders'
equity. EBITDA is net (loss) earnings before interest expense, income taxes,
depreciation, amortization and asset impairment. Interest includes interest on
long-term debt plus other interest. The measures of debt, equity and EBITDA
described above are non-GAAP financial measures which do not have a standardized
meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to
similar measures presented by other issuers.
