	    Attention Business/Financial Editors:
	    Advantage Announces Monthly Distribution

	    (TSX: AVN.UN, NYSE: AAV)

	    CALGARY, Feb. 12 /CNW/ - As a result of continuing weakness in crude oil
and natural gas prices, the Board of Directors of Advantage Energy Income Fund
("Advantage" or the "Fund") has approved a reduction in the cash distribution
for the month of February 2009 to $0.04 per Unit from the current $0.08 per
Unit. The reduced cash distribution will improve Advantage's balance sheet and
preserve cash flow for our ongoing capital program.
	    Advantage has also increased commodity hedging in 2009 to 56% of our net
natural gas production at an average floor price of Cdn $8.09 per mcf and 46%
of our net crude oil production at an average floor price of Cdn $69.38 per
barrel. For 2010, 49% of our net natural gas production is now hedged at Cdn
$7.46 per mcf and 26% of our net crude oil production is hedged at an average
floor price of Cdn $67.83 per barrel. Complete commodity hedging details are
available on our website.
	    The distribution will be payable on March 16, 2009 to Unitholders of
record at the close of business on February 27, 2009. The ex-distribution date
is February 25, 2009. Advantage has approximately 143.8 million Units
outstanding.
	    The Cdn $0.04 per Unit is equivalent to approximately US $0.03 per Unit
if converted using a Canadian/US dollar exchange rate of 1.25. The US dollar
equivalent distribution will be based upon the actual Canadian/US exchange
rate applied on the payment date and will be net of any Canadian withholding
taxes that may apply.
