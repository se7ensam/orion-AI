 Resolutions of the AGM  Jan J. Nooitgedagt
has officially been appointed as a member of the Executive Board of AEGON N.V. following the Group’s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), held today in The Hague. Mr. Nooitgedagt succeeds Joseph B.M. Streppel as chief financial
officer effective immediately. Mr. Streppel announced last January his intention to retire after more than 35 years with AEGON, and as CFO for the past ten years.  “I am pleased and honored to be joining AEGON as chief financial officer and a member of the Executive Board. While these are indeed challenging times for the global insurance industry and financial sector in
general, I look forward to working closely with Alex Wynaendts to position AEGON for the opportunities that lie ahead, building on the solid foundation which has been established in recent years”, said Jan Nooitgedagt.  Alex Wynaendts comments on financial turmoil  “During 2008, we
took decisive steps to strengthen AEGON’s position in the financial crisis which continues to threaten market and consumer confidence. We are confident that our actions to enhance AEGON’s capital position, reduce costs, and put into place
sufficient contingencies to withstand further market distress are the right ones to deal with the adverse effects we have experienced. There can be no question about AEGON’s ability to fulfill its long-term obligations to its customers.
Moreover, we are committed to returning to an era of growth and value creation for our shareholders as market conditions normalize.”  Dudley
Eustace reappointed to the Supervisory Board until 2010  As announced earlier, given the recent changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board, it
was deemed prudent to request Dudley Eustace to remain on as Chairman for an additional year, beyond his term which expires this year in order to ensure continuity. Mr. Eustace has agreed to this request. As such, a resolution has been put to
shareholders for their approval at today’s AGM to reappoint Mr. Eustace to the Supervisory Board for one year. Rob Routs will succeed Mr. Eustace as Chairman of the Supervisory Board at the AGM in April 2010.  Dividend 2008  As part of broader measures to preserve capital in
light of the global financial crisis, AEGON decided to make no final dividend payment on its common shares. In September 2008, AEGON paid an interim dividend of EUR 0.30 a share.
