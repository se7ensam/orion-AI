AirMedia Announces Unaudited Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results



Beijing, China — November 10, 2009 — AirMedia Group Inc. (“AirMedia” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:
AMCN), a leading operator of out-of-home advertising platforms in China targeting mid-to-high-end
consumers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September
30, 2009.


Third Quarter 2009 Financial and Business Highlights






     
    •
     
    Total revenues increased by 11.9% year-over-year to US$37.7 million.



     
 
     
    •
     
    Net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders was US$9.6 million. Basic and diluted
loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) were
both US$0.15.



     
 
     
    •
     
    Adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP), which is net loss
attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and
amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$7.0 million. Adjusted basic and diluted
net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) were both US$0.11.





“We achieved continued revenue growth during the third quarter with higher quarter-over-quarter
utilization rates for most of our product lines, which reflected improving demands from
advertisers,” said Herman Guo, chairman and chief executive officer of AirMedia. “We also made
several achievements on media expansion during the quarter. With the commencement of operations of
several new product lines in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou airports, we significantly enhanced
our media presence in the top four airports in China, which we believe has prepared us well to meet
the increasing demands from advertisers resulting from continuously improving economic conditions
and the upcoming World EXPO 2010 in Shanghai, China.”


Conor Yang, AirMedia’s chief financial officer, added, “During the third quarter, the newly
acquired traditional media spaces in Beijing and Shenzhen airports ramped up in revenues. We were
also able to lower concession fees in four airports. Following upon our recent strategic
expansions, we will continue to focus on revenue growth and concession fee management in the next
few quarters.”

Total revenues for the third quarter of 2009 reached US$37.7 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 11.9% from US$33.7 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 2.5% from US$36.8
million. The year-over-year increase was due to increases in revenues from digital frames in
airports and traditional media in airports. The quarter-over-quarter increase was due to increases
in revenues from digital frames in airports, traditional media in airports and digital TV screens
on airplanes.


Revenues from digital frames in airports



Revenues from digital frames in airports for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 68.7%
year-over-year and by 3.6% quarter-over-quarter to US$17.1 million. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter increases were due to an increase in the number of time slots sold, partially
offset by a decrease in the average advertising revenue per time slot sold (or the “ASP”). Please
refer to “Summary of Selected Operating Data” below for detailed definitions of the operating data
cited in this press release.


The number of time slots sold for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 146.8% year-over-year and
by 44.1% quarter-over-quarter to 8,187 time slots. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter
increases were due to continued sales efforts and growing acceptance of AirMedia’s digital frames.
AirMedia’s digital frames were operated in 31 airports in the third quarter of 2009, up from 19
airports at the end of the third quarter of 2008, and up from 28 airports at the end of the second
quarter of 2009. The number of time slots available for sale for the third quarter of 2009
increased by 69.2% year-over-year and by 10.1% quarter-over-quarter to 28,918 time slots. The
year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of airports in AirMedia’s
digital frame network. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the commencement of
operations of digital frames in three additional airports during the third quarter of 2009, the
full-quarter operations of the digital frames in three airports, which AirMedia commenced to
operate in the middle of the previous quarter, the commencement of operations of mega-size LED
screens and 108-inch stand-alone digital frames, two new product lines, in Guangzhou airport, and
the commencement of operations of stand-alone digital frames in Hangzhou airport. The utilization
rate of digital frames for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 8.9 percentage points
year-over-year and 6.7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 28.3%, primarily due to the
increase in the number of time slots sold.


The ASP of digital frames for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 31.6% year-over-year and by
28.1% quarter-over-quarter to US$2,084. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were
primarily due to higher discounts offered in the third quarter of 2009 than in the same period one
year ago and in the previous quarter.


Revenues from digital TV screens in airports



Revenues from digital TV screens in airports for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 35.7%
year-over-year and by 7.7% quarter-over-quarter to US$8.4 million, primarily due to decreases in
both the number of time slots sold and the ASP of digital TV screens in airports.


The number of time slots sold for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 29.4% year-over-year and
by 3.4% quarter-over-quarter to 5,659 time slots. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to
the still weak, albeit improving, economic conditions. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was
because advertisers shifted their budget allocations from our digital TV screens in airports to our
digital frames in airports as a result of higher discounts offered by us for digital frames. The
number of time slots available for sale for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 1.4%
year-over-year and by 1.1% quarter-over-quarter to 25,629 time slots. The utilization rate for the
third quarter of 2009 decreased by 9.6 percentage points year-over-year and by 1.0 percentage point
quarter-over-quarter to 22.1%, primarily due to the decrease in the number of time slots sold.


The ASP of digital TV screens in airports for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 8.8%
year-over-year and by 4.5% quarter-over-quarter to US$1,487, primarily due to higher discounts
offered in the third quarter of 2009 than in the same period one year ago and in the previous
quarter.

Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes



Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 38.5%
year-over-year and increased by 3.1% quarter-over-quarter to US$4.1 million. The year-over-year
decrease was due to decreases in both the number of time slots sold and the ASP of digital TV
screens on airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to an increase in the
number of time slots sold.


The number of time slots sold for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 25.8% year-over-year and
increased by 13.9% quarter-over-quarter to 213 time slots. The year-over-year decrease was
primarily because the number of time slots sold on airplanes in the third quarter of 2008 was
higher than normal due to Olympic Games. The number of time slots available for sale for the third
quarter of 2009 decreased by 3.8% year-over-year and by 3.8% quarter-over-quarter to 450 time
slots. The utilization rate for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 14.0 percentage points
year-over-year and increased by 7.4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 47.3%. The
year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of time slots sold. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of time slots sold.


The ASP of digital TV screens on airplanes for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 17.0%
year-over-year and by 9.5% quarter-over-quarter to US$19,028. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter decreases in the ASP were due to higher discounts offered in the third quarter
of 2009 than in the same period one year ago and in the previous quarter, as well as the change in
the mix of the time slots sold. The number of time slots sold on the three largest airlines, which
have significantly higher ASPs than those sold on the other airlines, accounted for a lower
percentage in the third quarter of 2009 than in the same period one year ago and in the previous
quarter.


Revenues from traditional media in airports



Please note that part of the prior comparative figure of “Other Displays” has been reclassified to
“Traditional Media in Airports” to conform to the current presentation.


Revenues from traditional media in airports for the third quarter of 2009 primarily included
revenues from traditional media in Beijing Capital International Airport, Shenzhen International
Airport and Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport, as well as revenues from billboards and painted
advertisements on gate bridges in airports. Revenues from traditional media in airports for the
third quarter of 2009 increased by 269.8% year-over-year and by 28.6% quarter-over-quarter to
US$7.3 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the commencement of operations of
traditional media in Beijing and Shenzhen airports in April 2009 and the commencement of operations
in Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport in November 2008. The quarter-over-quarter increase was
primarily due to improved sales of traditional media in Beijing and
Shenzhen airports.


The number of locations sold for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 14.7% quarter-over-quarter
to 359 locations due to increased sales of traditional media in Beijing and Shenzhen airports. The
number of locations available for sale for the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 8.5%
quarter-over-quarter to 1,006 locations due to the upgrade of TV-attached light boxes, which are
classified as traditional media, to TV-attached digital frames, which are classified as digital
frames, in certain airports. The utilization rate of traditional media for the third quarter of
2009 increased by 7.2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 35.7% primarily due to the increase
in the number of locations sold and the decrease in the number of locations available for sale.

 

3




 



The ASP of traditional media in airports for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 12.0%
quarter-over-quarter to US$20,344 due to the change in the mix of the number of locations sold. The
number of traditional media sold in Beijing and Shenzhen airports, which have higher ASPs,
accounted for a higher percentage in the third quarter of 2009 than in the previous quarter.


Please refer to “Summary of Selected Operating Data” for more operating data.


Business tax and other sales tax for the third quarter of 2009 was US$552,000, representing a
year-over-year decrease of 59.8% from US$1.4 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 5.3%
from US$524,000.


Net revenues for the third quarter of 2009 reached US$37.2 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 15.0% from US$32.3 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 2.4% from US$36.3
million.


Cost of Revenues



Cost of revenues for the third quarter of 2009 was US$37.8 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 84.4% from US$20.5 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 2.8% from US$36.8
million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in concession fees in
connection with the expansion of AirMedia’s business. The quarter-over-quarter increase was
primarily due to a one-time cost resulting from disposal of fixed assets. Cost of revenues as a
percentage of net revenues in the third quarter of 2009 was 101.7%, compared to 63.4% in the same
period one year ago and 101.3% in the previous quarter.


AirMedia incurs concession fees to airports for placing and operating digital TV screens, digital
frames, traditional media in airports and other displays, and to airlines for placing programs on
their digital TV screens. Most of the concession fees are fixed with an annual escalation. The
total concession fee under each concession rights contract is charged to the consolidated
statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the agreement periods, which are generally
between three and five years. Concession fees for the third quarter of 2009 were US$27.9 million,
representing a year-over-year increase of 95.5% from US$14.3 million, primarily due to newly
entered or renewed concession rights contracts during the period, and a quarter-over-quarter
decrease of 0.5% from US$28.1 million, primarily due to a reduction of concession fees in four
airports effective in July and August 2009, respectively, partially offset by concession fees
associated with new concession rights contracts in the third quarter of 2009. Concession fees as a
percentage of net revenues in the third quarter of 2009 was 75.1%, compared to 44.2% in the same
period one year ago and 77.3% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase of concession
fees as a percentage of net revenues was primarily because incremental concession fees associated
with new concession rights contracts were fixed once concession rights contracts were entered into
while revenues generated from newly signed concession rights contracts would take time to ramp up.


Gross Profit/Loss 



Gross loss for the third quarter of 2009 was US$628,000, compared to gross profit of US$11.8
million in the same period one year ago and gross loss of US$488,000 in the previous quarter.


Gross loss as a percentage of net revenues for the third quarter of 2009 was negative 1.7%,
compared to gross income as a percentage of net revenues of 36.6% in the same period one year ago
and negative 1.3% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit as a
percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the increase in concession fees.

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were US$10.6 million, representing a
year-over-year increase of 86.8% from US$5.7 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 34.4%
from US$7.9 million.


Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2009 included share-based compensation expenses
of US$1.7 million, compared to share-based compensation expenses of US$1.0 million in the same
period one year ago and US$1.0 million in the previous quarter. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter increases in share-based compensation expense were due to a new grant of
options to purchase 5,434,500 ordinary shares on July 10, 2009, which increased share-based
compensation expenses by US$533,000 in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted operating expenses
(non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2009, which excluded share-based compensation expenses and
amortization of acquired intangible assets, were US$8.1 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 89.3% from US$4.3 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 28.1% from US$6.3
million. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues (non-GAAP) in the third
quarter of 2009 was 21.7%, compared to 13.2% in the same period one year ago and 17.4% in the
previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table for a reconciliation of operating expenses under U.S. GAAP to
adjusted operating expenses (non-GAAP).


Selling and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were US$3.6 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$499,000, representing a year-over-year increase of 58.5%
from US$2.3 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 31.6% from US$2.7 million. The
year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to expansion of the direct
sales force, increased share-based compensation expenses and higher marketing and
promotion expenses. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to higher expenses related
to the expansion of the direct sales force for the new advertising network in Sinopec’s gas
stations and increased share-based compensation expenses.


General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were US$7.0 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$1.2 million, representing a year-over-year increase of
105.7% from US$3.4 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 35.8% from US$5.2 million. The
year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher bad-debt provisions, increased share-based
compensation expenses, higher amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased professional
expenses, headcount increase and increased expenses of office and utilities. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to higher bad-debt provisions, increased
share-based compensation expenses, higher amortization of acquired intangible assets, headcount
increase and increase in other various expenses for the expansion of the new advertising network in
Sinopec’s gas stations.


Income/Loss from Operations



Loss from operations for the third quarter of 2009 was US$11.3 million, as compared to income from
operations of US$6.1 million in the same period one year ago and loss from operations of US$8.4
million in the previous quarter.

Adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2009, which excluded share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$8.7 million, compared
to adjusted income from operations (non-GAAP) of US$7.6 million in the same period one year ago and
adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) of US$6.8 million in the previous quarter. Adjusted
operating margin (non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2009, which excluded the effect of share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was negative 23.4%, compared
to 23.4% in the same period one year ago and negative 18.7% in the previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table for a reconciliation of income/loss from operations under U.S.
GAAP to adjusted income/loss from operations (non-GAAP).


Income Tax Benefit/Expense



Income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2009 was US$875,000 compared to income tax expense of
US$6,000 in the same period one year ago and income tax benefit of US$653,000 in the previous
quarter. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2009 was 8.5%, compared to 0.1% in
the same period one year ago and 8.5% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase in the
effective income tax rate was primarily due to the cessation of tax exemption period for one of our
most profitable subsidiaries, which ended in fiscal year 2008.

Net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders for the third quarter of 2009 was US$9.6 million,
compared to net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$7.5 million in the same period
one year ago and net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$7.0 million in the previous
quarter. The basic net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS for the third quarter
of 2009 was US$0.15, compared to basic net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS
of US$0.11 in the same period one year ago and basic net loss attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders per ADS of US$0.11 in the previous quarter. The diluted net loss attributable to
AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS for the third quarter of 2009 was US$0.15 compared to diluted net
income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.11 in the same period one year ago
and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.11 in the previous
quarter.

one year ago and adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) of US$5.4
million in the previous quarter. Basic adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders

Cash, Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments



AirMedia continued to maintain a strong balance sheet. Excluding restricted cash of US$2.6 million,
Cash and short-term investments totaled US$117.3 million as of September 30, 2009, compared to
US$118.9 million as of June 30, 2009, and US$161.5 million as of December 31, 2008.


ADS Repurchases



On December 29, 2008, AirMedia’s board of directors authorized AirMedia to repurchase up to US$50
million worth of its own outstanding ADSs throughout 2009. AirMedia did not make any repurchases in
the third quarter of 2009. As of November 10, 2009, the aggregate number of ADSs AirMedia has
repurchased on the open market is still 1,646,502 ADSs, the same as the number disclosed in the
first quarter 2009 earnings release.


Other Recent Developments



As of November 9, 2009, AirMedia had installed its media, including scrolling light boxes and
billboards, in 191 Sinopec’s gas stations in Beijing, in 112 Sinopec’s gas stations in Shanghai,
and in 76 Sinopec’s gas stations in Shenzhen. AirMedia will start to put clients’ advertisements on
a trial basis in late November 2009.


AirMedia installed 177 TV-attached digital frames, 21 stand-alone digital frames, 31 digital frames
at the check-in counters and 20 digital frames at the baggage claim areas in Chengdu Shuangliu
Airport, which was rated the 6th largest airport in mainland China in terms of the number of air
passengers. On September 30, 2009, AirMedia commenced operations of most of these newly installed
digital frames, which expanded AirMedia’s digital frame network to 31 airports including all of the
15 largest airports in China.


On September 21, 2009, AirMedia commenced operations of 12 newly installed 108-inch stand-alone
digital frames in Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Prior to this, AirMedia had already been
operating TV-attached digital frames, multiple-screen digital frames and mega-size LED screens in
the Guangzhou airport.


On September 9, 2009, AirMedia commenced operations of 66 newly installed 108-inch or 70-inch
digital frames at the baggage claim areas of all of the three terminals at Beijing Capital
International Airport. Previously, AirMedia had only operated digital frames at the departure areas
of Terminals 2 and 3. These new digital frames significantly enhanced AirMedia’s digital frame
presence at the arrival areas to meet advertisers’ strong demand for advertisements in Beijing
Capital International Airport.


In August 2009, AirMedia entered into a concession rights contract with JCDecaux Momentum Shanghai
Airport Advertising Co., Ltd. to exclusively operate digital TV screens and digital frames in
Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport from September 1,
2009 to February 15, 2012. The expiration date of AirMedia’s original concession rights to operate
digital TV screens at Terminal 1 of the Pudong airport and Terminal 1 of the Hongqiao airport was
also extended from September 19, 2010 to February 15, 2012.


On August 1, 2009, AirMedia commenced operations of three mega-size LED screens, each measuring 76
square meters (or 818.38 square feet), above all of the domestic security check areas in Guangzhou
Baiyun International Airport.

On July 17, 2009, AirMedia commenced operations of stand-alone digital frames in Hangzhou Xiaoshan
Airport. Previously, AirMedia only operated TV-attached digital frames in the Hangzhou airport.


Business Outlook 



AirMedia currently expects that its total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 will be in an
amount ranging from US$44.0 million to US$46.0 million, representing a year-over-year increase of
8.7% to 13.7% from the same period in 2008, and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 16.6% to 21.9%
from the previous quarter.


AirMedia currently expects that concession fees will be at least US$33.3 million in the fourth
quarter of 2009. The anticipated quarter-over-quarter increase in concession fees is primarily due
to the full quarter operation of digital media in the two airports in Shanghai, digital frames in
the Beijing airport, concession fees of outdoor advertising platform in Sinopec’s gas stations, and
other concession rights contracts expected to be entered into soon.


The above forecast reflects AirMedia’s current and preliminary view and is therefore subject to
change. Please refer to our Safe Harbor Statement for the factors which could cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

    Notes:


 


    (1)
     
    We define a time slot as a 30-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital TV screens in
airports and digital TV screens on airplanes, which is shown during each advertising cycle on a
weekly basis in a given airport or on a monthly basis on the routes of a given airline,
respectively. Our airport advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a given
week in one-hour cycles and each hour of programming includes 25 minutes of advertising content,
which allows us to sell a maximum of 50 time slots per week. The number of time slots available for
our digital TV screens in airports during the period presented is calculated by multiplying the
time slots per week per airport by the number of weeks during the period presented when we had
operations in each airport and then calculating the sum of all the time slots available for each of
our network airports. The length of our in-flight programs typically ranges from approximately 45
minutes to an hour per flight, approximately five to 13 minutes of which consist of advertising
content. The number of time slots available for our digital TV screens on airplanes during the
period presented is calculated by multiplying the time slots per airline per month by the number of
months during the period presented when we had operations on each airline and then calculating the
sum of all the time slots for each of our network airlines.


 


    (2)
     
    We define a time slot as a 12-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital frames in
airports, which is shown during each standard advertising cycle on a weekly basis in a given
airport. Our standard airport advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a
given week in 10-minute cycles, which allows us to sell a maximum of 50 time slots per week. The
length of time slot and advertising program cycle of some digital frames in several airports are
different from standard ones. The number of time slots available for our digital frames in airports
during the period presented is calculated by multiplying the time slots per week per airport by the
number of weeks during the period presented when we had operations in each airport and then
calculating the sum of all the time slots available for each of our network airports.


 


    (3)
     
    Number of time slots sold refers to the number of 30-second equivalent advertising time units
for digital TV screens in airports and digital TV screens on airplanes or 12-second equivalent
advertising time units for digital frames in airports sold during the period presented.


 


    (4)
     
    Utilization rate refers to total time slots sold as a percentage of total time slots available
for sale during the relevant period.


 


    (5)
     
    Average advertising revenue per time slot sold for digital TV screens in airports, digital TV
screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports is calculated by dividing our revenues derived
from digital TV screens in airports, digital TV screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports
by its own number of time slots sold, respectively.

    We define the number of locations available for sale in traditional media as the sum of (1) the
number of light boxes and billboards in Beijing, Shenzhen, Wenzhou and certain other airports
(light boxes and billboards), and (2) the number of gate bridges in 10 airports (gate bridges).


 


    (7)
     
    The number of locations sold is defined as the sum of (1) the number of light boxes and
billboards sold and (2) the number of gate bridges sold. To calculate the number of light boxes and
billboards sold in a given airport, we first calculate the “utilization rates of light boxes and
billboards” in such airport by dividing the “total value of light boxes and billboards sold” in
such airport by the “total value of light boxes and billboards” in such airport. The “total value
of light boxes and billboards sold” in a given airport is calculated as the daily listing prices of
each light boxes and billboards sold multiplied by their respective number of days sold during the
period presented. The “total value of light boxes and billboards” in a given airport is calculated
as the sum of quarterly listing prices of all the light boxes and billboards during the period
presented. The number of light boxes and billboards sold in a given airport is then calculated as
the number of light boxes and billboards available for sale in such airport multiplied by the
utilization rates of light boxes and billboards in such airport. The number of gate bridges sold in
a given airport is counted based on the contracts.


 


    (8)
     
    Utilization rate refers to total locations sold as a percentage of total locations available
for sale during the period presented.


 


    (9)
     
    Average advertising revenue per location sold is calculated by dividing the revenues derived
from all the locations sold by the number of locations sold during the period presented.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



AirMedia’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of AirMedia’s
comparative operating performance and future prospects. AirMedia’s non-GAAP financial measures
exclude certain special items, including (1) share-based compensation expenses, and (2)
amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by AirMedia’s
management in their financial and operating decision-making, because management believes they
reflect AirMedia’s ongoing business and operating performance in a manner that allows meaningful
period-to-period comparisons. AirMedia’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures
provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating AirMedia’s
operating performance in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. Specifically,
AirMedia believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and
investors by excluding certain charges that we believe are not indicative of our core operating
results.


The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. They do not include all items of income and
expense that affect AirMedia’s income from operations. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies and, with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude
certain items under GAAP, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer to AirMedia.
Management compensates for these limitations by also considering AirMedia’s financial results as
determined in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to
be considered superior to, in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance
with US GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table
captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Income/(Loss) and EPS and non-GAAP Adjusted Income/(Loss) and
EPS” set forth at the end of this release.

Safe Harbor Statement



This announcement contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“future,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “confident” and similar statements. Among other
things, the Business Outlook section and the quotations from management in this announcement, as
well as AirMedia Group Inc.’s strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements.
AirMedia may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 20-F and 6-K, etc., in its annual report to
shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its
officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts,
including statements about AirMedia’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statement. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: if advertisers or the
viewing public do not accept, or lose interest in, our air travel advertising network, we may be
unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities and our prospects and results
of operations could be negatively affected; we derive substantially all of our revenues from the
provision of air travel advertising services, and recent slowdown in the air travel advertising
industry in China may materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operation; our
strategy of expanding our advertising network by expanding into traditional media and building new
media platforms may not succeed, and our failure to do so could materially reduce the
attractiveness of our network and harm our business, reputation and results of operations; if our
customers reduce their advertising spending due to an economic downturn in China and/or elsewhere
or for any other reason, our revenues and results of operations may be materially and adversely
affected; we face risks related to health epidemics such as the H1N1 flu, which could materially
and adversely affect air travel and result in reduced demand for our advertising services or
disrupt our operations; if we are unable to retain existing concession rights contracts or obtain
new concession rights contracts on commercially advantageous terms that allow us to operate our
advertising platforms, we may be unable to maintain or expand our network coverage and our business
and prospects may be harmed; a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from the five
largest airports and three largest airlines in China, and if any of these airports or airlines
experiences a material business disruption, our ability to generate revenues and our results of
operations would be materially and adversely affected; our limited operating history makes it
difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations; and other risks outlined in
AirMedia’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. AirMedia does not undertake
any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.
