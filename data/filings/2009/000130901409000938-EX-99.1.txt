Third Quarter 2009 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009 were RMB219.6 million (US$32.2
million), an increase of 5.1% from RMB209.0 million for the same quarter in 2008.


Print advertising revenues for the third quarter of 2009 decreased 7.2% to RMB77.1 million (US$11.3
million) compared with RMB83.2 million for the same quarter in 2008. The decrease was primarily
due to a lower volume of print advertising pages in 51job Weekly resulting from a decline in market
demand, which was largely offset by higher average revenue per page. The estimated number of print
advertising pages generated in the third quarter of 2009 decreased 23.6% to 3,213 compared with
4,204 pages in the same quarter in 2008. Although print advertising prices charged in each city
have remained relatively stable, overall average revenue per page increased 21.4% over the third
quarter of 2008 due to an increase in page volume contribution from cities where print advertising
prices are generally higher as compared to the same quarter of the prior year.


Online recruitment services revenues for the third quarter of 2009 were RMB90.1 million (US$13.2
million), representing a 16.0% increase from RMB77.7 million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The increase primarily resulted from a greater number of unique employers using the
Company’s online recruitment services, which was partially offset by lower average revenue per
unique employer. Unique employers increased 47.0% to 91,167 in the third quarter of 2009 compared
with 62,023 in the same quarter of the prior year driven by greater customer acceptance and usage
of online recruitment services. Average revenue per unique employer decreased 21.1% in the third
quarter of 2009 due to employers purchasing lower priced products and/or reducing their overall
spending on online recruitment services as compared to the same quarter in 2008.


Other human resource related revenues for the third quarter of 2009 increased 8.6% to RMB52.4
million (US$7.7 million) from RMB48.2 million in the same quarter of 2008 principally due to
greater customer demand for human resource outsourcing services, which was partially offset by
lower revenues from executive search and training services.


Gross profit for the third quarter of 2009 increased 24.3% to RMB129.7 million (US$19.0 million)
from RMB104.3 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is equal to
gross profit divided by net revenues, expanded to 62.4% in the third quarter of 2009 compared with
52.7% in the same quarter in 2008 primarily due to lower printing related and other direct expenses
resulting from the implementation of cost control and efficiency measures earlier this year.


Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were RMB89.6 million (US$13.1 million) compared
with RMB82.3 million for the same quarter of 2008. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues was 43.1% for the third quarter of 2009 compared with 41.6% for the third quarter of 2008.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues was
40.5% in the third quarter of 2009 compared with 38.9% in the third quarter of 2008.


Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2009 increased 7.5% to RMB53.2 million
(US$7.8 million) from RMB49.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to
increased commissions resulting from higher sales and greater advertising expenses, which were
partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses compared to the same quarter in 2008.


General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2009 increased 11.1% to RMB36.5
million (US$5.3 million) from RMB32.8 million in the third quarter of 2008, which was largely
attributable to higher employee compensation, rental and depreciation expenses incurred in the
third quarter of 2009.


Income from operations for the third quarter of 2009 increased 81.6% to RMB40.1 million (US$5.9
million) from RMB22.1 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Other income in the third
quarter of 2009 included tax subsidies of RMB7.4 million (US$1.1 million) compared with RMB2.9
million in the same quarter of the prior year. The Company’s effective tax rate was 30.1% in the
third quarter of 2009 compared with 7.4% in the third quarter of 2008, which was lower due to an
adjustment for the cumulative impact of certain tax changes in 2008.


Net income for the third quarter of 2009 increased 27.0% to RMB35.9 million (US$5.3 million) from
RMB28.3 million for the same quarter in 2008. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the
third quarter of 2009 were RMB0.65 (US$0.10) compared with RMB0.50 for the same quarter in 2008.
Fully diluted earnings per ADS for the third quarter of 2009 were RMB1.29 (US$0.19) compared with
RMB1.00 in the third quarter of 2008.


In the third quarter of 2009, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB6.5 million (US$0.9 million), unchanged from the third quarter of 2008. The Company also
recognized a foreign currency translation loss of RMB86,000 (US$13,000) in the third quarter of
2009 compared with a translation loss of RMB1.5 million in the third quarter of 2008.


Excluding share-based compensation expense and the impact of foreign currency translation loss,
non-GAAP adjusted income for the third quarter of 2009 increased 17.0% to RMB42.5 million (US$6.2
million) compared with RMB36.3 million for the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully
diluted earnings per common share were RMB0.77 (US$0.11) in the third quarter of 2009 compared with
RMB0.64 in the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per ADS in the
third quarter of 2009 were RMB1.53 (US$0.22) compared with RMB1.28 in the third quarter of 2008.

million), a decrease of 11.0% from RMB664.2 million in the comparable period in 2008. Income from
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 decreased to RMB78.6 million (US$11.5
million) from RMB90.9 million for the same period last year.


Net income for the first nine months of 2009 decreased to RMB66.1 million (US$9.7 million) from
RMB69.8 million for the same period in 2008. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the first

with RMB2.46 in the same period in 2008.


Excluding share-based compensation and foreign currency translation loss, non-GAAP adjusted net
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 decreased to RMB87.1 million (US$12.8 million)
from RMB108.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully

nine months of 2009 were RMB3.12 (US$0.46) compared with RMB3.81 in the same period in 2008.


In September 2008, the Company announced that its shareholders had approved a share repurchase
program authorizing the repurchase of up to US$25 million worth of outstanding ADSs. In the third
quarter of 2009, the Company repurchased 273,563 ADSs, representing 547,126 common shares, in the
open market for an aggregate consideration of US$3.3 million, including transaction fees. Since
the inception of this share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased a total of 794,605
ADSs, representing 1,589,210 common shares, for an aggregate consideration of US$7.0 million.


As of September 30, 2009, the Company had cash and short-term investments totaling RMB1,173.9
million (US$172.0 million) compared with RMB1, 074.4 million at December 31, 2008. Short-term
investments consist of certificates of deposit held by the Company in banking institutions in
China.


Business Outlook


Based on current market and operating conditions, and taking into consideration that the fourth
quarter is historically a seasonally weak period for recruitment, the Company’s revenue target for
the fourth quarter of 2009 is in the estimated range of RMB215 million to RMB225 million (US$31.5
million to US$33.0 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense and any foreign currency
translation loss or gain, the Company’s non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the fourth
quarter of 2009 is in the estimated range of RMB0.58 to RMB0.68 per common share (US$0.17 to
US$0.20 per ADS). The Company expects aggregate share-based compensation expense in the fourth
quarter of 2009 to be in the estimated range of RMB6 million to RMB7 million (US$0.9 million to
US$1.0 million).


Currency Convenience Translation


For the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars at
the rate of RMB6.8262 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate on September 30, 2009 in New York for cable
transfers of Renminbi per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the
Federal Reserve Board.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of adjusted net
income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from
results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and foreign
currency translation gain or loss. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company’s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company’s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss from its non-GAAP
financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation gain or loss is
unrelated to the Company’s core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor
impact the Company’s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP measures excluding
share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss are important in
helping investors to understand the Company’s current financial performance and future prospects
and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The
presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to
GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The
non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.
