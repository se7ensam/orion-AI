Attached herewith as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release, issued on June 26, 2009,
whereby Acergy S.A. (the "Company") announced today that an Extraordinary
Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") will take place at the offices of SGG
S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg on August 4, 2009 at 2 p.m. local
time for the purpose of considering resolutions 9 and 10 of the Annual General
Meeting Agenda.

It was noted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 22, 2009 that
the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for resolutions 9 and 10
was not present and this meeting was therefore not able to consider these
resolutions.

The Board of Directors therefore decided to call an Extraordinary General
Meeting to consider resolutions 9 and 10. At this Meeting there is no
requirement for quorum. However, to approve the proposed resolutions a 2/3rd
majority of the votes cast at the Meeting will be required.

Proxies already received for the May 22, 2009 Annual General Meeting remain
valid for this Meeting and Shareholders of record as of Tuesday, March 31, 2009
are entitled to vote at the Meeting. Those Shareholders who have not yet cast
their votes may do so by submitting the already distributed proxy card as
instructed, or alternatively to attend the Meeting in Luxembourg at the above
address. The new deadline for submission of votes for American Depositary
Receipt holders is July 22, 2009 and for holders of Common Shares July 24, 2009.

The Board expects to call an Extraordinary General Meeting later in the year to
consider a proposal for updated Articles of Incorporation and a new Long-Term
Incentive Plan. In addition, the Board expects to propose additional directors.

The Board's Governance and Nomination Committee process of identifying and
communicating with potential additional directors is progressing well.

Attached herewith as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6 and 99.7,
respectively, are the following materials regarding the Meeting:

   1.    Chairman's letter dated June 26, 2009 inter alia advising of the
         Meeting.

   2.    Notice of the Meeting on August 4, 2009.

   3.    Letter from DnB NOR Bank ASA to Shareholders of the Company regarding

         Meeting of Acergy S.A.

The above materials were mailed on June 26, 2009 by Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas to all holders of American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (each of which
represents one Common Share of the Company) of record as of March 31, 2009.

competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship
with significant clients; the outcome of legal proceedings or governmental
enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely
delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion
programs; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including
spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to
control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on
the forward-looking statements.

Dear Shareholder,

An Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") of Acergy S.A.
(the "Company") will be held on Tuesday August 4, 2009 at 2.00 p.m. (local time)
at the offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg.

Due to the fact that the Company is incorporated in Luxembourg as a societe
anonyme holding, the Company's affairs are governed by the provisions of
Luxembourg Company Law. Under these provisions and the provisions of the
Company's Articles of Incorporation, an Extraordinary General Meeting relates to
and considers matters of a more formal nature. The matters to be addressed at
the Meeting are restricted to those in the Notice.

It was noted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 22, 2009 that
the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for resolutions 9 and 10
was not present and this meeting was therefore not able to consider these
resolutions.

The Board of Directors therefore decided to call the Meeting to consider
resolutions 9 and 10. At this Meeting there is no requirement for quorum.
However, to approve the proposed resolutions a 2/3rd majority of the votes cast
at the Meeting will be required.

In relation to these two resolutions, our letter of April 2, 2009 to the
Shareholders provided some more clarity as follows:

"Background
The current authorised share capital of the Company is comprised of 230,000,000
common shares. The issued share capital is comprised of 194,953,972 issued
shares as at November 30, 209.

According to the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Luxembourg law, the
existing shareholders have a pre-emptive right to subscribe for new issued
shares. On May 27, 2004 the shareholders provided the Board with an authority
expiring on August 17, 2009 to issue new shares within the limit of the
230,000,000 authorised share capital and not offer such shares to existing
shareholders on a pre-emptive basis.

412F, Route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg
Societe Anonyme Holding, R.C. Luxembourg B 43172
                                                                     Page 1 of 3

                                                        [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Acergy

The maximum number of shares that may be acquired by the Company is determined
by Article 49-2 of the Luxembourg law as 10% of the issued share capital. At
present 12,137,879 shares have been acquired by Acergy S.A. and indirectly by a
wholly-owned subsidiary and these shares are currently retained as treasury
shares. These treasury shares represent 6.23% of the number of issued shares.

Obligation for Acergy to deliver shares
Acergy has - at present - potential obligation to deliver 25,307,333 shares or
approximately 13.0% of the issued share capital. This share obligation
corresponds to:

     a)    20,790,021 shares under the terms of the 2.25% Convertible Bond
           due 2013

     b)    4,517,312 shares under previously approved option schemes.

Convertible Bond obligations and share option exercises can be satisfied by
either issuing new shares or delivering treasury shares.

Proposal for Shareholders Approval

a) Item 9 (authorised share capital)
The Board is seeking shareholder approval to renew - for a further five year
period - the authority for the Board to issue new shares within the limit of the
230,000,000 authorised share capital and not offer such shares to existing
shareholders on a pre-emptive basis. If approved, this would retain the ability
to meet the current obligations under the Convertible Bond and share option
schemes. Renewal of the authority requires a change to the Articles of
Incorporation as laid out in item 9.

b) Item 10 (authority to cancel shares)
The Board is seeking approval to have the flexibility to cancel existing
treasury shares. Furthermore, the Board is also seeking approval to renew - for
a period of one year - its existing authority to extend the share buyback
programme by allowing the Company to acquire a higher number of issued shares
than the number which can be acquired at present.

Note: Under Luxembourg Law, the Company, having bought back 10% of its shares
following an Annual General Meeting of Shareholders authorising such buyback,

                                                                     Page 2 of 3

                                                        [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Acergy

cannot cancel such shares and continue buying back shares without a new
authorisation from its shareholders to buyback shares."

Proxies already received for the May 22, 2009 Annual General Meeting remain
valid for this Meeting and Shareholders of record as of Tuesday March 31, 2009
are entitled to vote at the Meeting. Those Shareholders who have not yet cast
their votes may do so by submitting the enclosed Proxy Card as instructed, or
alternatively attend the Meeting in Luxembourg at the above address. The new
deadline for submission of votes for American Depositary Receipt holders is July
22, 2009 and for holders of Common Shares July 24, 2009.

Enclosed with this mailing is the Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders and the Proxy Card.

If you require further information or clarification on any issues please contact
our General Counsel at johan.rasmussen@acergy-group.com.

The Company's Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favour of the
proposals to be considered at the Meeting.

Yours sincerely


Sir Peter Mason K.B.E.
Chairman

ADR Record Date:    March 31, 2009

Common: ADR ratio   1 Common Share: 1 ADR

In accordance with Section 17 of the Deposit Agreement between Acergy S.A. (the
"Company") and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Depositary (the
"Depositary"), Acergy S.A. ADR holders (the "Holders") are hereby notified of
the Company's Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. A copy of the
Notice of Meeting from the Company, which includes the agenda for such meeting,
is enclosed.

It was noted by the Company at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May
22, 2009 that the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for
resolutions 9 and 10 was not present and the Meeting of Shareholders was
therefore not able to consider these resolutions. The Board of Directors of the
Company therefore decided to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders to consider resolutions 9 and 10. At this Meeting there is no
requirement for quorum. However, to approve the proposed resolutions a 2/3(rd)
majority of the votes cast at the Meeting will be required.

Proxies already received for the initial meeting remain valid for this Meeting
and Holders at the close of business on the ADR record date will be entitled,
subject to any applicable law, the Company's Articles of Association and the
provisions of or governing Deposited Property underlying ADRs, to instruct the
Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any, pertaining to the
Shares or other Deposited Property represented by ADRs. Those Holders who have
not previously issued a proxy for that purpose can use the enclosed voting
instruction form.

Upon receipt of a voting instruction from an ADR Holder on the ADR record date,
received on or before the ADR voting deadline, the Depositary shall endeavor,
insofar as practicable and permitted under applicable law, the provisions of the
Articles of Association of the Company and the provisions of the Deposited
Property underlying the ADRs, to vote or cause the Custodian to vote the Shares
and/or other Deposited Property, in person or by proxy, represented by the ADRs
in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request.

Voting instructions may be given only in respect of a number of ADRs
representing an integral number of Shares or other Deposited Property.

Neither the Depositary nor the Custodian shall under any circumstances exercise
any discretion as to voting and neither the Depositary nor the Custodian shall
vote or attempt to exercise the right to vote Shares or other Deposited Property
represented by ADRs except pursuant to and in accordance with such written
instructions from Holders. Shares or other Deposited Property represented by
ADRs for which no specific voting instructions are received by the Depositary
from the Holder shall not be voted.

In the event of a postponement of the Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders, all votes received from beneficial holders of Acergy S.A. ADRs
will remain valid for the purposes of any such postponed General Meeting.
