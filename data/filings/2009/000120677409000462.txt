<P align=justify><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>BASIS OF PRESENTATION
</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The information below should be
read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the
year ended December 31, 2008. Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles
(&#147;GAAP&#148;). The effect of significant differences between Canadian and U.S. GAAP
has been disclosed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2008. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
references to &#147;Ballard&#148;, &#147;the Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; and &#147;our&#148; refer to Ballard
Power Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis is dated
March 2, 2009.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>All amounts in this report are in
U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS</FONT></B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2> </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>This document contains
forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management and
reflect our current expectations as contemplated under the safe harbor
provisions of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended</FONT><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>. </FONT></B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Such statements include, but are not limited to,
statements with respect to our objectives, goals and outlook including our
estimated product shipments, revenue and operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures), as well as statements with respect to our beliefs, plans,
objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions. Words such as
"estimate", "project", "believe", "anticipate", "intend", "expect", "plan",
"predict", "may", "should", "will", the negatives of these words or other
variations thereof and comparable terminology are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are difficult
to predict.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>In particular, these
forward-looking statements are based on certain specific assumptions relating to
our expectations with respect to the generation of new sales, producing,
delivering and selling the expected product volumes at the expected prices, and
controlling our costs. They are also based on a variety of general factors and
assumptions including, but not limited to, our expectations regarding product
development efforts, manufacturing capacity, product pricing, market demand, and
the availability and prices of raw materials, labour and supplies. These
assumptions have been derived from information available to the Company
including information obtained by the Company from third parties. These
assumptions may prove to be incorrect in whole or in part. In addition, actual
results may differ materially from those expressed, implied, or forecasted in
such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from the results expressed, implied or forecasted
in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the
condition of the global economy; the rate of mass adoption of our products;
changes in product pricing; changes in our customers' requirements, the
competitive environment and related market conditions; product development
delays; changes in the availability or price of raw materials, labour and
supplies; our ability to attract and retain business partners, suppliers,
employees and customers; changing environmental regulations; our access to
funding and our ability to provide the capital required for product development,
operations and marketing efforts; our ability to protect our intellectual
property; the magnitude of the rate of change of the Canadian dollar versus the
U.S. dollar; and the general assumption that none of the risks identified in the
Risks and Uncertainties section of this report or in our most recent Annual
Information Form will materialize. Readers should not place undue reliance on
Ballard's forward-looking statements.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The forward-looking statements
contained in this document speak only as of the date of this Management
Discussion and Analysis. Except as required by applicable legislation, Ballard
does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this Management Discussion and Analysis, including the occurrence of
unanticipated events.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>BUSINESS OVERVIEW
</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>At Ballard, we are building a
clean energy growth company. We are recognized as a world leader in proton
exchange membrane (&#147;PEM&#148;) fuel cell development and commercialization. Our
principal business is the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of
fuel cell products for a variety of applications, focusing on motive power
(material handling and buses) and stationary power (back-up power and
residential cogeneration).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>A fuel cell is an environmentally
clean electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen (from the
air) to produce electricity. The hydrogen fuel can be obtained from natural gas,
kerosene, methanol or other hydrocarbon fuels, or from water through
electrolysis. As long as fuel is supplied, the fuel cell produces electricity
efficiently and continuously without combustion, with water and heat as the main
byproducts when hydrogen is used as the fuel source.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Ballard&#174; fuel cell products
feature high fuel efficiency, low operating temperature, low noise and
vibration, compact size, quick response to changes in electrical demand, modular
design and environmental cleanliness. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Over the past three years, the
Company implemented a strategy to focus on key growth opportunities with
near-term commercial prospects. We sold our automotive fuel cell systems
operations to DaimlerChrysler AG (&#147;Daimler&#148;) and Ford Motor Company (&#147;Ford&#148;) on
August 31, 2005. We subsequently sold our electric drive operations to Siemens
VDO Automotive Corporation ("Siemens VDO") on February 15, 2007. Finally, we
completed our exit from the fuel cell car business by selling our automotive
fuel cell research and development assets to Daimler, Ford and a newly created
private corporation, AFCC Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. (&#147;AFCC&#148;). We
completed this transaction (the &#147;AFCC Transaction&#148;) on January 31, 2008, we
completed the AFCC Agreement and recorded a gain of $96.8 million. Under the
terms of the AFCC Transaction, we transferred to Daimler, Ford and AFCC our
automotive patents, automotive fuel cell test equipment, automotive fuel cell
inventory, $60 million in cash, all automotive fuel cell warranty liabilities
and automotive fuel cell development contracts between Ballard, Daimler and
Ford, 80.1% of the outstanding shares of AFCC, 112 personnel, and a royalty
free, sub-licensable license to the remaining Ballard intellectual property for
use in automotive applications. In exchange, Daimler and Ford returned to us an
aggregate of 34,261,298 of our common shares valued at $173.9 million, one Class
A share and one Class B share, collectively representing Daimler and Ford&#146;s
entire direct and indirect equity interest in Ballard. These shares were then
cancelled. In accordance with GAAP, the operations of our automotive segment
disposed of in the AFCC Transaction have not been presented as discontinued
operations due to our continuing relationship with AFCC and the provision of
product and services subsequent to the sale of the automotive assets. As a
result, comparative figures have not been restated. See note 3 to our
consolidated financial statements. After the closing of the AFCC Transaction,
our automotive segment&#146;s focus is on fuel cell buses and contract technical and
manufacturing services.</FONT></P>
<HR align=center width="100%" noShade SIZE=2>
<PAGE>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Following completion of these
dispositions, we identified a way to extract value from our tax attributes in
2008 through a restructuring transaction with Superior Plus Income Fund
("Superior Plus") resulting in a non-dilutive financing with net cash proceeds
of $33.8 million (Canadian $41.2 million). Pursuant to this corporate
reorganization, completed on December 31, 2008 under a Plan of Arrangement
(&#147;Arrangement&#148;), Superior Plus transferred $38.0 million (Canadian $46.3
million) to us. We subsequently transferred all of our assets and liabilities
(including the net cash proceeds from this Arrangement of $33.8 million, but
excluding our historic Canadian income tax carry forward attributes), to the
Company. Ballard shareholders exchanged their old shares, on a one-for-one
basis, for shares of the Company. The Company will now carry on the full scope
of our business of the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of
hydrogen fuel cells for a variety of applications and will hold all rights to
intellectual property as we held prior to the completion of the Arrangement. As
part of the Arrangement, Superior Plus&#146; unitholders obtained new shares of the
old Ballard entity. That entity will retain Ballard&#146;s historic Canadian income
tax carry forward attributes.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>As the transfer of the business
assets, liabilities and operations from old Ballard to the Company represented a
transaction with no change in shareholder ownership, the transaction was
accounted for using continuity of interest accounting. Pursuant to continuity of
interest accounting, the assets transferred and liabilities assumed were
recorded at their carrying values as reported by old Ballard immediately prior
to the completion of the Arrangement. As a result, the net cash proceeds of
$33.8 million (Canadian $41.2 million) were recorded as a credit to
shareholders&#146; equity. In addition, as the future income tax benefits of old
Ballard&#146;s Canadian non-capital losses, capital losses, scientific research and
development expenditures and investment tax credits generated through to the
date of the completion of the Arrangement are not available to the Company after
the completion of the Arrangement, the gross future income tax assets related to
these Canadian tax pools was reduced to nil, with a corresponding reduction of
the related valuation allowance. Details of the Arrangement are described more
fully in our Management Information Circular dated November 14, 2008. See also
note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We are based in Canada, with head
office, research and development, testing and manufacturing facilities in
Burnaby, British Columbia. In addition, we have sales, research and development
and manufacturing facilities in Lowell, Massachusetts. We also participate in a
joint venture, EBARA BALLARD Corporation (&#147;EBARA BALLARD&#148;), in Tokyo, Japan that
develops, manufactures and sells fuel cell stationary power products to
customers in Japan.</FONT></P>

declined 9%, or $6.0 million, compared to 2007, product and service revenues
increased 22%, or $9.4 million, due to higher shipments of bus, material
handling, light duty automotive and back-up power fuel cell products and to new
testing and engineering services to AFCC which were only partially offset by
lower shipments of residential cogeneration and carbon fiber products.
Engineering development revenue declined $15.3 million primarily as a result of

assets of $96.8 million resulting from the AFCC Transaction partially offset by
the write-down of a non-core investment in Chrysalix Energy Limited Partnership

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Our normalized net loss (see

compared with a normalized net loss of $52.2 million, or ($0.46) per share, for
2007. The primary reasons for the $7.7 million higher normalized net loss in
2008 were due to decreases in foreign exchange gains of $12.4 million and
decreases in investment income of $6.2 million. Decreases in product and service
gross margins of $13.0 million and engineering development revenues of $15.3
million were more than offset by decreases in operating expenses of $29.3
million and depreciation and amortization of $9.7 million. Lower gross margins
were driven by larger reductions in warranty provisions in 2007 compared to
2008, combined with reduced field service activities for fuel cell buses and
more aggressive product pricing and enhanced warranty coverage on material
handling products in order to escalate market adoption. This was partially
offset by improved gross margin as a result of new testing and engineering
services provided to AFCC and increased fuel cell bus margins as a result of the
B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program. The decline in operating
expenses was driven by lower research and development expenses on automotive
fuel cell programs as a result of the AFCC Transaction. The increase in
normalized net loss on a per share basis was due primarily to the 30% reduction
in the number of common shares outstanding as a result of the AFCC Transaction.

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>REVENUE RECOGNITION </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We earn revenues under certain
contracts to provide engineering development services. These contracts provide
for the payment for services based on our achieving defined milestones or on the
performance of work under our product development programs. Revenues are
recognized under these contracts based on assessments of progress achieved
against these milestones or on the proportionate performance method of
accounting. There is a risk that a customer may ultimately disagree with our
assessment of the progress achieved against milestones or that our estimates of
the percentage of work completed could change. Should this occur, the revenues
recognized in the period might require adjustment in a subsequent
period.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Under the terms of certain other
contracts under which we earn product and engineering service revenue, revenue
is recognized based on the proportion of performance completed. There is a risk
that estimated costs to complete a contract might change, which may result in an
adjustment to previously recognized revenues. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>During the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007, there were no material adjustments to engineering development
revenue and product and service revenue relating to revenue recognized in a
prior period.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>WARRANTY PROVISION </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>A provision for warranty costs is
recorded on product sales at the time of shipment. In establishing the accrued
warranty liabilities, we estimate the likelihood that products sold will
experience warranty claims and the cost to resolve claims received. In making
such determinations, we use estimates based on the nature of the contract and
past and projected experience with the products. Should these estimates prove to
be incorrect, we may incur costs different from those provided for in our
warranty provisions. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 we
recorded provisions to accrued warranty liabilities of $4.4 million and $0.8
million, respectively, for new product sales.</FONT></P>
<HR align=center width="100%" noShade SIZE=2>
<PAGE>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We review our warranty assumptions
and make adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities quarterly based on the
latest information available and to reflect the expiry of contractual
obligations. Adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities are recorded in cost of
product and service revenues. As a result of these reviews, we recorded
adjustments that reduced accrued warranty liabilities by $0.4 million and $8.9
million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The 2008
adjustments to reduce accrued warranty liabilities were primarily due to
contractual expirations and improved lifetimes of our Power Generation fuel
cells. The 2007 adjustments to reduce accrued warranty liabilities were
primarily due to cost reductions, contractual expirations and improved lifetimes
of our Automotive fuel cells.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>INVENTORY PROVISION </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>In determining the lower of cost
and net realizable value of our inventory and establishing the appropriate
provision for inventory obsolescence, we estimate the likelihood that inventory
carrying values will be affected by changes in market pricing or demand for our
products and by changes in technology or design which could make inventory on
hand obsolete or recoverable at less than cost. We perform regular reviews to
assess the impact of changes in technology and design, sales trends and other
changes on the carrying value of inventory. Where we determine that such changes
have occurred and will have a negative impact on the value of inventory on hand,
appropriate provisions are made. If there is a subsequent increase in the value
of inventory on hand, reversals of previous write-downs to net realizable value
are made. Unforeseen changes in these factors could result in additional
inventory provisions, or reversals of previous provisions, being required.
During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, inventory provisions of
$0.7</FONT><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2> </FONT></B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>million and $1.4 million, respectively, were recorded as a charge to cost
of product and service revenues.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>INVESTMENTS </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We have made strategic investments
in other companies or partnerships that are developing technology with potential
fuel cell applications. Each of these investments is either accounted for by the
equity method or carried at cost, depending on whether or not we have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the company or partnership. We
regularly review such investments and should circumstances indicate that an
impairment of value has occurred that is other than temporary, we would record
this impairment in the earnings of the current period. Given that these entities
are in the development stage, there is significant judgment required in
determining whether an impairment has occurred in the value of these investments
that must be recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a
$3.0 million write-down of our non-core investment in Chrysalix. During the year
ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $4.6 million write-down of our non-core
investment in Advanced Energy to $0.5 million, representing proceeds received of
$0.5 million.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND
GOODWILL</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>In accordance with Canadian GAAP,
we do not amortize goodwill, and we amortize intangible assets over periods
ranging from five to 15 years. At least annually, we review the carrying value
of our intangible assets and goodwill by segment for potential impairment. Among
other things, this review considers the fair value of the business based on
discounted estimated cash flows. If circumstances indicate that impairment in
the value of these assets has occurred, we would record this impairment in the
earnings of the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2008, no
write-downs of intangible assets or goodwill were recorded. During the year
ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $1.4 million charge to amortization
expense for patents no longer in use.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
AND DEVELOPMENTS</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Convergence with International
Financial Reporting Standards </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>In February 2008, Canada&#146;s
Accounting Standards Board (&#147;AcSB&#148;) confirmed that Canadian GAAP, as used by
public companies, will be converged with International Financial Reporting
Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;) effective January 1, 2011. The transition from Canadian GAAP
to IFRS will be applicable for us for the first quarter of 2011 when we will
prepare both the current and comparative financial information using
IFRS.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>While IFRS uses a conceptual
framework similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant differences on
recognition, measurement and disclosures. We commenced our IFRS conversion
project in the second quarter of 2008. The project consists of four phases:
awareness raising; assessment; design; and implementation. With the assistance
of an external expert advisor, we have completed the awareness-raising phase and
have begun a high level review of the major differences between Canadian GAAP
and IFRS (the assessment phase). It is expected that this work will be completed
during 2009. Subsequently, we will initiate the design phase, which will involve
establishing issue-specific work teams to focus on generating options and making
recommendations in identified areas. We will also establish a communications
plan, begin to develop staff training programs, and evaluate the impacts of the
IFRS transition on other business activities. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Capital Disclosures
</FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>In 2008, we adopted the
recommendations of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (&#147;CICA&#148;) for
capital disclosures (CICA Handbook Section 1535). This new section establishes
standards for disclosing information about an entity&#146;s capital and how it is
managed. This standard requires us to disclose (i) our objectives, policies and
processes for managing capital; (ii) summary quantitative data about what we
manage as capital; (iii) whether during the period we complied with any
externally imposed capital requirements to which we are subject; and (iv) if we
have not complied with such requirements, the consequences of such
non-compliance. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Goodwill and Intangible Assets
</FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>In 2008, we elected to early adopt
the new recommendations of the CICA for accounting for &#147;Goodwill and Intangible
Assets&#148; (CICA Handbook Section 3064). This new section will replace the existing
standards for &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (CICA Handbook Section
3062) and &#147;Research and Development Costs&#148; (CICA Handbook Section 3450). The new
standard (i) states that upon their initial identification, intangible assets
are to be recognized as assets only if they meet the definition of an intangible
asset and the recognition criteria; (ii) provides guidance on the recognition of
internally generated intangible assets including research and development costs;
and (iii) carries forward the current requirements of Section 3062 for
subsequent measurement and disclosure of intangible assets and goodwill. As we
have historically expensed all research and development costs as incurred, we
were not materially impacted by the implementation of this new standard for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Power Generation product and
service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined $0.5 million, or
3%, compared to 2007. Increased product shipments and a change in sales mix
towards higher power units in the material handling market combined with higher
shipments in the back-up power market were offset by lower residential
cogeneration market sales and lower non-recurring engineering service revenues
for government contracts in the material handling market. The decline in
residential cogeneration market sales was expected due to the introduction in
2008 of a new lower cost product combined with the delivery of fuel cell MEAs
instead of fuel cell stacks as the fuel cell stacks will be assembled in Japan
by our joint venture, EBARA BALLARD.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Power Generation engineering
development revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced $2.4
million, or 37%, compared to 2007. Revenues are derived from our 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell program and reflect the percentage of completed
performance of our development program for our customer, the related costs of
which were included in research and development expenses. As expected, the
decline is due to the completion at the end of the third quarter of 2008 of our
current agreement with EBARA and EBARA BALLARD for the development of our 1kW
residential cogeneration fuel cell stack. Since 2005, we have recorded $18.0
million of engineering development revenue from EBARA BALLARD, representing the
full amount earned for the performance of work under this development
program.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Automotive product and service
revenues increased $11.2 million, or 69%, for the year ended December 31, 2008,
compared to 2007. Increased automotive service revenues derived from new testing
and engineering services provided to AFCC combined with the commencement of
shipments of fuel cell bus modules related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel
cell bus program (which contributed $6.0 million to revenue in December 2008)
and increased light duty automotive product shipments at lower prices to AFCC
were partially offset by the expected decline in field service revenues for fuel
cell buses due to a lower number of fuel cell buses under service
contracts.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Automotive engineering development
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $13.0 million, or 82%,
compared to 2007. The decline in 2008 is due primarily to the closing of the
AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008 resulting in only one month of automotive
development revenues in 2008 compared to a year of revenue in 2007. This
decrease was only partially offset by engineering development revenue related to
the test bus phase of the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program. The
costs associated with these engineering development revenues are included in
research and development expenses.</FONT></P>

<PAGE>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Material Products revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.4 million, or 10%, compared to 2007,
due primarily to decreased customer volumes as a result of the impact of a three
month labor strike affecting a key customer prior to its resolution in May 2008
combined with lower automotive sales due to the current unprecedented slow down
in the U.S. automotive industry.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Power Generation product and
service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $5.7 million, or
78%, compared to 2006. Higher non-recurring engineering service revenues for
government contracts in the material handling and back-up power markets
primarily drove the increase in the year. Increased unit sales of cogeneration,
material handling and back-up power fuel cell products, partially offset by
lower pricing, also contributed to the increase. Power Generation engineering
development revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $0.4
million, or 7%, compared to 2006, and were derived from our 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell program.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Automotive product and service
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $1.5 million, or 9%,
compared to 2006. Increased automotive fuel cell product shipments were offset
by a decline in automotive service revenues due to a lower number of fuel cell
buses under service contracts. The decline in field service revenues for fuel
cell buses was expected as the field trials were winding down. Automotive
service revenues were primarily earned from field service activities supporting
fuel cell buses in Europe, Australia and China.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Automotive engineering development
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $8.5 million, or 116%,
compared to 2006. The increase in automotive engineering development revenue
reflects the planned timing of performance of work and timing of achievement of
development milestones under our automotive fuel cell development program for
our customers, the related costs of which are included in research and
development expenses.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Material Products revenues for

31, 2008 were $47.4 million, an increase of $22.3 million, or 89%, compared to
2007. The $22.3 million increase for the year was driven by lower reversals of
accrued warranty liabilities in 2008 as compared to 2007, increased product
shipments in the bus, material handling, back-up power and automotive markets,
enhanced warranty terms and a change in sales mix towards higher power units in
the material handling market and costs incurred for new automotive testing and
engineering services provided to AFCC. These increases were partially offset by
lower residential cogeneration product costs due to the delivery of fuel cell
MEAs instead of fuel cell stacks and reduced service costs related to fewer fuel
cell buses under service contracts. As mentioned above, cost of product sales
was lower in 2007 compared to 2008 due in part to the reversal of accrued
warranty liabilities of $8.9 million in 2007, compared to $0.4 million in 2008.
The 2007 reductions in accrued warranty liabilities were primarily due to cost
reductions, contractual expirations and improved lifetime for our Automotive
fuel cells whereas the 2008 reductions were primarily due to contractual
expirations and improved lifetimes of our Power Generation fuel
cells.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Gross margins on product and
service revenues declined in 2008 to $5.3 million, compared to $18.3 million for
2007. This year over year decrease of $13.0 million was driven by larger
reductions in warranty provisions for 2007 compared to 2008, more aggressive
product pricing and enhanced warranty coverage on material handling products in
order to encourage market adoption, declines in field service revenues for fuel
cell buses, declines in service revenue and higher program expenditures on Power
Generation non-recurring engineering government contracts, and lower volumes of
carbon fiber products due to the effects of a labor strike affecting a key
customer (resolved in the second quarter of 2008) and the slow down in the U.S.
automotive industry. These declines were only partially offset by increased
margins as a result of new testing and engineering services provided to AFCC and
the commencement of shipments of fuel cell bus modules related to the B.C.

$3.8 million, or 18%, compared to 2006. The $3.8 million increase for 2007 was
driven by higher automotive and cogeneration product shipments and costs
incurred for new government contracts in the material handling market partially
offset by lower costs related to automotive service revenues due to a lower
number of fuel cell buses under service contracts. Cost of product and service
revenue was also affected by the reduction of warranty provisions of $8.9
million in 2007 compared to $5.8 million in 2006. The reductions in accrued
warranty liabilities were primarily due to cost reductions, contractual
expirations and improved lifetime for our automotive fuel cells. Gross margins
on product and service revenues improved in 2007 to $18.3 million, compared to
$15.3 million in 2006. This increase was driven by the reductions in warranty
provisions mentioned above combined with increased volumes in our carbon fiber
products, partially offset by lower gross margins in our Power Generation
segment as increased volumes were offset by lower sales prices, and lower gross
margins in our Automotive segment as declines in field service for buses offset
increased margins on automotive fuel cell products.</FONT></P>

disposition of our automotive fuel cell development programs on the closing of
the AFCC Transaction, partially offset by increased investment in our Power
Generation and fuel cell bus programs and the negative effects of a stronger

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Investment income was $2.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 75%,
compared to 2007. The decrease was a result of lower average cash balances in
2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to the $60 million cash transfer in the AFCC
Transaction, combined with declining interest rates in the last half of 2007 and
into 2008. We classify our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as
held-for-trading and measure these assets at fair value with changes in fair
value recognized in income. The fair values are determined directly by reference
to quoted market prices. During 2008, the investment market was negatively
impacted by liquidity and credit market concerns along with increased concerns
about a global economic slowdown. We continue to review our exposure to these
issues and have determined that there are no material impacts on our investment
portfolio. In addition, we do not hold any asset-backed commercial paper that
was issued by a non-bank trust.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Foreign exchange gains and losses
are attributable to the effect of the changes in the value of the Canadian
dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, on our Canadian dollar-denominated net
monetary assets and on outstanding foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell
Canadian dollars over the respective periods. The foreign exchange loss of $3.7
million for 2008 resulted from the weakening of the Canadian dollar in 2008.
Compared to the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar has weakened in 2008 from 0.99
at December 31, 2007 to 1.22 at December 31, 2008. In addition to foreign
exchange contracts, we hold Canadian dollar cash and short-term investments to
reduce the foreign currency risk inherent in expenditures denominated in
Canadian dollars. Our foreign denominated cash and short-term investments do not
qualify for hedge accounting and therefore foreign exchange gains and losses are
recognized when they occur.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>See note 19 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information about the significance of
financial instruments to our financial position and performance, the nature and

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Other income was $1.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008 and relates to administrative services
contracts with AFCC under which we provide accounting, supply chain, human
resources, information technology, facilities and other administrative
support.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Investment and other income for
the year ended December 31, 2007 was $16.9 million, an increase of $7.0 million,
or 70%, compared to 2006. The increase is due to foreign exchange gains in 2007
of $8.7 million partially offset by lower investment income of $1.7 million.
Foreign exchange gains in 2007 were a result of movements in the Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar on our net monetary assets and liabilities. Compared
to the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar strengthened from 1.17 at December 31,
2006 to 0.99 at December 31, 2007. Investment income declined in 2007 due to
lower average cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006 combined with declining
interest rates in the last half of 2007.</FONT></P>

The increase in equity losses in 2008 is due to the negative effects of a

introduction of its next generation system product in Japan and increased
residential cogeneration market development activities.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>CASH FLOWS</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments were $85.4 million as at December 31, 2008, compared to
$145.6 million at the end of 2007. The decrease of $60.2 million in 2008 was
driven by the transfer of $60 million to Daimler, Ford and AFCC as part of the
AFCC Transaction combined with a net loss (excluding non-cash items) of $35.1
million, net investment in EBARA BALLARD of $5.9 million and net capital
expenditures of $3.1 million partially offset by working capital cash inflows of
$8.9 million and proceeds from the non-dilutive financing Arrangement with
Superior of $36.9 million.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>For the year ended December 31,
2008, working capital requirements resulted in cash inflows of $8.9 million
compared to cash outflows of $13.8 million for 2007. In 2008, working capital
cash inflows were driven by lower inventory of $4.5 million due to higher fourth
quarter Power Generation shipments and fuel cell bus product shipments combined
with improved inventory management and increased platinum recoveries, higher
accrued warranty liabilities of $3.1 million as a result of the above noted
fourth quarter product shipments, and higher deferred revenue of $0.8 million
due to the timing of payments on pre-funded contracts.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>For the year ended December 31,
2007, working capital requirements resulted in cash outflows of $13.8 million
compared to $12.3 million for 2006. In 2007, cash outflows were impacted by
higher accounts receivable of $4.1 million due to higher fourth quarter
engineering development revenue compared to the prior year and the timing of
collections of our product and engineering development revenues, combined with
increased working capital requirements of $4.6 million related to assets and
liabilities held for sale. The $4.6 million cash outflow from current assets and
current liabilities held for sale primarily represent lower accrued warranty
liabilities to service our automotive fuel cells, along with warranty
adjustments for expirations, lower projected costs and improved lifetimes. Cash
outflows from accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.7 million were
primarily due to the timing of payments combined with lower accrued liabilities
as a result of settlement in the year of previously disputed amounts, partially
offset by increased employee bonus accruals.</FONT></P>

cash outflows of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
cash inflows of $19.8 million in 2007. Changes in short-term investments
resulted in cash inflows of $64.9 million in 2008 as compared to inflows of
$29.4 million in 2007 as balances changed between cash equivalents and
short-term investments as we made investment decisions with regards to the term
of investments in response to changes in yield curves in order to improve our
investment returns and in response to the $60 million funding requirement to
close the AFCC Transaction in the first quarter of 2008. Net capital spending of
$3.1 million in 2008 was primarily for manufacturing equipment, compared to net
capital spending in 2007 of $6.4 million primarily for manufacturing, test and
computer equipment. The cash flows used for other investing activities in 2008
of $6.2 million represent a net investment in EBARA BALLARD of $5.9 million,
comprising of an additional investment of $11.2 million offset by licensing cash
receipts of $5.3 million, combined with an investment in Chrysalix of $0.3

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>As at December 31, 2008, we had

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>At this stage of our development,
we expect to record losses for at least the next few years as we continue to
make significant investments in research, and product and market development
activities necessary to commercialize our products. Our actual funding
requirements will vary based on the factors noted above, our relationships with
our lead customers and strategic partners, our success in developing new
channels to market and relationships with customers, our success in generating
revenue growth from near-term product opportunities, our working capital
requirements, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the progress and results of our
research, development and demonstration programs.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Our financial strategy is to
manage our cash resources with strong fiscal discipline, focus on markets with
high product and service revenue growth potential, license technology in cases
where it is advantageous to us, and access available government funding for
research and development projects. Our current financing principle is to
maintain cash balances sufficient to fund at least six quarters of operating
cash consumption at all times. We believe that our current cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, combined with our ability to potentially
monetize other assets, including our interest in AFCC through the share purchase
agreement with Ford, are sufficient to meet our planned growth and development
activities for the foreseeable future without the need to access public market
financing. However, circumstances could change which would make it advantageous

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We expect overall revenues for

2008.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Fuel Cell Products revenue is
expected to increase in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to volume
increases in our back-up power, bus and material handling markets as a result of
our announced ACME (subject to product acceptance test in the fourth quarter of
2009), Dantherm, B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program, Transport of
London fuel cell bus program and Plug Power Central Grocer agreements. This
increase in Fuel Cell Products revenue is expected to be partially offset by
declines in Fuel Cell Products service revenues due to the completion of our
existing engineering service government contracts in the material handling and
back-up power markets, and declines in Fuel Cell Products engineering
development revenues due to the completion of our 1kW residential cogeneration
fuel cell development program in 2008. Residential cogeneration product revenues
in 2009 are expected to be similar to 2008 as the program is still in the
development stage of the Japanese government trial program.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Supporting business revenues are
expected to decline in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower
technical services and lower contract manufacturing for AFCC, Daimler and Ford.
Material Products revenues in 2009 are expected to be similar to 2008 due to the
continued slow down in the U.S. automotive industry, partially offset by growth
in fuel cell GDL material sales.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We expect our operating cash
consumption (see Non-GAAP Measures) for 2009 to be between $17 million to $27
million, compared to $29.3 million in 2008 assuming no material fluctuations in
U.S. / Canadian dollar exchange rates. A primary driver for this expected
reduction in operating cash consumption for 2009 is expected increases in gross
margins as a result of increased product sales, combined with additional
reductions in operating expenses, to more than offset our increased investment
in production capacity. As a result of the timing of capital expenditures,
working capital impacts related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic and Transport
of London fuel cell bus programs, and the payment of 2008 employee bonuses in
the first half of 2009, operating cash consumption is expected to be higher in
the first half of 2009, as compared to the second half of the year.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
&amp; CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We maintain a 19.9% interest in
AFCC which is subject to a share purchase agreement under which Ford, either at
our option or Ford&#146;s election, may purchase our interest in AFCC at any time on
or after January 31, 2013 for $65 million plus interest accruing at LIBOR from
January 31, 2008. The purchase may take place earlier than January 31, 2013 if
certain other events occur. Under Canadian GAAP, this share purchase agreement
is considered a derivative instrument and is therefore measured and recorded at
its fair value on the closing of the AFCC Transaction. We have recorded this
derivative at its fair value of $1 representing the difference between the
discounted present value of the share purchase agreement on closing and the
value of the underlying transferred AFCC assets. This derivative instrument is
carried at cost and is not marked to market each reporting period as we do not
believe it is possible to regularly determine its reliable fair value. If the
share purchase agreement were to be held to maturity and exercised on January
31, 2013, we anticipate that we would receive proceeds of approximately $68
million (based on current interest rates) and record an estimated gain of
approximately $67 million on the sale of our remaining 19.9% interest in AFCC.
If we were to monetize this share purchase agreement prior to its maturity date
of January 31, 2013, the amount of proceeds received would be subject to a
number of variables including Ford&#146;s cost of borrowing, expected future LIBOR
rates, time remaining to January 31, 2013 and general market and other
conditions. Under present economic conditions, we believe that these factors
would result in a significant discount to the face value of the share purchase
agreement.</FONT></P>

<PAGE>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Periodically, we use foreign
exchange contracts to manage our exposure to currency rate fluctuations and
platinum forward purchase contracts to manage our exposure to platinum price
fluctuations. We record these contracts at their fair value as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our
consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding
forward exchange contracts to sell a total of Canadian $8 million at an average
rate of $1.12 Canadian per $1.00 United States dollar, resulting in an
unrealized loss of $0.6 million. In addition, we had outstanding platinum

<PAGE>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The Arrangement with Superior Plus
includes an indemnification agreement dated December 31, 2008 (the "Indemnity
Agreement"), which sets out the parties&#146; continuing obligations to the other.
The Indemnity Agreement has two basic elements: it provides for the
indemnification by each of the parties to the other for breaches of
representations and warranties or covenants as well as, in our case, any
liability relating to our business which is suffered by Superior Plus. Our
indemnity to Superior Plus with respect to our representation relating to the
existence of our tax pools immediately prior to the completion of the
Arrangement is limited to an aggregate of $6.1 million (Canadian $7.4 million)
with a threshold amount of $0.4 million (Canadian $0.5 million) before there is
an obligation to make a payment. Second, the Indemnity Agreement provides for
adjustments to be paid by us, or to us, depending on the final determination of
the amount of our Canadian non-capital losses, scientific research and
development expenditures and investment tax credits generated to December 31,
2008, to the extent that such amounts are more or less than the amounts
estimated at the time the Arrangement was executed. At December 31, 2008, we
have not accrued any amount owing, or receivable, as a result of the Indemnity
Agreement as we have not yet finalized our 2008 Canadian income tax return and
agreed upon any differences with Superior Plus.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Related parties include
shareholders with a significant ownership interest in us, together with their
subsidiaries and affiliates, our key management personnel and our

reflect the prices and terms of sale and purchase transactions with related

include EBARA BALLARD and EBARA Corporation, and prior to the closing of the
AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008, Daimler and Ford. AFCC is not considered
to be a related party, as we do not have the ability to exercise significant

parties from the sale of products and services and from engineering development

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Our business entails risks and
uncertainties that affect our outlook and eventual results of our business and
commercialization plans. The primary risks relate to meeting our product
development and commercialization milestones, which require that our products
exhibit the functionality, cost, durability and performance required in a
commercial product and that we have sufficient access to capital to fund these
activities. To be commercially useful, most of our products must be integrated
into products manufactured by system integrators or OEMs. There is no guarantee
that system integrators or OEMs will provide products that use our products as
components. There is also a risk that mass markets for certain of our products
may never develop, or that market acceptance might take longer to develop than
anticipated.</FONT></P>

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Disclosure controls and
procedures </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is
gathered and reported to senior management, including the President and Chief
Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) and the Corporate Controller and Acting Chief
Financial Officer (&#147;CFO&#148;), on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can
be made regarding public disclosure. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>As of the end of the period
covered by this report, we evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the CEO and the CFO, the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13(a) &#150; 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#147;Exchange Act&#148;).
We have concluded that as of December 31, 2008, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified therein, and
accumulated and reported to management to allow timely discussions regarding
required disclosure. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Internal control over financial
reporting </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The CEO and CFO, together with
other members of management, are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over the Company&#146;s financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is designed under our supervision, and effected
by the Company&#146;s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in Canada and the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, as
applicable.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>There are inherent limitations in
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal controls can change with
circumstances. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Management, including the CEO and
CFO, have evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting in relation to criteria described in </FONT><I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Internal Control&#150;Integrated Framework</FONT></I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;). Based on this evaluation, we have determined that internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>KPMG LLP, our independent
registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial
statements and expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. </FONT><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>KPMG has also expressed an unqualified opinion on the

over financial reporting </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>During the year ended December 31,
2008, there were no material changes in internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Non-GAAP Measures
</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We use certain non-GAAP measures
to assist in assessing our financial performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP
measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are
therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other
companies. A description of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to financial
statement line items for the periods indicated are as follows: </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><I><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Normalized net
loss</FONT></I></B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2> measures our net loss after
excluding items that are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal
continued operating activity of the business. Gains on sale of assets held for
sale, losses from discontinued operations and write-downs of long-lived assets
are not considered part of our core activities, and are expected to occur
infrequently. Therefore we have removed these in our calculation of normalized
net loss. We believe normalized net loss assists investors in assessing our
performance.</FONT></P>

</FONT></B><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The consolidated financial
statements contained in this Annual Report have been prepared by management in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The
integrity and objectivity of the data in these consolidated financial statements
are management&#146;s responsibility. Management is also responsible for all other
information in the Annual Report and for ensuring that this information is
consistent, where appropriate, with the information and data contained in the
consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect fraud or misstatements because of limitations inherent in any
system of internal control. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the
Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that the Corporation&#146;s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.
In addition, management maintains disclosure controls and procedures to provide
reasonable assurance that material information is communicated to management and
appropriately disclosed. Some of the assets and liabilities include amounts,
which are based on estimates and judgments, as their final determination is
dependent on future events. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The Board of Directors oversees
management&#146;s responsibilities for financial reporting through the Audit
Committee, which consists of five directors who are independent and not involved
in the daily operations of the Corporation. The Audit Committee meets on a
regular basis with management and the external and internal auditors to discuss
internal controls over the financial reporting process, auditing matters and
financial reporting issues. The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing
the external auditors (subject to shareholder approval), and reviewing and
approving all financial disclosure contained in our public documents and related
party transactions. </FONT></P>
<HR align=center width="100%" noShade SIZE=2>
<PAGE>
<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>The external auditors, KPMG LLP,
have audited the financial statements and expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. KPMG has also expressed an unqualified opinion on the effective
operation of the internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008. The external auditors have full access to management and the Audit
Committee with respect to their findings concerning the fairness of financial
reporting and the adequacy of internal controls. </FONT></P>

we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>We have audited Ballard Power

of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal

obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable

<P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%"><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>In February 2008,
      Canada&#146;s Accounting Standards Board (&#147;AcSB&#148;) confirmed the date of
      changeover from GAAP to </FONT><FONT face=sans-serif size=2><EM>International Financial Reporting Standards </EM>(&#147;IFRS&#148;).
      Canadian publicly accountable enterprises must adopt IFRS for their
      interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning
      on or after January 1, 2011. While IFRS uses a conceptual framework
      similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant differences on
      recognition, measurement and disclosures. The Corporation, with the
      assistance of an external expert advisor, has begun a high level review of
      the major differences between Canadian GAAP and IFRS. This work is
      expected to be completed in 2009.</FONT></TD></TR>

      <P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>On December 31, 2008, the
      Corporation completed a restructuring transaction with Superior Plus
      Income Fund (&#147;Superior Plus&#148;) to reorganize the Corporation&#146;s business
      under a Plan of Arrangement (the &#147;Arrangement&#148;). Pursuant to the
      Arrangement, Superior Plus transferred $38,029,000 (CDN $46,319,000) to
      the Corporation&#146;s parent company (&#147;Old Ballard&#148;). Old Ballard subsequently
      transferred all of its assets and liabilities (including the net cash
      proceeds, but excluding Old Ballard&#146;s historic Canadian income tax carry
      forward attributes), to a new wholly owned company, (&#147;the Corporation&#148;).
      Old Ballard&#146;s shareholders exchanged their shares, on a one-for-one basis,
      for shares of the Corporation. The Corporation will now carry on the full
      scope of the Old Ballard&#146;s business operations, and will hold all rights
      to intellectual property, as held by Old Ballard prior to the completion
      of the Arrangement.</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>As the transfer of the
      business assets, liabilities and operations from Old Ballard to the
      Corporation represented a transaction with no change in shareholder
      ownership, the transaction was accounted for using continuity of interest

      Daimler and Ford returned to the Corporation an aggregate of 34,261,298 of
      its common shares valued at $173,900,000, one Class A share and one Class

      <P align=justify><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>On February 15, 2007, the
      Corporation disposed of its electric drive operations, Ballard Power
      Systems Corporation (&#147;BPSC&#148;), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary to a
      third party. Net proceeds on disposition were $1,689,000, which included
      cash proceeds of $3,754,000, partly offset by disposal cost of $2,065,000.
      The total net loss on disposal of $108,464,000 was recorded as a net loss
      of $111,355,000 in 2006 and an offsetting net gain of $2,891,000 in 2007
      primarily as a result of employee future benefit plan curtailments in
      2007. Upon closing, the Corporation ceased to consolidate the results of
      BPSC.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
