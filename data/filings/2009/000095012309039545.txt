</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This announcement contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the &#147;safe
harbor&#148; provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as &#147;will,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148;
&#147;future,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;confident&#148; and similar statements. Among other
things, the quotations from management in this announcement, as well as AirMedia Group Inc.&#146;s
strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. AirMedia may also make written
or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on Forms 20-F and 6-K, etc., in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and
other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to
third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about AirMedia&#146;s
beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve
inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, if advertisers or the viewing public do not accept,
or lose interest in, our air travel advertising network, we may be unable to generate sufficient
cash flow from our operating activities and our prospects and results of operations could be
negatively affected; we derive substantially all of our revenues from the provision of air travel
advertising services, and recent slowdown in the air travel advertising industry in China may
materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operation; our strategy of expanding
our advertising network by expanding into traditional media and building new media platforms may
not succeed, and our failure to do so could materially reduce the attractiveness of our network and
harm our business, reputation and results of operations; if our customers reduce their advertising
spending due to an economic downturn in China and/or elsewhere or for any other reason, our
revenues and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected; if we are unable to
retain existing concession rights contracts or obtain new concession rights contracts on
commercially advantageous terms that allow us to operate our advertising platforms, we may be
unable to maintain or expand our network coverage and our business and prospects may be harmed; a
significant portion of our revenues has been derived from the five largest airports and three
largest airlines in China, and if any of these airports or airlines experiences a material business
disruption, our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations would be materially and
adversely affected; AirMedia&#146;s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future
prospects and results of operations; and other risks outlined in AirMedia&#146;s filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. AirMedia does not undertake any obligation to update any
forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.
