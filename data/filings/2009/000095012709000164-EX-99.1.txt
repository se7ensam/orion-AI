                              Acergy S.A. Notice of
                  Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders

London, England - June 26, 2009 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock
Exchange: ACY) announced today that an Extraordinary Meeting of Shareholders
(the "Meeting") will take place at the offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route d'Esch,
L-2086 Luxembourg on August 4, 2009 at 2 p.m. local time for the purpose of
considering resolutions 9 and 10 of the Annual General Meeting Agenda.

It was noted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 22, 2009 that
the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for resolutions 9 and 10
was not present and this meeting was therefore not able to consider these
resolutions.

The Board of Directors therefore decided to call an Extraordinary General
Meeting to consider resolutions 9 and 10. At this Meeting there is no
requirement for quorum. However, to approve the proposed resolutions a 2/3rd
majority of the votes cast at the Meeting will be required.

Proxies already received for the May 22, 2009 Annual General Meeting remain
valid for this Meeting and Shareholders of record as of Tuesday March 31, 2009
are entitled to vote at the Meeting. Those Shareholders who have not yet cast
their votes may do so by submitting the already distributed proxy card as
instructed, or alternatively to attend the Meeting in Luxembourg at the above
address. The new deadline for submission of votes for American Depositary
Receipt holders is July 22, 2009 and for holders of Common Shares July 24, 2009.

The Board expects to call an Extraordinary General Meeting later in the year to
consider a proposal for updated Articles of Incorporation and a new Long-Term
Incentive Plan. In addition, the Board expects to propose additional directors.

The Board's Governance and Nomination Committee process of identifying and
communicating with potential additional directors is progressing well.
