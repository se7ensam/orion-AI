London, England - January 12, 2009 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock
Exchange: ACY) announced today the completion of the sale of Acergy Piper to
Saipem (Portugal) Comercio Maritimo S.U. Lda for $78 million.

Acergy Piper, a semi-submersible pipelay barge, which has operated primarily in
the North Sea and more recently on the Mexilhao Project in Brazil, is the
Company's sole operating unit in the non-core trunkline market.

Jean Cahuzac, Chief Executive Officer, said "This is another step forward in our
fleet management programme enabling us to continue to differentiate our
capabilities in the difficult and harsh environments in which we operate. The
sale further enhances our already strong balance sheet and allows management to
concentrate on our core markets.

I would like to thank those who have been involved in Acergy Piper activities
for their work and wish them continued success."
