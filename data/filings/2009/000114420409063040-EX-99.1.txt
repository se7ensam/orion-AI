endorsement on A-Power’s engineering capability and production capacity, which
also started gain traction from wind farms in both China and other geographic
markets," said Mr. Jinxiang Lu, A-Power's Chairman and CEO. "On DG side of our
business, together government backed Shenyang Power Group, we are well
positioned to win high-profile contracts for DG systems and micro power grids
both in China and overseas."
     
    Mr. Lu
continued, "Our DG business progressed well during the third quarter. 14 out of
our total 17 projects were under construction according to their respective

our track records continue to extend. We also started our DG project in Thailand

    Third
Quarter 2009 Financial Results
     
    For the
three months ended September 30, 2009, total revenues amounted to $96.7 million,
an increase of $11.3 million or 13.2%, from $85.4 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the higher revenues
from more on-going DG projects during the three months ended September 30, 2009
compared with the same period of 2008. All revenues in the third quarter of 2009
and 2008 were from the Company's DG operations.
    
      
         

      
      
         

        
          
        
      
      
         

      
    
     
    Gross
profit was $12.6 million, compared with $10.5 million in the same period of
2008, reflecting a 20% year over year growth. Gross margin was 13.1%, a slight
increase over 12.4% in the same period of 2008. The improvement in gross margin
was mainly attributable to higher efficiency derived from cost-saving in labor
as the Company undertook larger, 30MW-plus DG projects.
     
    Selling,
general and administrative expenses amounted to approximately $3.3 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2009, an increase of approximately $1.3
million, or 66.7%, compared to approximately $2.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2008. As a percentage of revenues, these expenses increased
from 2.3% in the third quarter of 2008 to 3.4% for the third quarter of 2009.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in both absolute
terms and as a percentage of revenues was mainly attributable to higher travel
expenses associated with wind turbine business, compensations for new management
team, additional consulting fees and related expenses of being a public company
listed on the NASDAQ. The year-over-year incremental share-based compensation
was approximately $183,000.
     
    Operating
income was $9.4 million, compared with $8.6 million in the same period of 2008,
reflecting a 9% year over year increase.
    
    Non-GAAP
net income was $9.8 million compared with $9.6 million in the third quarter of
2008. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.28, compared with $0.28 in the third quarter
of 2008, based on a greater number of diluted shares outstanding.
    
    GAAP net
loss for the third quarter was $0.6 million, compared with a net income of $9.4
million in the same period of 2008. Diluted loss per share (EPS) were $0.02,
compared with $0.28 in the same period of 2008.
     
    For the
third quarter of 2009, the weighted average number of shares on a fully diluted
basis was 34.9 million as compared to 33.9 million in the same period of
2008.

    As of
September 30, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash totaling $97.6 million, compared with $47.1 million as of December,
2008.
     
    Total
shareholders' equity rose to $168.4 million at September 30, 2009, from $156.0
million at December 31, 2008.
     
    Outlook
for the Full Year 2009
     
    A-Power
today reaffirmed its revenue and non-GAAP net income guidance for 2009 of $320
million and $32 million, respectively. These targets are based on the Company's
current DG contracts, which are subject to change when the Company signs new DG
contracts and/or recognizes revenues from wind turbine sales during 2009.
A-Power expects that it will from time to time provide periodic updates when
additional major DG contracts and wind turbine sales are confirmed.
     
    Mr. Lu
concluded, "Most of 14 ongoing DG projects progressed well in the third quarter
and would likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well. Going into fourth
quarter, we anticipate the payments will gradually funnel in, as many
construction projects are advanced and some are near the completion. As our wind
turbine facility is gathering speed on production, we remain cautiously
optimistic on wind turbine shipment in the fourth quarter."

    Use
of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     
    We have
provided third quarter 2008 and 2009 net income and earnings (or loss) per share
on a non-GAAP basis, which is the GAAP net income adjusted by adding back
share-based compensation, accretion expenses on convertible debt, loss on change
in fair value of warrants, loss on change in fair value of embedded derivative
related to convertible notes, and deferred financing cost. We believe both
management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures in
assessing our business operation and financial performance. These non-GAAP
operating measures are useful for understanding and assessing underlying
business performance and operating trends. We expect to continue providing net
income on a non-GAAP basis using a consistent method on a quarterly
basis.
     
    Safe
Harbor Statement
     
    This
press release may contain forward-looking statements. Any such statement is made
within the 'safe harbor' provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends,"
"plans," "believes," "estimates," and other similar statements. Statements that
are not historical facts, including statements relating to anticipated future
earnings, margins, and other operating results, future growth, construction
plans and anticipated capacities, production schedules and entry into expanded
markets are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements, based
upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management, are subject to
risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially
from the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, the risk
that: inclement weather conditions could adversely affect our operating results
in particular quarters and/or fiscal years; we may experience construction,
manufacturing and development delays on our projects which could adversely
affect our financial condition and operating results; the development of our
wind turbine business will depend on the efforts of others; development of our
wind turbine business will depend on our ability to efficiently source
components; our customers may be late in their payments to us; our customers may
not be able to receive the permits they require to install the wind turbines we
sell them, delaying our recognition of sales revenues; we have not at this time
signed definitive purchase and supply agreements related to our designation to
supply wind turbines to the wind farm in West Texas; our limited operating
history and recent entrance into new markets and the wind turbine business may
make it difficult for you to evaluate our business and future prospects; the
expected benefits of supply and partnership agreements may not materialize to
the extent expected or at all; we expect to rely increasingly on our proprietary
products and systems and on technology developed by our licensors and partners,
and if we or our licensors or partners become involved in an intellectual
property dispute, we may be forced to spend considerable resources resolving
such dispute; various memorandum of understandings we signed with third parties
may not evolve into definitive contracts and thus, we may not derive revenues
from such agreements; we may have difficulties working with our joint venture
partners, and may not be able to establish successful partnerships; we may not
be able to complete the acquisition of our intended targets; a decrease in the
rate of growth of China's industry and economy may lead to a decrease in our
revenues because industrial companies in China are our principal source of
revenues, as well as other relevant risks detailed in our filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including those set forth in our annual
report filed on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. The
information set forth herein should be read in light of such risks. We assume no
obligation to update the information contained in this press release, except as
required under applicable law.
