meetings shall be held at the Company's place of incorporation or at such other

meetings shall be called by the Chairman or on his behalf by the Sec­retary.
A meeting shall also be called by the Chairman upon the written re­quest of

      Notice of
meetings shall be given ten days in advance in writing and the notice shall set
forth the agenda. Each member of the Board may demand that items be placed on
the agenda. The relevant request must be submitted in writ­ing to the
Chairman at least 14 days before the meeting. Urgent items that are brought up
after the notice of the meeting has been distrib­uted may be dis­cussed
at the meeting. Resolutions on such matters can only be passed if all Board
members attending the meeting agree. In urgent cases, the Chairman may call a
meeting at short no­tice in writing or by other convenient means of
commu­nication.
       
      Meetings
of the Board may be held in person or by telephone confe­rence or other

Resolutions. The Board shall have a quorum when the major­ity of its members

effect the amendment of the Articles of As­sociation related
thereto.
       
      Subject
to Article V, Section 5 of these Regulations, resolutions of the Board shall be
adopted upon a ma­jority of the votes cast. In case of a tie, the acting
chairman has a casting vote.
       
      Resolutions
may also be passed in writing, provided no Board member requests oral
delib­eration within 3 business days of notification of the proposal. To be
valid, resolutions in writing must have been communicated to all Board members,
and must have been approved in writing by a majority of the Board
members.
       
      In urgent
cases, the Board may pass circular resolutions by e-mail, provided that all
members of the Board have received the proposed resolutions and that none of the
members requests that the matter be deliberated at a board meeting. Any such
urgent circular resolutions shall be ratified by the Board at a subsequent
meeting or by circular resolution in writing.
       
      Section

      Section
9. Compensation.
All members of the Board, except for the Chairman and the CEO, shall be paid an
annual cash retainer for their ser­vices as directors out of the funds of
the Company. Such compensation, including any award of nonqualified stock
options, restricted stock or restricted stock units to non-employee directors,
shall be determined by the Compensation Committee.  A non-employee
director is defined as being neither a member of Nestlé’s board of directors nor
a full-time employee of Nestlé or Alcon.
       
      In
addition to the above, the directors shall be paid out of the funds of the
Com­pany all expenses properly incurred by them in the discharge of their
duties, in­cluding their expenses of traveling to and from the meetings of
the Board, meetings of the Board Com­mittee, Shareholders' Meetings and
sepa­rate meetings of the holders of any class of securities of the
Company.
       
      The Board
may grant special compensation to any director who per­forms any special or
extra services to or at the request of the Company. Special compensation may be
made payable to a director who has performed any special or extra services in
addition to his ordinary compensation (if any) as a di­rector.

      Section
2. General.
A Board member who believes that he may have a Conflicting Interest (Conflicting Director) which
involves the Company shall inform the Chairman of the fact and the nature of the
Conflicting Interest as soon as he becomes aware of such Conflicting Interest.
In the event that the Chairman becomes aware of a Board member’s potential
Conflicting Interest, the Chairman shall promptly contact the potentially
Conflicting Director and discuss with the Conflicting Director the nature and
extent of such Conflicting Interest.
       
      Upon
receipt of the notice that a Board member has a Conflicting Interest, or upon
the Chairman becoming aware of a Conflicting Interest of a Board member, the
Chairman will implement the appropriate measures to ensure that the interests of
the Company are adequately protected. The Chairman will resolve to what extent
the Conflicting Director shall be excluded from information and deliberations
relating to the matter giving rise to the Conflicting Interest. At the next
meeting of the Board, the Chairman shall inform the Board about the Conflicting
Interest and the measures taken in order to adequately protect the Company. To
the extent that a Board member disagrees with the conclusion that a Conflicting
Interest exists or with the measures taken to address such Conflicting Interest,
he may request that the Board consisting of non-Conflicted Directors only shall
resolve as to the issue of the existence of a Conflicting Interest and the
measures to be taken.
       
      
        
           

        
        
           

           

        
        
           

        
      
      In the
event that the Chairman is the Conflicting Director, the Chairman or any Board
member who becomes aware of the Conflicting Interest shall inform the Board
about the Conflicting Interest and, following a discussion with the Chairman,
the members of the Board other than the Chairman shall determine the appropriate
measures to take to protect the Company’s interests and determine to what extent
the Chairman shall be excluded from pertinent information, the deliberations and
the voting relating to the matter giving rise to the Conflicting
Interest.
       
      Subject
to any applicable statutory provisions to the contrary, a Board member shall not
be disqualified by his office from entering into any contract with the Company
(either with regard to his tenure of any office or position with the
Com­pany, or as vendor, purchaser or otherwise).
       
      Section
3. Duty to
Abstain. Members of the Board shall abstain from exercising their voting rights
in matters involving a Conflicting Interest; it being understood that they shall
abstain from participating in, or receiving any information in respect of, any
item or matter brought before the Board or any Board Committee in which they may
have a Competitive Interest. If a Board member is re­quired to abstain from
voting in a matter, he shall not be counted in the quorum of the meeting in
question. In addition, such Board mem­ber, as well as the other members of
the Board, shall use their respective best efforts to ensure that the Board
member with the Conflicting Interest does not receive any non-public,
proprietary and/or confidential in­formation with respect to such matter. In
particular, and without limitation to the foregoing, a Board member shall not
vote or be counted in the quorum of the meeting in respect of any resolution
concerning the following matters:
       
      
        
            
              
                (a)  
              
              
                his own appointment, including
      fixing and varying its terms;

                the termination of his own
      appointment as the holder of any office with the Company or any other
      company in which the Company holds an equity
  in­terest;

                any transaction in which he or
      any Related Person is an inter­ested
party.
              
            
        
      
       
      Notwithstanding the provisions of the
foregoing paragraph, a director shall be entitled to vote and be counted in the
quorum on:
       
      
        
            
              
                (a)
              
              
                any
      issue or offer of securities of the Company in respect of which the
      direc­tor or any Related Party is or may be entitled to participate in
      their ca­pacity as holder of any such
  securities;

                any
      contract in which he or any Related Party is interested only by virtue of
      his interest in securities of the
Company;
