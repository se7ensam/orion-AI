Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may
include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
statements may be identified by the use of words like "anticipate," "believe,"
"estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "forecast", "project," "will,"
"should," "seek," and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not
limited to, statements as to the expected timing of publishing our 2009
pre-close trading update and the expected timing of publishing quarterly
financial results for 2010. The forward-looking statements reflect our current
views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following
factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause
actual and future results and trends to differ materially from our
forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant
projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and
businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the
outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries;
uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of
ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the
impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and
environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or
predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements.
