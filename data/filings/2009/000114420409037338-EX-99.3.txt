PROXY
STATEMENT
       
      General
       
      We are
soliciting the enclosed proxy on behalf of the board of directors of A-POWER
ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEMS, LTD. (the Company) for use at the annual general
meeting of shareholders to be held on Friday, August 21, 2009 at 9 a.m.,
Shenyang time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.  The
annual general meeting will be held at the Company’s offices located at No. 44
Jingxing North Street, 12th Floor,
Tiexi District, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China 110021.
       
      This
proxy statement is available to shareholders beginning on July 15, 2009, and the
form of proxy is first being mailed to shareholders on or about July 15,
2009.
       
      Revocability of
Proxies
       
      Any proxy
given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at
any time before its use by delivering a written notice of revocation or a duly
executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the annual general meeting
and voting in person. Attendance at the annual general meeting in and of itself
does not revoke a prior proxy. A written notice of revocation must be delivered
to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Co., 17 Battery Place - 8th floor, New
York, NY 10004, Att: Proxy Department.
       
      Record Date, Share Ownership and
Quorum
       
      Shareholders
of record at the close of business on July 15, 2009 are entitled to vote at the
annual general meeting.  As of July 1, 2009, 33,706,938 of the Company’s common
shares, par value US$0.0001 per share, were outstanding.  The presence
in person or by proxy of the holder or holders entitled to exercise at least 50
percent of the voting rights of the shares entitled to vote thereon will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual general
meeting.
       
      Voting
       
      Each
common share outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote. Voting by
holders of common shares at the annual general meeting will be by a show of
hands unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show
of hands) demanded by the chairman of the meeting or any shareholder present in
person or by proxy and holding not less than one tenth of the total voting
shares issued by the Company and having the right to vote at the
meeting.
       
      Voting by Holders of Common
Shares
       
      When
proxies are properly dated, executed and returned by holders of common shares,
the shares they represent will be voted at the annual general meeting in
accordance with the instructions of the shareholder. If no specific instructions
are given by such holders, the proxy will vote the shares in his or her
discretion, unless a reference to the holder of the proxy having such discretion
has been deleted and initialed in the form of proxy.  Where the
chairman, a director or officer of the Company acts as proxy and is entitled to
exercise his or her discretion, he or she is likely to vote the common shares
“FOR” all of the proposals described in this proxy statement.
       
      Under the
laws of the British Virgin Islands and our Memorandum and Articles of
Association, the holders of our common shares are referred to as “members”
rather than “shareholders.”  In this proxy statement, references that would
otherwise be to members are made to shareholders, which is a term more familiar
to investors trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which is the exchange
on which our shares are listed.
       
      Solicitation
       
      We will
bear all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of
proxies.  We will, upon request, reimburse brokerage firms and other
nominee holders for their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy
solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of our shares.  Our
officers, directors, and employees may solicit proxies by mail, personal
contact, letter, telephone, telegram, facsimile or other electronic
means.  They will not receive any additional compensation for those
activities, but they may be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket
expenses.  In addition, we have hired Morrow & Co., LLC, located
at 470 West Avenue, Stamford, CT 06902, to solicit proxies on our
behalf.  The cost of soliciting proxies on our behalf will be
approximately $12,500 plus costs and expenses. The solicitation materials are
available on the Company’s website at
http://investor.apowerenergy.com.
       
      
        
           

        
        
           

          
            
          
        
        
           

        
      
      PROPOSAL
1
      ISSUANCE
OF ANY COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE NOTES OR
      THE
TERMS OF THE WARRANTS
      
      On June
19, 2009, the Company issued senior convertible notes to certain institutional
investors in an aggregate principal amount of $40,000,000 (the Notes), with an
initial conversion price of $10.637, and warrants to purchase an aggregate
amount of 1,504,184 common shares of the Company (the Warrants).  We
refer to the transaction in which we issued such Notes and Warrants as the
“Transaction” herein.  Both the conversion price of the Notes and the
exercise price of the Warrants are equal to 110% of the market price of the
Company’s common shares as of June 18, 2009 and are subject to adjustment
pursuant to the terms of the Notes and Warrants.  The net proceeds
from the Transaction are being used primarily to secure components for the
Company’s development of its wind turbine assembly business.  The
summary of terms of the Transaction contained in this proxy statement is general
in nature and is qualified by reference to the actual Transaction documents
which are attached as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 6-K furnished to
the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 19, 2009, and which are
incorporated by reference herein.  Shareholders desiring a more
complete understanding of the terms of the Transaction are urged to refer to
those exhibits.
      
      The
Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum (the Restated Memorandum) and Articles
of Association (the Restated Articles) were adopted by the Company’s
shareholders at a special meeting of the shareholders on January 17, 2008.
Article 3 of the Restated Articles as currently in effect, and as in effect on
the date of the Transaction, requires shareholder approval for any issuance of
common shares by the Company. Consequently, until such time as shareholder
approval has been obtained, common shares are not issuable pursuant to the terms
of the Notes (whether pursuant to a conversion of the Notes, as payment of
interest or otherwise) or the Warrants (whether pursuant to an exercise of the
Warrants or otherwise).  The Board of Directors recommends that the
shareholders vote in favor of the issuance of any common shares pursuant to the
terms of the Notes or the terms of the Warrants. In Proposal 2 below we are also
seeking your approval to eliminate this requirement for shareholder approval in
Article 3 of the Restated Articles in order to facilitate the Company’s access
to future financing opportunities.  The Company is not required to,
nor is the Company seeking, shareholder approval for the Transaction
itself.
      
      Pursuant
to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5635(d), the Company must obtain shareholder approval
for the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of common shares (or
securities convertible into or exercisable into common shares) equal to 20% or
more of the common shares or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before
the issuance for less than the greater of book or market value of the shares
(the 20% Rule).  The Nasdaq staff has taken the position that the 20%
Rule is applicable to the Transaction because a future issuance of common shares
by the Company triggering the anti-dilution adjustments in each of the Notes and
the Warrants could result in the conversion price of the Notes or exercise price
of the Warrants falling below the market trading price of the Company’s common
shares in effect at the time that the Notes and Warrants were
issued.  Approval by shareholders of the issuance of common shares in
connection with the Transaction will also constitute approval of the issuance of
common shares under the 20% Rule.  No such dilutive offering is
currently contemplated by the Company.
       
      In the
event that the Company does not obtain shareholder approval, and is therefore
unable to issue common shares pursuant to the terms of the Notes and the
Warrants, the Notes and the Warrants may be exchanged, in whole or in part, for
certain common shares of the Company held by Mr. Jinxiang Lu, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Company.  The Company has entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Lu,
which is designed to make him whole for any reduction in his ownership of the
Company’s common shares resulting from the delivery of any portion of Mr. Lu’s
shares to any holder of the Notes or Warrants, as applicable.  The
terms of this letter agreement are not any more favorable to Mr. Lu than the
terms of the Notes and the Warrants, which have been negotiated and agreed to at
arm’s length between the Company and the institutional investors that initially
purchased the Notes and Warrants.
       
      The
affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or represented
by proxy and voting at the annual general meeting will be required to approve
this proposal.
       
      THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 1,
      ISSUANCE
OF ANY COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE NOTES OR
      THE
TERMS OF THE WARRANTS.

      PROPOSAL
2
      AMENDMENT
OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION TO
      ELIMINATE
SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL REQUIREMENT FOR SHARE ISSUANCES
       
      Pursuant
to the Restated Articles, the directors have the authorization and discretion to
approve the issuance of authorized but unissued shares, either common or
preferred,  subject to authorization by a resolution of the
shareholders.  The board recommends eliminating the requirement of a
resolution of shareholders, as described below. The board believes this will
provide the Company with the ability to issue equity securities for future
transactions in an expeditious manner.  Obtaining shareholder approval
each time the Company desires to issue equity securities may hinder the
Company’s ability to raise capital or to engage in a transaction by using shares
as consideration in a timely manner, and will also cause the Company to incur
expenses related to obtaining shareholder approval.
       
      Articles
3, 4 and 5 of the Restated Articles currently read as follows:

                  Subject
      to the provisions of these Articles, the unissued shares of the Company
      (whether forming part of the original or any increased authorised shares)
      shall be at the disposal of the directors who may, subject to
      authorisation by a resolution of the members in the case of Common Shares,
      offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such
      persons at such times and for such consideration, being not less than the
      par value of the of the shares being disposed of, and upon such terms and
      conditions as the directors may
determine.
                
              
            
        
      
       
      
        
            
              
                 
      
              
              
                4
              
              
                Without
      prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any
      existing shares or class of shares, any share in the Company may, subject
      to authorisation by a resolution of the members in the case of Common
      Shares, be issued with such preferred, deferred or other special rights or
      such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting or otherwise as
      the directors may from time to time
determine.
              
            
        
      
       
      
        
            
              
                 
      
              
              
                5
              
              
                Subject
      to the provisions of the Act in this regard, and to authorisation by a
      resolution of the members in the case of Common Shares, shares may be
      issued on the terms that they are redeemable, or at the option of the
      Company be liable to be redeemed on such terms and in such manner as the
      directors before or at the time of the issue of such shares may
      determine.”
              
            
        
      
       
      The
Company’s board of directors recommends that Articles 3 and 4 be amended by
deleting the phrase “, subject to authorization by a resolution of members in
the case of Common Shares” and that Article 5 be amended by deleting the phrase
“and to authorization by a resolution of the members in the case of Common
Shares”.  As amended by this proposal, Articles 3, 4 and
5  would read in their entirety as follows:
       
      
        
            
              
                 
      
              
              
                “3
              
              
                Subject
      to the provisions of these Articles, the unissued shares of the Company
      (whether forming part of the original or any increased authorised shares)
      shall be at the disposal of the directors who may offer, allot, grant
      options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons at such times
      and for such consideration, being not less than the par value of the of
      the shares being disposed of, and upon such terms and conditions as the
      directors may determine.

      INCREASE
IN COMPANY’S AUTHORIZED SHARE CAPITAL
      
      The Company is currently
authorized to issue 50,000,000 common shares and 1,000,000 preferred
shares.  To provide sufficient shares for the future needs of
the Company, the board of directors believes that it is in the best interest of
the Company for the shareholders to approve an increase in the number of
authorized common shares from 50,000,000 to 150,000,000.  The board of
directors believes that the increase in the number of authorized common shares
is necessary to provide the Company with as much flexibility as possible to
issue equity securities for future transactions, including financing, capital
enhancement, acquisitions, share splits, share dividends, employee incentive
plans, and other similar purposes.
       
      Clause
7(a) of the Restated Memorandum currently reads as follows:

                The
      Company is authorized to issue a maximum of 51,000,000 shares

      AMENDMENT
OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION TO CLARIFY
      SHAREHOLDER
MEETING PROCEDURES
       
      Articles
22-26 of the Restated Articles provide the procedures for meetings of
shareholders.  The board recommends amending Articles 22, 24 and 26 to
clarify the rights and means by which a shareholder or its proxy may attend and
participate in meetings of shareholders and how the chairman is appointed, as
described below.  The board believes this will provide the
shareholders with greater ability to participate in meetings of shareholders and
clarity with respect to the appointment of a chairman for any
meeting.
       
      Articles
22-26 of the Restated Articles currently read as follows:

                No
      business shall be transacted at any meeting unless a quorum of members is
      present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business.  A
      quorum shall consist of the holder or holders present in person or by

      business shall be transacted at any meeting of members unless a quorum of
      members is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to

      present in person or by proxy entitled to exercise at least fifty (50)
      percent of the voting rights of the shares of each class or series of
      shares entitled to vote as a class or series thereon and the same
      proportion of the votes of the remaining shares entitled to vote

      PROPOSAL
5
      AMENDMENT
OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION TO ELIMINATE
      THE
CLASSIFICATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
       
      The
Restated Articles provide that the Company will have a classified board of
directors, with the directors divided into three classes and the number of
directors in each class being as nearly equal as possible.  The
Company’s directors are not currently divided into classes, and will not be
divided into classes at the annual general meeting.  The board
recommends amending Articles 39-41 to delete this requirement for a classified
board of directors of the Company. The board believes that eliminating this
requirement will eliminate undue procedures and requirements regarding the
composition and election of the board of directors and improve efficiency of
management.
       
      Articles
39-41 of the Restated Articles currently read as follows:
       
      
        
            
              
                 
      
              
              
                “39
              
              
                Subject
      to any subsequent amendment to change the number of directors, the number
      of the directors shall be not less than three or more than
      fifteen.  The Board of Directors shall be divided into three
      classes: Class A, Class B and Class C.  The number of directors
      in each class shall be as nearly equal as
  possible.
              
            
        
      
       
      
        
            
              
                 
      
              
              
                40
              
              
                The
      first director shall be appointed by the registered agent of the Company
      as a Class C director.  The Class C director shall then appoint
      additional Class A, Class B and Class C directors, as
      necessary.  The first directors in Class A shall be elected for
      a term expiring at the first annual meeting of the members,  the
      first directors in Class B shall be elected for a term expiring at the
      second annual meeting of the members, and the first directors in Class C
      shall be elected for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of the
      members.  Commencing at the first annual meeting of the members,
      and at each annual meeting thereafter, directors elected to succeed those
      directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to
      expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of the members after their
      election.  All directors shall hold office until the expiration
      of their respective terms of office and until their successors shall have
      been elected and qualified.  Election of directors need not be
      by ballot.
              
            
        
      
       
      
        
            
              
                 
      
              
              
                41
              
              
                Notwithstanding
      the provisions of Section 114 of the Act, each director holds office until
      his successor takes office or until his earlier death, resignation or
      removal by the members as per Article 40 or a resolution passed by the
      majority of the remaining
directors.”
              
            
        
      
       
      The
Company’s board of directors recommends that Articles 39-41 be deleted in their
entirety and replaced by the following:
       
      
        
            
              
                 
      
              
              
                “39
              
              
                Subject
      to any subsequent amendment to change the number of directors, the number
      of the directors shall be not less than two or more than
      fifteen.  The first director or directors shall be appointed by
      the registered agent of the Company.  Thereafter, the directors
      shall be appointed and removed by resolution of directors or resolution of
      members for such terms as the directors or members may so
      determine.  Sections 114(2) and 114(3) of the Act shall not
      apply to the Company.

                Commencing
      at the first annual meeting of the members, and at each annual meeting
      thereafter, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms
      expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third
      succeeding annual meeting of the members after their
      election.  All directors shall hold office until the expiration
      of their respective terms of office and until their successors shall have
      been elected and qualified.  Election of directors need not be
      by ballot.

Company’s audit committee recommends, and the Company’s board of directors
concurs, that the appointment of MSCM LLP by the Company’s audit committee as
the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2009 be ratified by resolution of the
shareholders.
       
      In the
event the Company’s shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Company’s
audit committee will reconsider its selection. Even if the selection is
ratified, the Company’s audit committee in its discretion may direct the
appointment of a different independent auditing firm at any time during the year
if the audit committee believes that such a change would be in the best
interests of the Company and shareholders.  Any such future selection
need not be submitted to a vote of shareholders.
       
      The
affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or represented
by proxy and voting at the annual general meeting will be required to approve
this proposal.
      
      THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RECOMMEND
      A
VOTE FOR PROPOSAL
6,
      THE
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF MSCM LLP
      AS
