MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

November 4, 2009

The following interim management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) updates our
annual MD&A included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, to which our
readers are referred. No update is provided where an item is not material or
there has been no material change from the discussion in our annual MD&A.

Forward-Looking Statements are outlined under the Outlook, Risks and
Uncertainties section of this press release. The major assumptions made in
preparing our second half guidance are outlined below and include, but are not
limited to:

- - Wholesale fertilizer prices through the fourth quarter of 2009 approximating
current benchmark prices;

- - Wholesale and Retail fertilizer sales volumes higher than levels in the same
quarter of 2008 reflecting the uncertainty that existed last fall;

- - Retail fertilizer gross margin percentages significantly above the 10 percent
realized in the fourth quarter of 2008 (including the impact of net realizable
value adjustments);

- - North American weather patterns providing for a fall fertilizer application
season of potentially lesser length when compared to recent years;

- - Chinese potash contract negotiations not settling in the fourth quarter of
2009;



- - Wholesale production volumes slightly lower than the same quarter of 2008 with
potash production operating significantly below capacity due to market driven
outages;

- - Urea sales price to Argentine growers approximating import prices rather than
a government capped price;

- - Average NYMEX gas pricing for the fourth quarter approximating $4.70/MMBtu;
and,

- - An effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 29 percent.

(1) See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 third quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

The major assumptions excluded in preparing our second half guidance are
outlined below, but are not limited to:

- - The exclusion from the guidance range of stock-based compensation expense with
a $1.00 change in stock price approximating a $0.01 change in earnings per
share;

- - The exclusion from the guidance range of mark-to-market gains or losses on
non-qualifying hedge positions settling in future periods; and,

- - Exclusion from the guidance range of earnings impacts relating to Agrium's
proposed acquisition of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ("CF") during the fourth
quarter.

2009 Third Quarter Operating Results

NET EARNINGS

Agrium's third quarter consolidated net earnings were $26-million, or $0.16
diluted earnings per share, compared to net earnings of $367-million, or $2.31
diluted earnings per share, for the same quarter of 2008. Consolidated net
earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were $336-million, or $2.13 diluted
earnings per share, compared to $1.2-billion, or $7.54 diluted earnings per
share, for the same period last year. Net earnings before interest expense and
income taxes ("EBIT") were $63-million for the third quarter of 2009 compared
with EBIT of $567-million for the third quarter of 2008. EBIT for the first nine
months of 2009 was $550-million compared with EBIT of $1.8-billion for the same
period last year. A reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings is provided in the
section "Non-GAAP Measures". Consolidated gross profit in the third quarter of
2009 was $397-million, a $651-million decrease compared to the third quarter of
2008. Consolidated gross profit in the first nine months of 2009 was
$1.6-billion, a $1.1-billion decrease compared to $2.7-billion for the same
period of 2008. The decreases in quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year EBIT
and gross profit were primarily due to lower selling prices for most products
and reduced potash sales volumes. For discussion on the performance of each
business unit, see section "Business Segment Performance".

Expenses were $159-million lower in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the
same period last year due to the absence of the significant losses on derivative
financial instruments which occurred in the third quarter of 2008, lower Retail
selling expenses from decreases in performance incentives and



lower potash profit taxes, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation
expense. Expenses were $173-million higher in the first nine months of 2009
compared to the same period last year due to significantly lower gains on
derivative financial instruments and an increase in Retail selling expenses
resulting from the inclusion of the UAP business since May 5, 2008, partially
offset by lower potash profit taxes.

The effective tax rate was 30 percent for the third quarter of 2009, relatively
unchanged from 31 percent for the same period last year. The effective tax rate
was 28 percent for the first nine months of 2009 compared with 32 percent for
the corresponding period in 2008. The lower tax rate was due to a higher
proportion of income earned in lower taxed jurisdictions in 2009 offset by
Canadian income tax on the foreign exchange gains related to our U.S.
dollar-denominated debt.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE

Retail

Retail's 2009 third quarter net sales were $1.2-billion, compared to
$1.6-billion in the third quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $254-million in the
third quarter of 2009, compared to $416-million for the same period last year,
while Retail EBIT was $31-million in the third quarter of 2009, versus EBIT of
$121-million in the third quarter of 2008.

Crop nutrient net sales were $345-million this quarter compared to $588-million
in the same quarter last year. The decrease was due to the significant decline
in crop nutrient prices across all products. While crop nutrient volumes this
quarter were similar to the same period last year, they were lower than
anticipated due to the late harvest in the Midwest United States. Gross profit
for crop nutrients was $31-million this quarter compared to the record third
quarter results of $160-million achieved in the third quarter of 2008. Crop
nutrient margins averaged 9 percent in the third quarter of 2009, unchanged from
the previous quarter and compared to 27 percent in the third quarter of 2008.
The reduction in margins and profit compared to last year was due to lower
overall crop nutrient prices, declining price environment for most products
during the quarter and the liquidation of high cost positions. We anticipate
crop nutrient margins to improve in the fourth quarter as fertilizer pricing
appears to have stabilized for nitrogen and phosphate, and higher cost
inventories have been depleted.(1) Sales volumes and margins in our South
American operations were also lower this quarter than the same period last year
due to fertilizer price depreciation and an approximate 50 percent decline in
planted wheat acres as a result of the severe drought.

Crop protection net sales were $768-million in the third quarter of 2009, a 12
percent decrease from the $874-million in sales for the same period last year.
This was due to lower volumes for fungicides and lower pricing for glyphosate
products. Gross profit this quarter was $169-million, a decrease of $22-million
over last year's $191-million. Crop protection product margins as a percentage
of net sales were 22 percent for the third quarter of 2009, unchanged from the
same period last year. The relative strength in earnings from this product line
in a difficult agricultural environment illustrates the benefits of the
diversity in our Retail business.

Net sales for seed, services and other decreased by 14 percent to $114-million
this quarter, from $132-million in the third quarter of 2008. Gross profit was
$54-million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $65-million for the same



period last year. Seed sales were $37-million in the third quarter of 2009, a
decrease of 29 percent over the same period last year. Gross profit from seed
sales were $7-million this quarter compared to $14-million in the third quarter
of 2008. Application services revenues were $48-million and gross profit was
$33-million this quarter, both lower than last year's strong results. This was
due to about a 40 percent decline in application of crop health products this
summer, resulting from the combination of lower crop prices and a sizeable
increase in plant health product prices.

(1) See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
2009 third quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section "Management's
Discussion and Analysis".

Retail selling expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were $200-million, a 15
percent decline over last year's level, primarily due to lower performance
incentives earned and reduced fuel and equipment lease costs. Selling expenses
as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2009 were slightly higher
on a quarter over quarter basis.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were $658-million for the third quarter of 2009 compared
to $1.6-billion for the third quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $133-million in
the third quarter of 2009, a $520-million reduction from the record third
quarter for 2008 of $653-million. EBIT of $83-million in the third quarter of
2009 was significantly lower than the $412-million earned in the third quarter
of 2008. The main factor impacting the quarter over quarter results were lower
sales prices across all three nutrients and lower potash sales volumes.

Nitrogen gross profit was $80-million this quarter, compared to $204-million in
the same quarter last year. Nitrogen prices were lower than last year across all
products for both benchmark and Agrium's realized prices. Domestic ammonia and
urea volumes were similar to third quarter of 2008, while our international
Profertil sales volumes were significantly higher than last year due primarily
to the impact of production outages in 2008. Nitrogen cost of product was $196
per tonne this quarter, significantly lower than the $351 per tonne in the third
quarter of 2008. The lower production cost was a result of lower North American
gas prices. Agrium's nitrogen margins averaged $87 per tonne this quarter,
compared with $243 per tonne in the third quarter of last year. Urea margins
were lower than last year but remained well over $100 per tonne this quarter.
Ammonia margins were lower than the previous quarter due to the greater
proportion of sales to industrial customers that occurs in the third quarter
relative to the second and fourth quarters.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $4.01/MMBtu (including gas hedging) in the
third quarter of 2009 versus $9.02/MMBtu in the third quarter of 2008. The U.S.
benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the third quarter of 2009 was
$3.41/MMBtu, versus $10.09/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $3.60/MMBtu
in the second quarter of 2009. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was
$0.69/MMBtu for the third quarter of 2009.

Potash gross profit was $56-million in the third quarter of 2009 versus
$202-million in the third quarter of 2008. The average sales price was $399 per
tonne this quarter, down from $655 per tonne for the same period last year.
Sales volumes were 273,000 tonnes, down 28 percent from the same period last
year. Both international and domestic demand remained significantly lower than
normal due to continued uncertainty in international markets and the cautious



approach to replenishing stocks by retailers and distributors in North America.
Cost of product on a per tonne basis was $194 per tonne or $71 per tonne higher
than for the same quarter last year due to lower operating rates resulting in
fixed costs being allocated over fewer sales tonnes, but this quarter's costs on
a per tonne basis were significantly lower than the preceding quarter due to
fixed operating costs being allocated over greater sales volumes. Gross margin
was $205 per tonne compared with $532 per tonne in the third quarter of last
year.

Phosphate gross profit was a loss of $1-million, compared to a profit of
$195-million in the same quarter last year. While sales volumes were higher than
the same quarter last year, realized sales prices averaged $368 per tonne,
compared to the record $1,321 per tonne price achieved in the same quarter last
year. Phosphate cost of product was $371 per tonne, or $137 per tonne lower than
the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower sulphur and ammonia costs
combined with lower rock costs at our Canadian production facility.

Gross profit for the Purchase for Resale business in the third quarter of 2009
was a loss of $13-million versus a gross profit of $31-million for the same
period last year. The majority of the quarter over quarter variance is due to
the significant drop in sales prices and sales volumes in our North and South
American businesses. This was offset partially by the profitability of our CMF
distribution acquisition.

Wholesale expenses were $204-million lower in the third quarter of 2009 than the
same period last year due primarily to a combined $165-million loss from natural
gas and power derivatives reported in the third quarter of 2008. The third
quarter of 2009 reported realized losses of $29-million and mark-to-market gains
of $31-million on the derivatives. This variance in derivative valuations was
also complemented by a decrease in potash profit and capital taxes of
$34-million from the same period in 2008, due mainly to lower potash sales
volumes and prices combined with tax credits received for higher capital
expenditures on our potash growth projects.

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' third quarter 2009 net sales were $60-million compared to
$90-million in the third quarter of 2008. Net sales and gross profit were
impacted by reduced volumes and margins in turf and ornamental due to lower
household expenditures and golf course budgetary cuts as a result of slower
economic growth. ESN (our controlled release product for broad acreage coverage)
net sales were 70 percent lower in the third quarter of 2009 when compared to
the same period in 2008. Sales volumes of ESN were 41 percent lower and sales
prices were almost 50 percent lower in the third quarter of 2009 due to
increased uncertainty and lower prices for UAN in particular.

Gross profit for Advanced Technologies was $11-million for the quarter, compared
with $25-million for the same period last year, while EBITDA was $4 million, a
decrease of $13-million versus the comparable period in 2008. The reduction in
EBITDA was due to weaker demand and margins for the turf, ornamental, and
agricultural products as a result of the depressed economy and fertilizer
market.

Selling, general and administrative costs for Advanced Technologies were
$2-million higher in the third quarter of 2009 when compared to the same period
in 2008. This was primarily due to the new turf and ornamental operations and
the relocation of the segment's corporate offices to Loveland, Colorado.


Other

EBIT for our other non-operating business unit for the third quarter of 2009 was
a loss of $51-million, a decrease of $75-million compared to earnings of
$24-million for the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in quarter-over-quarter
EBIT reflected an increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by an
increase in our share price in the third quarter of 2009 compared to a decrease
in the comparative period of 2008, partially offset by lower inter-company gross
profit eliminations. EBIT for Other for the first nine months of 2009 was a loss
of $34-million, a decrease in loss of $55-million over the loss of $89-million
for the same period of 2008. The change in EBIT for the first nine months of
2009 reflected the benefit of gross profit deferred on the sale of Wholesale
products to Retail in 2008 which was recognized when Retail sold these products
to external customers in 2009. This was partially offset by higher foreign
exchange losses for the 2009 nine month period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities was $229-million in the third quarter of
2009, compared with $300-million in the same period of 2008. Driving this
quarter-over-quarter change was a $341-million decrease in net earnings, a
$244-million decrease in unrealized losses on derivative financial instruments,
and a $132-million non-cash decrease in future income tax liabilities. This was
partially offset by a $124-million increase in stock-based compensation expense
and a $511-million increase in non-cash working capital where the decrease in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities was more than offset by reductions in
accounts receivable and inventory resulting from lower sales volumes and input
costs.

Cash provided by operating activities was $500-million in the first nine months
of 2009, a $127-million increase from the same period of last year. Driving the
year-over-year change was the unusually high change in non-cash working capital
in 2008 that occurred when inventory increased significantly reflecting the
price escalation that occurred in the agricultural sector in 2008, partially
offset by a $862-million decrease in net earnings and a $492-million non-cash
decrease in future income tax liabilities.

December 31, 2008:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cash used in investing activities decreased by $171-million due to lower capital
expenditures in the third quarter of 2009. Cash used in investing activities
decreased by $2.9-billion in the first nine months of 2009 due to the UAP
acquisition in the second quarter of 2008 and lower capital expenditures in the
first nine months of 2009.

We expect our total capital expenditures for 2009 to be in excess of 10 percent
lower than the $450-million previously disclosed in our 2008 annual MD&A, as we
have chosen to defer several projects and initiatives into 2010.



Cash used by financing activities was $164-million in the third quarter of 2009
compared with $8-million in the same period of 2008. Cash used in financing
activities was $291-million in the first nine months of 2009, compared with cash
provided by financing of $1.6-billion in the same period of 2008. The
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes reflected the issuance of
long-term debt and bank indebtedness of $1.2-billion used to finance the UAP
acquisition, a pay-down of our bank indebtedness in the first nine months of
2009, and funds received from non-controlling interests in the third quarter of
2008. These changes were partially offset by $240-million repayment primarily
related to EAgrium non-recourse debt in the third quarter of 2008.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently,
quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. Sales are concentrated
in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are
accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally occur after the
planting seasons in North and South America. In addition, our acquisition of UAP
on May 5, 2008 impacts the comparability of quarterly results.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 25, 2009, Agrium submitted a proposal to the board of directors of
CF to acquire all of the capital stock of CF for cash and Agrium shares at
$72.00 per CF share, or a total of approximately $3.6-billion, based on the
closing price of Agrium shares on February 24, 2009. Agrium would fund the cash
portion through available liquidity and committed financing. The board of
directors of CF rejected Agrium's proposal on March 9, 2009, and to date has
refused to engage in negotiations with Agrium respecting an acquisition.

On March 16, 2009, Agrium commenced an exchange offer for all of the outstanding
shares of CF (the "Offer"), pursuant to which CF stockholders would receive
$31.70 in cash plus one common share of Agrium for each CF share. The Offer is
subject to a number of conditions, including the negotiation of a definitive
merger agreement and regulatory approvals under Canadian and U.S. antitrust
legislation. The Canadian Competition Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission
(United States) are reviewing the transaction. On March 27, 2009, Agrium
announced an increase in the cash portion to $35.00, for an aggregate
consideration not to exceed $1.8-billion in cash and 50.2 million shares. On May
11, 2009, Agrium announced an increase in the cash portion to $40.00 for an
aggregate cash consideration not to exceed $2.01-billion. The CF board of
directors has rejected the Offer. The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire on
November 13, 2009, unless extended.

On October 18, 2009, Agrium entered into an agreement with Terra Industries Inc.
to sell a portion of Agrium's Carseland nitrogen facility to Terra, conditional
on the closing of Agrium's proposed acquisition of CF. Under the terms of the
Carseland transaction, Terra will pay Agrium approximately $250-million in cash
for 50 percent of the Carseland facility, or approximately 340,000 tonnes of
urea and over 60,000 tonnes of net ammonia on an annual basis and certain U.S.
assets. The purchase price for the 50 percent of Carseland is at a similar
forward multiple to that which Agrium is offering for CF. Agrium has also
entered into a conditional supply arrangement with Terra for a long-term,
competitively priced supply of approximately 175,000 tonnes of nitrogen products
from Terra's facilities. Agrium continues to believe this agreement will address
regulatory concerns under Canadian competition law in connection with its offer
to acquire CF. Agrium also expects to refile its Hart-Scott-Rodino notification
shortly with the FTC.


Agrium is fully committed to acquiring CF and intends to continue to press the
board of directors of CF to execute a mutually beneficial merger agreement for
our respective shareholders. Agrium has had extensive discussions with CF
shareholders, who have advised Agrium that they favour a combination between
Agrium and CF and want the CF board to engage in discussions with us. Agrium is
prepared to increase its Offer further if CF can demonstrate additional value.

On October 30, 2009, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) granted conditional
listing approval of the 50.2 million Agrium common shares to be issued in
connection with Agrium's proposed acquisition of CF, subject to customary
conditions. The listing of the Agrium common shares is not conditional on the
approval of such issuance by Agrium shareholders. During February 2009, we
acquired 1.2 million shares of CF at an average cost of $52.34 for the total
consideration of $65-million, the maximum allowed under FTC regulations. The
shares are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale financial
instruments with changes to the fair value being recorded in other comprehensive
income. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the CF shares was $107-million.

EGYPT NITROGEN PROJECT

In the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with MOPCO, whereby
MOPCO would acquire EAgrium and all related contractual obligations through a
share exchange. The share exchange was completed on January 26, 2009, which
resulted in our owning 26 percent of MOPCO. We account for our investment in
MOPCO in the Wholesale business unit using the equity method.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS ("IFRS")

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' Accounting Standards Board has
published its strategic plan for convergence of Canadian generally accepted
accounting standards with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board. The changeover date for Canadian publicly accountable
enterprises is January 1, 2011 and will require restatement of comparative
figures.

Agrium is currently in the design and development phase of its IFRS transition
plan. To date, progress remains on plan for a successful IFRS implementation.

At this time, the full impact of transitioning to IFRS on the Company's future
financial position and future operational results is not reasonably determinable
or estimable. We continue to assess the available transitional exemption options
along with the accounting policies under IFRS and the resulting impacts.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary
measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net
earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings
before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of performance
because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of
historical performance for the different business segments. Similarly, financing
and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all



business units on a basis that is meaningful for comparison with other
companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should
not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating activities
as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net earnings as
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

BUSINESS RISKS

The information presented on business risks on pages 85 - 90 in our 2008 Annual
Report has not changed materially since December 31, 2008.

CONTROLS & PROCEDURES

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Grain and oilseed prices were under pressure throughout much of the third
quarter due to favorable 2009/10 crop prospects in North America, leading to
crop yield prospects that are much higher now than early in the year. Despite
the second consecutive year of robust grain production, global grain inventories
are currently projected to remain relatively flat in 2009/10 because of
continued demand growth. Most economists forecast that global



economic growth will turn positive in the fourth quarter which is an additional
positive for grain and oilseed demand prospects.

Positive global economic indicators have contributed to higher commodity prices
over the past couple of months, which along with the delayed U.S. harvest, has
led to a recent increase in grain and oilseed prices. At current prices and
forecasted input cost levels, 2010 returns on most crop production budgets are
significantly higher than the outlook for 2009 a year ago.

The delayed harvest could delay purchases of crop protection products in the
fourth quarter of 2009 and impact retail crop nutrient sales volumes. However,
with an improvement in prospective crop margins in 2010 and increased U.S.
planted area due to land coming out of the Conservation Reserve Program, the
outlook for 2010 is positive. Analyst forecasts for U.S. corn and soybean area
in 2010 both exceed 2009 levels.

Recent demand from Pakistan and India has provided support to nitrogen markets.
Going forward there are several positive drivers that could impact the market,
including the recent reduction in offshore urea imports to North America which
has led to a relatively tight supply and demand balance. The Fertilizer
Institute (TFI) reported that North American urea inventories were 11 percent
below 2008 levels at the end of September. On the supply side, increased crude
oil prices will impact formula-based gas contracts in Western Europe, lending
support to the nitrogen floor price for the rest of 2009 and into 2010. UAN
supplies will increase in late November when new capacity comes on stream in
Trinidad.

A risk to North American nutrient demand for all three nutrients is the
significant delay in the U.S. harvest, which will delay and may severely limit
fall applications. Any significant reduction in fall applications is expected to
be largely made up for in the spring 2010 application season.

India has been a key driver to the global phosphate market throughout 2009.
Similar to nitrogen, buyers are cautious of taking positions, notably with
uncertainty surrounding the impact of Chinese phosphate exports at the lower
export tax beginning October 16, 2009. It appears that the domestic Chinese
phosphate prices are higher than global alternatives, which will limit the
export pressure. Going forward, a more stable price is likely to attract demand
late in the fourth quarter and early 2010 as South American buyers re-enter the
market. U.S. DAP/MAP inventories, according to TFI data were down 33 percent
from 2008 levels and 23 percent from the 5-year average at the end of September.
Though they were slightly higher than August inventories, inventories were the
second lowest since November 2007.

Spot demand for potash has continued to be slow, driven primarily by buyer
caution due to uncertainty surrounding new supply agreements with China. In
contrast, since a supply agreement has been put in place, India has been
importing a significant volume with over 800,000 tonnes arriving in September
alone. The TFI reported that North American potash inventories declined for the
third consecutive month and are down 15 percent from the peak in June 2009, but
remain more than double the 5-year average. There has been a significant
reduction in global potash demand in the past year, and the current low level of
demand is unsustainable. The major uncertainty to the potash market is the
Chinese supply agreement and analysts expect that once the uncertainty is
removed, significant latent demand will re-surface as the global distribution
system needs to be re-filled.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this press release constitute forward-looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and
uncertainties, including those referred to in the MD&A section of the
Corporation's most recent annual report to shareholders, which may cause the
actual results, performance or achievements of the Corporation to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements.

A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those
in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, CF's failure
to accept Agrium's proposal and enter into a definitive agreement to effect the
transaction, timing and final terms of completion of the proposed CF
acquisition, Agrium common shares issued in connection with the proposed
acquisition may have a market value lower than expected, the businesses of
Agrium and CF, or any other recent business acquisitions, may not be integrated
successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly
than expected, the expected combination benefits and synergies and costs savings
from the Agrium/CF transaction may not be fully realized or not realized within
the expected time frame, the possible delay in the completion of the steps
required to be taken for the eventual combination of the two companies,
including the possibility that approvals or clearances required to be obtained
from regulatory and other agencies and bodies will not be obtained in a timely
manner or will be obtained on conditions that may require divestiture of assets
expected to be acquired, disruption from the proposed transaction making it more
difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees and suppliers,
weather conditions, crop prices, the future supply, demand and price level for
our major products, capital costs being significantly different than projected,
including costs associated with major projects, future gas prices and gas
availability in key markets, future operating rates and production costs at
Agrium's facilities, the exchange and tax rates for U.S., Canada and Argentina
and any changes in government policy in key agriculture markets, including the
application of price controls and tariffs on fertilizers and the availability of
subsidies or changes in their amounts, the ongoing global financial conditions
and changes in credit markets; a potential inability for MOPCO to raise the
required capital or the failure of the Egyptian government to issue all
necessary approvals to complete the MOPCO expansion as planned, Egyptian and
Argentinean governmental and regulatory requirements and actions by governmental
