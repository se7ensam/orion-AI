ADVANTEST CORPORATION




AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
 

(1)  Accounting Principles, Procedures and the Presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements



(a)  Terminology, Form and Method of Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements


Advantest Corporation (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “Advantest”) prepares the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles, procedures, terminology, form and method of preparation required
in the United States of America in connection with its issuance of American Depository Shares as established under Accounting Research Bulletins (“ARB”), Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) statements, Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) and other relevant sources (collectively “U.S. GAAP”).
Advantest prepared the interim consolidated financial statements that accompany these notes in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in Advantest’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2009 except for changes
discussed in Note (2)-(b).
The interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all normal adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to provide a fair presentation of results for the interim periods presented.  This interim information should be read with the consolidated
financial statements in Advantest’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2009.
Subsequent events have been evaluated through July 31, 2009, which is the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued.



(b)  Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission


The Company became listed on the New York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2001 (local time) by means of an issuance of American Depository Shares, and has been filing a Form 20-F (equivalent to the Annual Securities Report in Japan) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
since the year ended March 31, 2002.  Advantest prepares the consolidated financial statements in its Form 20-F in accordance with U.S. GAAP.


(c)  Significant differences from the preparation of financial statements under Japanese GAAP


Of the accounting principles, procedures and method of presentation adopted by Advantest, the following is a brief summary description of the significant differences from the preparation of financial statements using the accounting principles, procedure and method of presentation under Japanese GAAP, as required
under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan:


(i)  Allowance for compensated absences
In accordance with SFAS No. 43, “Accounting for Compensated Absences”, an allowance is provided for the right of employees to receive compensated absences in the future.


(ii)  Accrued pension and severance costs
In accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”, the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair
value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation) of pension plans is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.


(iii)  Goodwill
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill is no

longer amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually.


(2) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices






  

(a)

Description of Business


Advantest manufactures and sells semiconductor and component test system products and mechatronics-related products such as test handlers and device interfaces.  Advantest also engages in research and development activities and provides maintenance and support services associated with these products.


Description of the business by segment is as follows:


The semiconductor and component test system segment provides customers with test system products for the semiconductor industry and the electronic parts industry.  Product lines provided in the semiconductor and component test system segment include test systems for memory semiconductors for memory semiconductor
devices and test systems for SoC (“System-on-a-Chip”) semiconductors for non memory semiconductor devices.


The mechatronics system segment provides product lines such as test handlers, mechatronic-applied products for handling semiconductor devices, device interfaces that serve as interfaces with the devices that are measured and operations related to nano-technology products.


The services, support and others segment consists of comprehensive customer solutions provided in connection with the above segments, support services, equipment lease business and others.








  

(b)

Accounting Change and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted


In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Advantest adopted SFAS 141R in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2009, which did not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.


In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement, an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent,
the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  Advantest
adopted SFAS 160 in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2009, which did not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, “Subsequent Events” (“SFAS 165”). SFAS 165 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or
are available to be issued. SFAS165 requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated, as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued. SFAS 165 is effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. Advantest adopted SFAS 165 in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2009, which did not have an impact on its financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 

Advantest maintains non-marketable investment securities, which are recorded at cost.  The carrying amounts of non-marketable investment securities were ¥3,646 million and ¥3,664 million at June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009, respectively. For non-marketable equity securities which Advantest identified events or
changes in circumstances that might have had significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investments, the fair value approximate the carrying value. Advantest has not estimated the fair value of other non-marketable equity securities of ¥1,726 million and ¥1,150 million at June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009, respectively, since it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the investments. It is because of the lack of readily determinable fair values and difficulty in estimating fair value
without incurring excessive cost.


(5) Derivative Financial Instruments


Derivative
Advantest uses foreign exchange forward contracts and currency options to manage currency exposure, resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, on trade receivables.  However, these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting since they do not meet the hedging criteria specified by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended.


Foreign exchange contracts generally have maturities of several months.  These contracts are used to reduce Advantest’s risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures.  Changes in fair
value of foreign exchange contracts are recognized in earnings under the caption of other income (expense).


Advantest does not, as a matter of policy, enter into derivative transactions for the purpose of speculation.


Advantest had foreign exchange contracts to exchange currencies among Japanese yen, US dollar and Euro at June 30, 2009 and March 31 2009. The notional amounts of these contracts at June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009 were as follows:

Concentration of credit risk
Derivative financial instruments contain an element of risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.  However, Advantest minimizes risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to major international banks and financial institutions meeting established credit guidelines.  Management
of Advantest does not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations and, therefore, does not expect to incur any losses due to counterparty default on its obligations.


Advantest generally does not require or place collateral for these derivative financial instruments.

(6) Fair Value Measurement


Disclosure about the fair value of Financial Instruments
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of Advantest’s financial instruments at June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009, except for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, other current assets, trade accounts payable and accrued expenses for which
fair value approximate their carrying amounts.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

The carrying amounts shown in the table are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the indicated captions.  And the carrying amounts of foreign exchange contracts are included in other current assets and other current liabilities.


The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments:


Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, other current assets, trade accounts payable, and accrued expenses (nonderivatives):  The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.


Available-for-sale equity securities:  The fair values of available-for-sale equity securities are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those investments.


Foreign exchange contracts:  The fair value of foreign exchange contracts are estimated by obtaining quotes from financial institutions.

Fair Value Hierarchy
SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three levels:


Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.


Assets/Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
As of June 30, 2009 and as of March 31, 2009, carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level is as follows:

The table does not include assets and liabilities which are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. Advantest’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value consist of available-for-sale equity securities and foreign exchange contracts. Adjustments to fair value of available-for-sale
equity securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) except where losses are considered to be other than temporary, in which case the losses are recorded in other income (expense). Changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts are recognized in earnings under the caption of other income (expense).


(7) Income Taxes
As of June 30, 2008, the estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2008 is approximately 59.4 percent. The estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2008 differs from the 40.4 percent statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effects of foreign tax rates and
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2009, the estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2009 is approximately (0.2) percent. The estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2009 differs from the 40.4 percent statutory income tax rate primarily due to the estimated net increase in valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets and the effects of foreign tax rates.
