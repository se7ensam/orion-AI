(Note) Revision of earnings forecast for this period: Yes
Advantest’s business focuses on test systems for semiconductors, and relies heavily on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, test houses and foundries.  The capital expenditures of these companies are determined primarily by factors such as current or future trends in the demand for semiconductors.  Semiconductor
market analysts predict growing demand for netbooks and notebooks, as well as desktop demand driven by the release of new operating systems in late 2009, and increasing demand for handsets compliant with next-generation high-speed wireless networks. Advantest plans to meet these market trends with a comprehensive range of products. However, it should be noted that semiconductor manufacturers, reorganizing their own businesses in response to a downturn in the global economy, are likely to continue taking a cautious
stance on capital investment.  Because of the great difficulty involved in forecasting earnings in such an operating environment, Advantest did not disclose the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 as of April 2009.  At this time, we are able to disclose the earnings forecast for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, taking into account trends in orders input received and other factors in the first quarter.  Such earnings forecast is
disclosed above.  As to the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, Advantest intends to promptly disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes possible.

In the first quarter, economic stimulus packages implemented by national governments in response to last year’s financial crisis began to take effect, easing pessimism on economic prospects, and reviving consumer goods markets, principally in developing countries. Signs of economic recovery were seen, especially in
China, where government intervention stimulated demand for consumer appliances such as flat-screen televisions, and in the semiconductor-related market, the adjustment to excess inventory and production expansion to meet demand boosted semiconductor manufacturers’ utilization rates.
However, higher utilization rates of production facilities have not yet triggered new capital investment, and impact of significantly reduced demand and consumption in the semiconductor industry remain pronounced, reflecting factors such as lower consumer spending. In this environment, manufacturers are maintaining a cautious
stance on capital expenditures, and demand for semiconductor test systems, Advantest’s main product, remains weak. Thus, even though orders input received for the first quarter increased sequentially (as compared to the prior quarterly period ended March 31, 2009) to (Y) 11.6 billion (a 35.9% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), the net sales environment continued to be challenging, leading Advantest to record net sales of (Y) 7.6 billion for the quarter (a 71.2%
decrease). The percentage of net sales to overseas customers was 74.0%, compared to 75.5% in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Advantest has made efforts to improve profitability, including structural reforms launched in fiscal 2008 and continued cost-cutting measures, but primarily due to weak net sales, Advantest recorded an operating loss of (Y) 4.5 billion and a loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated company of (Y) 3.7 billion
in the first quarter.

In the Semiconductor and Component Test Systems segment, semiconductor manufacturers’ cautious stance on capital expenditures sharply impacted Advantest’s results for both memory and non-memory test systems.
In the memory industry, some improvement was seen in weak markets, such as signs of investment in DDR3-SDRAM markets, and increased demand for flash memory for new mobile phones, but this did not amount to a broad-based recovery that would support investment in new semiconductor test system equipment for volume production.
In non-memory, while the market remained broadly weak, there was comparative strength in demand for test systems for next generation microprocessors used in PCs. But the recovery did not extend to the consumer and automotive segments that increasingly drive semiconductor sales, and capital investment in test systems for
automotive ICs, LCD driver ICs, and consumer ICs stayed at a low level.
As a result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 7.4 billion (a 26.0% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), net sales were (Y) 4.1 billion (a 76.1% decrease) and operating loss was (Y) 2.8 billion.

Semiconductor manufacturers’ continued reluctance in making new investments in test systems also affected demand for test handlers and device interface products, which are used together with test systems.
As a result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 1.7 billion (a 59.7% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), net sales were (Y) 1.4 billion (a 74.0% decrease) and operating loss was (Y) 1.0 billion.

This segment also experienced the impact of the weak demand for test systems, as well as a lower demand for maintenance services primarily due to lower equipment utilization rates at semiconductor manufacturing facilities, orders input received was (Y) 2.5 billion (a 40.2% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period
of the previous fiscal year), net sales were (Y) 2.2 billion (a 49.3% decrease) and operating income was (Y) 0.3 billion (a 37.9% decrease).


2.  Analysis of Financial Condition
Total assets at June 30, 2009 amounted to (Y) 190.0 billion, a decrease of (Y) 12.0 billion compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The amount of total liabilities was (Y) 31.2 billion, a decrease of (Y) 7.3 billion compared to March 31, 2009, primarily
due to decreases in other accounts payable and accrued expenses. Stockholders’ equity was (Y) 158.9 billion. Equity to assets ratio was 83.6%, an increase of 2.6 percentage point from March 31, 2009.


(Cash Flow Condition)
Cash and cash equivalents held at June 30, 2009 were (Y) 102.2 billion, a decrease of (Y) 3.2 billion from March 31, 2009. Significant cash flows during the first quarter of this fiscal year and their causes are described below.
Net cash used in operating activities was (Y) 11.2 billion. This amount was primarily attributable to net loss of (Y) 3.8 billion and decrease in other accounts payable due to the payments of early retirement program in the amount of (Y) 5.6 billion.
Net cash provided by investing activities was (Y) 9.0 billion. This amount was primarily attributable to decreases in short-term investments in the amount of (Y) 9.5 billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount of (Y) 0.5 billion.
Net cash used in financing activities was (Y) 0.9 billion. This amount was primarily attributable to dividend payments in the amount of (Y) 0.9 billion.


3.  Prospects for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
Semiconductor market analysts predict growing demand for netbooks and notebooks, as well as desktop demand driven by the release of new operating systems in late 2009, and increasing demand for handsets compliant with next-generation high-speed wireless networks. Advantest plans to meet these market trends with a comprehensive
range of products. However, it should be noted that semiconductor manufacturers, reorganizing their own businesses in response to a downturn in the global economy, are likely to continue taking a cautious stance on capital investment.
In this operating environment, Advantest will continue to seek improved results by focusing on developing products that meet customers’ needs and delivering them in a timely fashion. Adventest will also sustain its focus on cutting costs to enhance profitability.

Advantest DI Corporation was merged with Advantest Manufacturing, Inc. which is Advantest’s subsidiary on April 1, 2009.


(2) Use of simplified accounting method and special accounting policy for quarterly consolidated financial statements:
Tax expense is measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Advantest makes, at the end of the first quarter, its best estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and use that rate to provide for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis. The estimated effective tax rate includes the deferred
tax effects of expected year-end temporary differences and carryforwards, and the tax effect of a valuation allowance expected to be necessary for a deferred tax assets must be projected.


(3)  Changes in accounting principles, procedures and the presentation of the quarterly consolidated financial statements: None
