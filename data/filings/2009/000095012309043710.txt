<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Background to strategic review</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company announced on June&nbsp;25, 2009 that it would be late in filing its Form 20-F for the fiscal
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 (the &#147;2008 20-F&#148;) due to delays in completing the preparation of its
annual financial statements. The delays were caused by (i)&nbsp;two investigations being conducted at
the direction of the Audit Committee of the Company, one of which is in response to allegations
made by a former employee of Primalights III Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. (&#147;P3A&#148;), a
consolidated affiliated entity of the Company; and (ii)&nbsp;a delay in completing the valuation of the
Company&#146;s biological assets, including sheep and date trees, which is being conducted by an
independent valuation firm.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">While substantial progress has been made on the investigations led by the Audit Committee, the
investigations have not yet been completed in part as the investigators have not received full
cooperation from the current management of P3A. In addition, valuation of the Company&#146;s biological
assets is still ongoing, pending the adoption of appropriate valuation methods. This is in part
because P3A has not provided sufficient data necessary for certain valuation method for our sheep
inventory or explanations for

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">variations in useful life of date trees. As a result, the Company is not able to estimate at this
time when the investigations or the audit will be completed or when the 2008 20-F will be filed.
Nonetheless, the Audit Committee is proceeding with these investigations with the cooperation of
the senior management of the Company, who have indicated their intention to use their best efforts
to ensure that the Company files its 2008 20-F as soon as practicable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Scope of strategic review</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The changes in senior management being announced are part of the Company&#146;s efforts to review its
current business strategy and implement its new strategy with a top-notch, experienced team of
management. Upon joining the Company, Xie Tao will lead the management team to conduct a
comprehensive strategic review of the Company. This review will concentrate on developing and
implementing effective investment and growth strategies with the aim of enhancing the shareholders
value. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Xie and Mr.&nbsp;Boddington will lead the Company&#146;s ongoing efforts in pursuing
strategic acquisitions and alliances both in China and internationally.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr Alan Lai, Chairman of the Company, commented, &#147;I am delighted that the Company has been able to
retain the services of Xie Tao, who until recently was a senior partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers,
an international accounting and advisory firm. In his long career at PwC, he gained extensive
experience in helping both domestic and multinational companies in China to achieve a turnaround
when these companies found themselves in difficult situations. I am delighted to pass the important
responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer to someone with proven leadership qualities like
Xie Tao. I am committed to continuing to contribute to the Company as the Chairman of the Board by
drawing on my long, extensive business experience. I believe that with Mr.&nbsp;Boddington and the rest
of the management working alongside Mr.&nbsp;Xie, the Company will weather the challenging times and
emerge stronger in the future. Raymond Lo has provided loyal services to the Company and I am
pleased that he has agreed to remain involved in an advisory capacity.<I>&#148;</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Xie Tao, the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, commented, &#147;I am glad to take up this
position at this important juncture for the company. I appreciate the challenges the Company&#146;s
management is facing at this time and welcome the opportunity to lead a new team in addressing
these challenges. I believe we need to focus the core strategy on creating value for shareholders
and implement this strategy by taking advantage of high quality investment opportunities presented
within and outside China.<I>&#148;</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to joining Agria, Xie Tao engaged in advisory practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for 20
years where he led PwC China market corporate finance practice and served on the firm&#146;s governing
board. Mr.&nbsp;Tao has extensive experience in China related cross-border investments and M&#038;A and has
helped structured many well-known China businesses. Mr.&nbsp;Tao received his bachelor&#146;s degree in
physics from Beijing University in China and was a member of the UK Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Chris Boddington engaged in advisory practice at PwC for ten years with a significant amount of
time in China prior to joining Agria. Chris brings extensive experience in domestic and
cross-border transactions as well as business restructuring. Chris holds a bachelor&#146;s degree in
Aeronautical Engineering from Kingston Polytechnic and is an ICAEW Chartered Accountant.
