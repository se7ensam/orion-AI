<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>This management&#146;s discussion and analysis (&#147;MD&amp;A&#148;), of Alberta Star Development Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Alberta Star&#148;), &nbsp;dated March 6, 2009,<B> </B>&nbsp;should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements and notes for the year ended November 30, 2008. &nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). Except as noted, all financial amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars.</P>

rves and mineral resources, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, future prices of gold, silver, uranium and base metals, environmental risks and hazards, increased infrastructure and/or operating costs, labor and employment matters, aboriginal and government regulation and permitting requirements as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled &quot;Risk Factors&quot; in Alberta Star&#146;s latest Form 20-F on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C. Although Alberta Star has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Alberta Star disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking stateme
nts, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.</P>

<A NAME="_Toc224621611"></A><P style="margin:0px; font-family:TIMES NEW ROMAN BOLD" align=justify><B><I>OVERVIEW AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE</I></B></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Alberta Star Development Corp. is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of exploration properties in Canada&#146;s Northwest Territories (&#147;NT&#148;). &nbsp;The Company does not generate income or cash flow from its operations. The Company&#146;s outlook is dependent on the global demand for the minerals that it seeks on its properties, namely copper, gold, silver, cobalt, lead, zinc and uranium.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The Company carried out its Phase 3, 2008 Summer Exploration Drill Program at the Company&#146;s Eldorado-Glacier Lake permit area and Contact Lake permit area from June to August consisting of a seventeen (17) hole drill program. &nbsp;During the three month program, the Company completed over 2,600 meters of drilling. &nbsp;The Company&#146;s exploration team has combined the results from the 2006-2007 drill programs, which included one hundred and nineteen (119) drill holes completed, totaling more than 33,800 meters, with the results of the 2008 drill program. The 2006 &#150; 2008 drill programs total one hundred and thirty six (136) drill holes completed, totaling 36,400 meters. The summary geological report is being prepared and should be completed during the 2009 second quarter. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Effective June 23, 2008, the Company was granted two amended five-year Sahtu Land &amp; Water Board &#147;Class A&#148; Land Use Permits (Eldorado/Glacier Land and Contact Lake) for diamond drilling at both the Eldorado &amp; Contact Lake Projects. &nbsp;The amended Eldorado/Glacier Lake &#147;Class A&#148; Land Use Permit (Permit #S05C-012) is valid until April 26, 2013 and the amended Contact Lake &#147;Class A&#148; Land Use Permit (Permit #S05C-002) is valid until August 24, 2012. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Effective June 25, 2008, the Company appointed Dr. Michael Bersch as Chief Geologist. &nbsp;Dr. Bersch holds a PhD. in Geology from the University of New Mexico. &nbsp;Most recently Dr. Bersch served as Assistant to the Vice President for Research, Director of Central Analytical Facility, and adjunct professor of Geology at the University of Alabama, where he taught courses in economic geology, analytical instrumentation, and physical and historical geology. &nbsp;Dr. Bersch is a licensed professional geologist (Alabama), American Institute for Professional Geologists, a Fellow in the Society of Economic Geologists, and member of numerous other geological organizations. &nbsp;Dr. Bersch has extensive experience having worked in precious metals, base metals, uranium, and oil and gas exploration and development for 20 years on projects in the US, Australia, Canada and Latin America. &nbsp;Dr. Bersch was a &#147;hands-on&#148; project manager with two gold mining operations w
hich included the Golden Reward Mine located in South Dakota as VP of Exploration with Moruya Gold Mine NA, and the Pauper&#146;s Dream mine located in Montana and as Director and VP of Exploration with Pangea Resources Ltd. &nbsp;Dr. Bersch also holds a J.D. from the University of Alabama School of Law and is a member of the Alabama State Bar. &nbsp;Dr. Bersch served on the Investigation &amp; Enforcement Committee of the Alabama Board of Licensure for Professional Geologists which monitors the practices of Alabama licensed professional geologists. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>On July 14, 2008, the Company received a third permit approval from the Sahtu Land and Water Board (SLWB) for the issuance of a third &#147;Class A&#148;- 5 year 75,000 meter drill permit (#S07C-008) for its Eldorado South iron oxide, copper, gold, silver, and uranium project located in Canada&#146;s Northwest Territories. The Eldorado South permit (#S07C-008) is valid until July 10, 2013. &nbsp;The Company is now in receipt of the required drill permitting for its entire IOCG &amp; uranium landholdings consisting of 47,199.77 ha (116,633.17 acres) in the Sahtu Region.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Effective August 1, 2008, the Board of Directors approved the grant of 3,500,000 options to acquire common shares. &nbsp;Of these options 2,600,000 have been granted to directors, officers and investor relations consultants of the Company. &nbsp;3,400,000 options are exercisable at $0.35 per share and the remaining 100,000 options are exercisable at a price of $1.00 per share. &nbsp;All options expire on August 1, 2011, unless such options are earlier terminated in accordance with the Company&#146;s Stock Option Plan or TSX Venture Exchange policies.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>On September 5, 2008, Mr. Michael Bogin resigned his position on the Board of Directors and was replaced by Mr. Brian Morrison.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Effective October 10, 2008, the Board of Directors approved and adopted a shareholders rights plan (the &#147;Rights Plan&#148;) subject to shareholder and regulatory approval both of were received on February 3, 2009. &nbsp;The Rights Plan extends the minimum expiry period for a takeover bid to 60 days and requires a bid to remain open for an additional 10 business days after an offeror publicly announces it has received tenders for more than 50% of the Company&#146;s voting shares. The principle purpose of the Rights Plan is to ensure that all shareholders will be treated equally and fairly in the event of a bid for control of the Company through an acquisition of its common shares. &nbsp;It is designed to provide the Company shareholders with sufficient time to properly consider a takeover bid without undue time constraints. &nbsp;In addition, it will provide the board with additional time for review and consideration of unsolicited takeover bids, and if necessary, for 
the consideration of alternatives.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>On December 12, 2008, &nbsp;the Company completed a non-brokered private placement of &nbsp;2,333,333 flow-through units (&quot;Units&quot;) of the Company at a subscription price of $0.15 per Unit, for total gross proceeds of up to (Cdn) $350,000 (the &quot;Offering&quot;). Each Unit consists of one (1) common share issued on a &quot;flow-through share&quot; basis, in the share capital of the Company and one non flow-through common share purchase warrant (&quot;Warrant&quot;). Every Warrant is exercisable into one additional common share at an exercise price of $0.18 per share on or before December 12, 2010. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Effective December 17, 2008, Gord Steblin, was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Steblin has a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of British Columbia and is a Certified General Accountant with over 20 years of experience in the mining industry. &nbsp;The Company also announced the appointment of Edward Burylo to the Board of Directors. Mr. Burylo fills the vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Tracy Moore. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The Company continued staking several new and prospective iron oxide copper gold and uranium targets based on the Company&#146;s review of the results of the Company&#146;s Regional High Resolution Aeromagnetic Gradiometric-radiometric Survey over the Eldorado and Contact Lake uranium belts. &nbsp;Previously the Eldorado South uranium claims consisted of twenty four (24) contiguous claims and encompassed 19,627.66 hectares (&#147;ha&#148;) (48,501.04 acres). &nbsp;During the year ended November 30, 2008 the Company staked a number of new IOCG and uranium claims at the Eldorado South IOCG and uranium project increasing its land package to 25,892.19 ha (63,981.01 acres). &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The newly staked claims at the Eldorado South IOCG and uranium project include six (6) claims consisting of 6,264.53 ha (15,479.99 acres) and are situated on the northwestern extension of the 100% wholly owned Eldorado South claim block. &nbsp;The staking increases the size of the Eldorado South project to thirty (30) claims encompassing 25,892.19 ha (63,981.01 contiguous acres). &nbsp;The Eldorado south anomaly is over 3.5 kilometers (&#147;km&#148;) in length and the expression suggests a near surface uranium target. &nbsp;The Eldorado South uranium anomaly has never been &nbsp;drill tested. &nbsp;This recent staking increases the size of the Company&#146;s regional land portfolio to over 47,199.77 ha (116,633.17 acres).</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>In anticipation of the rapid escalation of fuel prices during the past year management secured advanced fuel delivery and storage for its 2008 summer exploration drill program Jet-B and diesel fuel needs in the fall of 2007. &nbsp;This resulted in significant fuel saving for the Company as well as a competitive advantage in forward planning and fuel logistics over other mineral exploration companies working in the Northwest Territories. &nbsp;Soaring fuel prices and rising exploration costs, combined with the deteriorating market conditions, continue to be of concern to exploration companies working in the north and the high costs have forced many companies to abandon their exploration projects or significantly reduce the exploration budgets to conserve their cash resources.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The Company currently plans to delay its 2009 exploration program due to unfavourable market conditions and high field costs. The Company intends to monitor and provide updates on its future exploration programs as market conditions change. The Company continues to reduce its overhead and look for additional avenues to conserve its working capital with the intent to continue to develop or acquire an economic mineral deposit. The Company has a strong balance sheet and no debt and is focused on cost cutting, maintaining qualified management and developing or acquiring economic projects. As a result of the global economic crisis, the Company expects there to be a serious shortage of available capital and exploration risk to the resource industry for a number of years to come, and the Company intends to manage its cash resources and review opportunities as circumstances demand.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>As a result of the current global economic recession, the Company has taken a series of initiatives aimed at cost reduction during this period of significant economic decline that has affected virtually every sector and every region of the world. &nbsp;The Company continues to complete due diligence reviews on a number of opportunities, including a number of advanced stage mineral exploration projects that meet the Company&#146;s corporate mandate of acquiring established resource opportunities with infrastructure, with cash flow or near term cash flow potential.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>As at November 30, 2008, the Company had working capital of $15,655,748, inclusive of $17,367,576 of cash and cash equivalents on hand. &nbsp;Cash on hand at the date of this MD&amp;A is approximately $16,700,000 which is sufficient to cover accounts payable, additional property acquisitions, planned exploration expenditures, and administration for at least 12 months.</P>

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The K2 target is an area in which drilling encountered IOCG style poly-metallic copper, gold, silver and cobalt mineralization. The mineralized zone is part of a regionally extensive zone of phyllic, potassic, hematite and magnetite, magnetite-actinolite alteration, often appearing at surface as phyllic-potassic pyritic gossans. The mineralization occurs within the same suite of volcano-plutonic rocks that host other poly-metallic mineralization &nbsp;in the Eldorado &amp; Contact Lake Mineral Belt, including the former El Bonanza Uranium-Silver (U-Ag) and the Eldorado Uranium (U-Ag-Cu-Co-Ni-Bi) mines.</P>

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The Eldorado South claims cover a radiometric anomaly that is over 3.5 kilometers in length and the expression suggests a potential near surface IOCG &amp; uranium target. &nbsp;The radiometric maps show a well defined uranium anomaly with a marked correlation of strong thorium (Th) and potassium (k) ratio patterns. &nbsp;The Eldorado South Anomaly has never been drill tested. &nbsp;The Eldorado South Anomaly was discovered in 2006 as a result of the completion of a High Resolution, Multi-Parameter Regional radiometric and magnetic geophysical survey which was conducted in July, 2006. &nbsp;The survey consisted of 16,708 line-kilometers at 100 meter line-spacing&#146;s. &nbsp;The purpose of the radiometric survey was to measure the gamma radiation field and locate prospective areas of high-grade uranium and poly-metallic deposition.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>In December 2007, the Deline Land Corporation passed a resolution placing a moratorium on any further uranium exploration and development on Deline District lands. &nbsp;The Deline Land Corporation has stated publicly and reiterated that all current agreements between the Deline Land Corporation and the Company would be fully honored. &nbsp;Several uranium mining moratoriums have been placed in several mining jurisdictions in Canada recently. &nbsp;They include a three year moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador (April 2008) and a moratorium issued in the Deline District (January 2008) in the Northwest Territories stating that they will not approve or consent to new uranium exploration or development until the 26 recommendations of the Canada-Deline Uranium Table have been addressed to the satisfaction of the leadership of the local community. &nbsp;The moratoriums do not apply to exploration for other minerals and mineral exploration activity is expected to continue in 
full force. &nbsp;</P>

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The preparation of the Company&#146;s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events. &nbsp;These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the determination of impairment of equipment, environmental and reclamation obligations, rates for amortization, variables used in determining stock-based compensation and assessments of control of variable interest entities. &nbsp;These estimates are based on management&#146;s best judgment. &nbsp;Factors that could affect these estimates include risks inherent in mineral exploration and development, changes in reclamation requirements, changes in government policy and changes in foreign exchange rates.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Management has made significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair market value of stock-based compensation granted to employees and non-employees and the value attributed to various warrants and broker warrants issued on financings. &nbsp;These estimates have an effect on the stock-based compensation expense recognized and the contributed surplus and share capital balances on the Company&#146;s balance sheet. &nbsp;Management has made estimates of the life of stock options and warrants, the expected volatility and expected dividend yields that could materially affect the fair market value of these types of securities. &nbsp;The estimates were chosen after reviewing the historical life of the Company&#146;s options and analyzing share price history to determine volatility.</P>

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Effective December 1, 2007, the Company adopted the new CICA Handbook Section 3862, &#147;<I>Financial Instruments &#150; Disclosures</I>&#148; and Section 3863, &#147;<I>Financial Instruments &#150; Presentation</I>&#148; which replace existing Section 3861, &#147;<I>Financial Instruments &#150; Disclosure and Presentation</I>&#148;, revising and enhancing its disclosure requirements, and carrying forward unchanged its presentation requirements. &nbsp;These new sections place increased emphasis on disclosure about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and how the entity manages those risks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>In 2001, the CICA issued Accounting Guideline No. 11, which covers the Company&#146;s exploration activities. &nbsp;In the past, the Company has capitalized certain exploration costs on mineral properties that were not covered by feasibility studies, whereas under the new guideline, the Company was required to expense these amounts in the year incurred. &nbsp;Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted these new recommendations on a retroactive basis. &nbsp;The impact as at January 1, 2001, of the adoption of these new recommendations was to reduce mineral properties by $561,257 and to increase deficit, accumulated during the exploration stage by $561,257.</P>

The new standard establishes revised standards for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of goodwill and intangible assets.

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><B>International Financial Reporting Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;)</B></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>In 2006, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (&#147;AcSB&#148;) published a new strategic plan that will significantly affect financial reporting requirements for Canadian companies. The AcSB strategic plan outlines the convergence of Canadian GAAP with IFRS over an expected five year transitional period. In February 2008 the AcSB announced that 2011 is the changeover date for publicly-listed companies to use IFRS, replacing Canada&#146;s own GAAP. The date is for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. The transition date of January 1, 2011, will require the restatement for comparative purposes of amounts reported by the Company for the year ended November 30, 2011. While the Company has begun assessing the adoption of IFRS for 2011, the financial reporting impact of the transition to IFRS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.</P>
