assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors,
and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the

operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal
proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating
internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion
