London, England - December 17, 2009 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock

Shareholders ("the Meeting") on December 17, 2009, agenda items 2 and 3 were
approved.

1 was not present and the Meeting was therefore not able to consider this item.

item 1. At such a meeting there is no requirement for a quorum.

The minutes of the Meeting detailing the resolutions proposed and the result of
the poll on items 2 and 3 are attached.

(Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg) of March 10, 1993, published in the Memorial C,
Recueil des Societes et Associations ("Memorial") of April 28, 1993, Number 190.
The Articles of Incorporation of the Company were amended several times and for
the last time by deed of Maitre Leonie Grethen, in replacement of Maitre Blanche
Moutrier of August 4, 2009.

The Extraordinary General Meeting was opened at 11 a.m. and presided over by Mr
Alistair Peel, Company Secretary, residing in the United Kingdom (the
"Chairman").

There was appointed as secretary Me Jean Hoss, lawyer, residing in Luxembourg,
and as ballot-judges Mrs Chantal Mathu and Mrs Celine Bonvalet, private
employees, residing professionally in Luxembourg. The Bureau having thus been
constituted, the Chairman declared and requested the Secretary to note that:

1.   it appeared from the main register kept by SERVICES GENERAUX DE GESTION
     S.A. and the Branch Register kept by DnB NOR Bank ASA of Oslo produced to
     the Meeting together with proxies duly filed within the statutory period
     that 68,686,198 Common Shares out of 194,953,972 issued Common Shares and
     183,126,035 outstanding Common Shares as at October 30, 2009 were
     represented.

2.   The notice of the Meeting was published according to the legal requirements
     in a Luxembourg daily newspaper and in the "Memorial C" on November 27,
     2009 and December 7, 2009 as evidenced by the documents presented to the
     Meeting and in accordance with article 26 of the Articles of Association
     (i) notice of this Meeting together with a proxy card, a letter of
     explanation and a business reply envelope have been mailed to the Common
     Shareholders on the Company's Registers as of October 30, 2009 and (ii)
     notice of this Meeting together with a proxy card, the letter of
     explanation and a business reply envelope were also mailed to the holders
     of American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (each of which represents one Common
     Share of the Company) on the register of Deutsche Bank Trust Company
     Americas, Depositary for the ADSs, as of October 30, 2009.

3.   In order to attend the present Meeting, the Common Shares represented
     complied with the legal and statutory requirements.

4.   The agenda of the general meeting is as follows:

     (1)  To approve the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
          to adopt amended Articles of Incorporation.

     (2)  To approve the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
          to appoint Mr Dod Fraser as a Director of the Company until the next
          Annual General Meeting or until his successor is appointed.

     (3)  To approve the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
          to adopt the Acergy S.A. 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

5.   The shareholders present or represented and the number of shares held by
     each of them are shown on an attendance list, signed ne varietur by the
     shareholders present or the proxyholders, the Chairman, the secretary and
     the ballot-judges, which will be attached to the present deed to be filed
     with the registration authorities. The said proxies, signed ne varietur by
     the Chairman, the secretary, and the ballot-judges, will remain attached to
     the present deed to be filed with the registration authorities.

6.   The present Meeting was therefore regularly convened and has the legal
     power to act on the items 2 and 3 of the agenda. Since a resolution on item
     1 requires a quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares, which is not present,
     the Meeting of Shareholders is thus not able to consider this resolution.
     The Board of Directors of the Company may call a second meeting of
     shareholders to consider item 1. At such a meeting there is no requirement
     for a quorum.

After this had been set forth by the Chairman and acknowledged by the members of
the general meeting, the Chairman submitted to the vote of the members of the
general meeting the following resolutions:

RESOLUTION 1 - Agenda item 2:

To approve the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company to
appoint Mr Dod Fraser as a Director of the Company until the next Annual General
Meeting or until his successor is appointed.

For:          58,097,205 shares
Against:      10,450,251 shares
Abstentions:  138,742 shares

The resolution was thus adopted.

RESOLUTION 2 - Agenda item 3:

To approve the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company to adopt
the Acergy S.A. 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
