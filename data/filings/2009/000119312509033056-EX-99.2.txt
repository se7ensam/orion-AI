 seabed-to-surface February 18, 2009 slide 2 Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this presentation may include “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E
of the US  Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements may be identified by
the use of  words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions.  The forward- looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties.  The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public 
filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among 
those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially from our 
forward-looking statements: the general economic conditions and competition in the 
markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the
 outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries;
uncertainties  inherent in operating internationally; the impact of laws and
regulations; and operating  hazards, including spills and environmental damage. 
Many of these factors are beyond  our ability to control or predict.  Given these
factors, you should not place undue reliance  on the forward-looking
statements.

 seabed-to-surface February 18, 2009 slide 16 Appendix – Adjusted EBITDA a)  Adjusted EBITDA:  The group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing
operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and  amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to  exclude investment income and
impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted  EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations.  Management believes that Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of
our operational strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing  operations have not been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as endorsed for use in  the European
Union.  These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as it eliminates the effects  of financing and depreciation.  Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be
a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by
shareholders and analysts following the group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing  operations as presented by the group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
other companies.  Such supplementary adjustments to  EBITDA may not be in
accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Accordingly, the SEC may
require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from  continuing operations be
presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and  Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with
IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net
income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the group’s operating results or cash flows from operations  (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the group’s liquidity.  The
reconciliation of the group’s net income from continuing operations to  Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this release.  This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from  continuing operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus
depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and
equipment.  Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in  line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer
group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those  evaluating
companies within Acergy’s industry.  Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above.  Adjusted  EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.
