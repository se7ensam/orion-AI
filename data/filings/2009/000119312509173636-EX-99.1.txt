Exhibit 99.1 -- Press Release

 

 Exhibit 99.1  

  AEGON to launch equity issue of up to EUR 1 billion   


•
 
 Intention to repay EUR 1 billion core capital obtained from Dutch State by December 1, 2009  AEGON aims to raise up to EUR 1 billion through an equity issue via an accelerated bookbuild beginning today. AEGON intends to use the proceeds of the equity issue to
repay up to EUR 1 billion of the total EUR 3 billion of core capital obtained last year from its largest shareholder, Vereniging AEGON, funded by the Dutch State. The decision to repay by December 1, 2009, is conditional on AEGON’s capital
position and the outlook for the economy and financial markets not deteriorating materially. The repayment further requires the formal consent of the Dutch Central Bank (DNB).  AEGON would effect the repayment by exercising its option to repurchase up to 250 million convertible core capital securities (CCCS) by December 1, 2009 at a price between EUR 4.00 and EUR 4.52 per
security depending on both the share price and timing of repurchase. Repurchasing by December 1, 2009 would permit AEGON to avoid having to pay EUR 6.00 per security after December 1, 2009. In addition AEGON would not be required to
pay future coupons of at least 8.5% per annum on the repurchased amount.  In order to raise EUR 1 billion, AEGON will use the authorization of the
annual shareholders’ meeting to issue new shares up to 10% of the issued common share capital and will issue such number of treasury shares as necessary. Accelerated book building for the equity issue will begin today. Vereniging AEGON is not
expected to take part in the offering. Vereniging AEGON is expected, however, to exercise the option to purchase additional class B preferred shares to preserve its share of voting rights.  “It has been our intention to repay the EUR 3 billion to the Dutch government at the earliest opportunity, provided it is both feasible and responsible to do
so,” said AEGON CEO Alex Wynaendts. “Our decision to issue equity in the amount of up to EUR 1 billion is the first step towards the goal of full repayment. AEGON’s current excess capital position of EUR 3.5 billion gives us the
flexibility to deploy capital in the business and puts us in a better position to work towards the goal of full repayment of the outstanding capital within the terms of our agreement with the Dutch State.”  J.P. Morgan will be acting as Sole Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner for the offering. ABN AMRO and BofA Merrill Lynch will also act as Joint Bookrunners. A
prospectus for the offering may be obtained from J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., 125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AJ, United Kingdom.  AEGON Group Corporate
