Agrium Reports Fourth Quarter Net Earnings of $124-Million and Record Year

CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - Feb. 11, 2009) -

ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$

Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today net earnings for the fourth
quarter of $124-million ($0.79 diluted earnings per share), compared with the
net earnings of $172-million in the fourth quarter of 2007 ($1.24 diluted
earnings per share). On an annual basis, 2008 was a record year for Agrium, with
net earnings of $1.3-billion ($8.34 diluted earnings per share) versus the
previous record of $441-million in net earnings ($3.25 diluted earnings per
share) set in 2007.

"Our fourth quarter margins were excellent again this quarter, even with the
challenges of reduced sales volumes and write-downs in inventories due to the
unprecedented changes in phosphate and nitrogen prices over the past four
months. We ended 2008 with earnings that were three times our previous record,
and our strong balance sheet and positive earnings outlook places us in an
excellent financial position for the future. Much of this success is a result of
our disciplined growth strategy of diversifying across the entire agricultural
value chain," said Mike Wilson, Agrium President and CEO.

"Despite the economic turmoil and uncertainty the world has been facing, we
believe that 2009 will prove to be a year where Agrium can again deliver strong
annual results. We believe the reduced crop nutrient use experienced over the
past four months is not sustainable and that it will ultimately impact grain
production and support crop prices and crop input demand. Recent growth
initiatives have positioned our Wholesale, Retail, and Advanced Technologies
businesses to continue to benefit from what we believe will be robust demand for
crop inputs in the coming year."

The fourth quarter results include non-cash foreign exchange gains of
$98-million (0.53 diluted earnings per share), non-qualifying natural gas and
power hedge losses of $87-million ($0.47 diluted earnings per share) and a
recovery in stock-based compensation of $36-million ($0.19 diluted earnings per
share). The results also include net write-downs net of non-controlling
interests totaling $261-million ($1.40 diluted earnings per share), primarily
related to changes in valuations of Wholesale inventory and Retail purchase
commitments.

KEY RESULTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

- -    Cash generated from operations was $671-million this quarter. Net earnings
     before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset
     impairment ("EBITDA") for the year was a record $2.3-billion due to strong
     results across all business units. EBITDA for the quarter was a
     fourth-quarter record of $306-million, while consolidated EBITDA excluding
     inventory write-downs was $522-million.

<PAGE>

- -    Wholesale per tonne margins for all three nutrients were excellent again
     this quarter, remaining at or above the 2008 average and illustrating our
     competitive advantages, particularly in nitrogen and phosphate. The start
     of the spring application season in most of the U.S. is still a few months
     away, but we expect a strong spring season, particularly for nitrogen.

- -    The final share swap for the MOPCO nitrogen facility was finalized on
     January 26, 2009, providing Agrium with a 26 percent interest in this
     existing facility. We took a $45-million write-down net of non-controlling
     interests to our $295-million EAgrium investment in the fourth quarter of
     2008 to reflect the difference in the estimated fair value of our MOPCO
     equity interest and the cost of our investment in EAgrium.

2008 Fourth Quarter Operating Results

NET EARNINGS

Agrium's fourth quarter consolidated net earnings were $124-million, or $0.79
diluted earnings per share, compared to net earnings of $172-million, or $1.24
diluted earnings per share, for the same quarter of 2007. Net earnings before
interest expense and income taxes ("EBIT") was $172-million for the fourth
quarter of 2008 compared with EBIT of $250-million for the fourth quarter of
2007. The decrease in EBIT was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from
an inventory write-down and an investment write-down for our EAgrium investment,
as well as certain material items noted below.

Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $522-million,
slightly lower compared to $533-million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Contributions from the UAP business and increase in fertilizer selling prices,
partially offset by a $93-million write-down primarily associated with future
inventory purchase commitments, resulted in a $49-million increase in gross
profit in our Retail business segment. Wholesale gross profit decreased
$60-million due to a decrease in sales volume and a $121-million write-down of
inventory for our purchase for resale business, partially offset by higher
selling prices. Our Advanced Technologies business segment contributed an
additional $2-million increase to the change in our quarter-over-quarter gross
profit. In accordance with our accounting standards, we referenced the current
and expected future market conditions at December 31, 2008 and made write-downs
on our inventory and future purchase commitments.

Expenses have increased $117-million quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting
a combination of the following items:

- -    $115-million increase in Retail's selling expense resulting in Retail's
     selling expense of $242-million primarily as a result of the addition of
     the UAP business;

- -    $90-million increase in losses on non-qualifying derivative positions
     resulting in a $87-million hedging loss;

- -    $87-million write-down in our EAgrium investment before non-controlling
     interests of $42-million, resulting in a net write-down to Agrium of
     $45-million;

<PAGE>

- -    $28-million increase in Potash profit and capital tax resulting in a
     $37-million expense driven by increased potash sales margins;

- -    $86-million decrease in stock-based compensation expense resulting in a
     $36-million recovery of stock-based compensation driven by a decrease in
     our share price; and

- -    $96-million increase in foreign exchange gains primarily related to the
     weakening of the Canadian dollar, resulting in $98-million of foreign
     exchange gain.

The effective tax rate was 15 percent for this quarter and 31 percent for the
year. The decline in the rate compared to the same quarter last year was
principally due to foreign exchange losses for Canadian tax purposes on our U.S.
dollar denominated debt resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar
during the quarter.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PEFORMANCE

Retail

Retail results are not directly comparable to the same period last year due to
the inclusion of UAP, which was acquired in May of 2008. Retail's 2008 fourth
quarter net sales were $1-billion, which almost doubled the $555-million in the
fourth quarter of 2007. Gross profit was $228-million in the fourth quarter of
2008, which included a $93-million write-down primarily for purchase commitments
of crop nutrients, compared to gross profit of $179-million for the same period
last year. While gross profit was $49-million higher this quarter than the same
period last year, Retail EBIT was lower due to higher expenses associated with
the acquired infrastructure of the UAP business. Retail EBIT was a loss of
$54-million in the fourth quarter of 2008, after the inventory write-down,
versus a positive EBIT of $39-million in the same quarter last year.

The UAP acquisition contributed $92-million in gross profit and $(19)-million in
EBIT for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the write-down in Retail
crop nutrients. This represents an increase of 80 percent in gross profit, and a
significant improvement in EBIT compared to a similar 13-week period in 2007,
given that UAP historically has EBIT losses in the fourth quarter. Agrium's
legacy Retail operations gross profit rose by 27 percent, or $50-million, over
the same period last year, while EBIT from legacy operations was 49 percent
higher than the same period last year, before taking into account the impact of
the write-down.

The increase in net sales and gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus
the same quarter of 2007 was attributed to:

Crop nutrients net sales reached $631-million this quarter, an increase of
$238-million compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, due to the addition of UAP
business and higher average selling prices. Gross profit was $60-million this
quarter compared to $83-million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease was
due entirely to a $93-million write-down resulting principally from changes in
valuations of future purchase commitments. This resulted in crop nutrients
margins declining to 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 21
percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the write-down, nutrient
margins would have been 24 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, slightly
higher compared to the same period last year. Nutrient sales

<PAGE>

volumes in the fourth quarter declined slightly compared to the same period last
year, even with the addition of UAP's nutrient business. Nutrient sales volumes
at Agrium's legacy North American operations declined by 46 percent compared to
the same period last year due to the deferral of crop nutrient applications from
the fall of 2008 into 2009 and the late harvest in the Cornbelt. Sales volumes
at our South American operations were also significantly lower this quarter than
the same period last year due to dry conditions in Argentina, the reduction in
global crop prices leading up to their planting season and uncertainty over
future government agricultural policies.

Crop protection net sales increased to $288-million this quarter, compared to
$87-million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our gross profit this quarter reached
$133-million, more than double last year's level. The strength of earnings from
this product line illustrates the benefits of the diversity in our Retail
business. Most of the increase in sales and profits was due to the addition of
UAP's significant crop protection business, including a broad range of private
label products. Crop protection product margins were 46 percent for the fourth
quarter of 2008 versus 64 percent for the fourth quarter of 2007. The decline in
margins compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the inclusion
of UAP's lower margin crop protection wholesale business and the timing and
nature of UAP supplier rebates.

Net sales for seed, services and other increased to $103-million this quarter,
up from $75-million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Gross profit was $35-million
in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $40-million for the same period last
year. The reduction in gross profit this year was primarily due to lower sales
of wheat seed compared to the strong demand last fall and charges associated
with the discontinuation of our Vigoro private label seed brand in order to
concentrate sales under the Dynagro private label brand previously sold only by
UAP. Seed net sales were $44-million this quarter, with sales from both our
legacy and UAP operations decreasing compared to the same period last year.

Retail selling expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $242-million, almost
double last year's level. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the
fourth quarter of 2008 were 24 percent, relatively unchanged from 23 percent for
the same period last year.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were a fourth-quarter record of $982-million for the
fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $908-million for the fourth quarter of 2007.
The increase was due to higher sales prices for all three crop nutrients, which
more than offset the decrease in sales volumes for all nutrients compared to the
same period last year. The decrease in sales volumes in the fourth quarter of
2008 were primarily due to: the significant reduction in domestic nutrient sales
volumes resulting from a condensed fall application season as a result of the
late harvest across most of North America; the expectation by growers that crop
nutrients prices would be lower in the spring of 2009 than the fall of 2008;
and, uncertainty created by the rapid changes in crop prices in the fall of
2008. Looking forward, we anticipate strong application rates for all nutrients
in the U.S. this spring, with particular strength in the demand for nitrogen
products and some recovery in nitrogen pricing.

<PAGE>

Gross profit was $283-million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a $60-million
reduction from the $343-million recorded for the same period last year.
Excluding the $121-million inventory write-down in our purchase for resale
business, total gross profit from our production facilities was higher than last
year. EBIT of $106-million in the fourth quarter of 2008 was also lower than the
$277-million for the same period last year due primarily to an inventory
write-down, an increase in operating expenses as noted below, and a $45-million
impairment of our interest in nitrogen facility assets in Egypt net of
non-controlling interests.

Gross profit for nitrogen was $136-million this quarter, compared to
$211-million in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen prices and margins remained
higher than the same period last year but a significant reduction in sales
volumes resulted in lower overall gross profit compared to the fourth quarter of
2007. Cost of product was $317 per tonne this quarter, a $93 per tonne increase
over the same period last year partly due to the inclusion of $11 per tonne in
depreciation this quarter, production shutdowns and curtailments, and higher gas
costs partly due to a higher proportion of production and sales coming from our
domestic rather than international nitrogen operations. The rapid decline in
North American gas costs in the later part of the fourth quarter of 2008 was not
reflected in our average gas cost this quarter due to higher cost of product
drawn from inventory. Both domestic ammonia and urea sales volumes were
approximately 32 percent below the previous year. The reduced volumes were due
to the delayed harvest and the grower's decision to defer nutrient application
from 2008 into 2009. International nitrogen sales volumes were 228,000 tonnes
lower than the same quarter last year due to the closure of the Kenai nitrogen
facility, the extended turnaround at our Argentine facility, and low nutrient
demand in South America. Agrium's nitrogen margins averaged $197 per tonne this
quarter, compared with $162 per tonne in the fourth quarter of last year, but
were $46 per tonne lower than the third quarter of 2008 due to lower realized
prices given the significant reduction in benchmark nitrogen prices in the
fourth quarter.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $7.41/MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2008
versus $5.68/MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2007. The U.S. benchmark (NYMEX)
natural gas price for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $6.82MMBtu, versus
$7.03/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $10.09/MMBtu in the third quarter
of 2008. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was $0.98/MMBtu for the fourth
quarter of 2008.

Gross profit for our phosphate operations was the third highest quarter on
record at $86-million, compared to $47-million for the same quarter last year.
Realized sales prices remained strong again this quarter at $1,117 per tonne,
due in large part to forward sales made earlier in the year. This price was more
than double the $523 per tonne achieved in the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales
volumes were 48 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Phosphate cost of
product on a per tonne basis was $489 per tonne, a $143 per tonne increase over
the same period last year but slightly lower than the third quarter of 2008. The
increase in cost over the same period last year was due to $36 per tonne of
depreciation expenses and higher sulphur and ammonia costs. Gross margins for
phosphate were $628 per tonne compared with $177 per tonne in the fourth quarter
of 2007. Benchmark phosphate prices declined by over 70 percent between the
start and end of the fourth quarter of 2008.

<PAGE>

Gross profit for potash increased significantly to $159-million versus
$57-million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Potash accounted for 42 percent of
Wholesale's gross profit from manufactured product. Realized selling prices were
more than triple last year's levels. The higher sales prices more than offset a
39 percent decrease in sales volumes and higher production costs. Sales volumes
decreased by 179,000 tonnes compared to the same period last year with
international and domestic sales volumes declining by 41 percent and 37 percent,
respectively. Global tightening of credit availability impacted international
demand in the fourth quarter, while domestic volumes were primarily impacted by
the late harvest and purchase deferrals. Cost of product was down 6 percent from
the third quarter of 2008 but was $38 per tonne higher than the same period last
year, due in part to higher equipment repair expense and a $13 per tonne
depreciation expense included in the cost of product. Gross margin on a per
tonne basis rose to $562 per tonne compared with $123 per tonne in the fourth
quarter of last year.

Net sales for product purchased for resale was double last year's levels.
However, gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $122-million lower than
the same period last year due in part to a $121-million inventory write-down,
caused by anticipated lower nutrient sales prices for inventories that will be
carried over from the fall of 2008 to the spring of 2009. Adjustments to
inventory valuations were required for product purchased for resale within North
America, Europe and Argentina.

Wholesale operating expenses (gross profit less EBIT) were $177-million in the
fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of $111-million over the same period last
year. This change was due to an increase in net mark-to-market losses of
$64-million from natural gas, power and foreign exchange derivatives;
$26-million increase in realized losses on non-qualifying natural gas and power
derivatives; and, an increase in Potash profit and capital taxes of $28-million
driven by increased potash margins. This was partially offset by a decrease in
stock-based compensation expense of $19-million.

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' fourth quarter 2008 net sales were $76-million compared
to $70-million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Gross profit was $17-million for
the quarter, compared with $15-million for the same period last year, while EBIT
increased by $8-million over the fourth quarter of 2007. These strong results
were achieved despite some challenges in the turf and ornamental business
resulting in a $2-million inventory write-down. ESN(R) gross profit in the
fourth quarter represented 44 percent of Advanced Technologies' gross profit,
slightly higher than the same period last year. Similar to other crop nutrient
volumes, ESN(R) sales volumes this quarter were significantly lower than the
fourth quarter of 2007 however this was more than offset by higher margins. On a
combined basis our other acquired businesses excluding ESN(R) gross profits are
at similar levels to the same quarter last year and are $6-million higher for
the year, despite some challenges from the non-agricultural market resulting
from the significant downturn in the economy. Cost of product included
$1-million of depreciation for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $7-million for the
year. Depreciation was not included in cost of product in 2007. The Reese
micronutrient facility, acquired from our Wholesale operations at the beginning
of the fourth-quarter 2007, contributed $1-million in gross profit this quarter
and $6-million for the year.

Other

<PAGE>

EBIT for our Other non-operating business segment for the fourth quarter of 2008
was $114-million compared to a loss of $64-million for the fourth quarter of
2007. The increase in EBIT of $178-million quarter-over-quarter is mainly due to
an increase in foreign exchange gain of $116-million as a result of the
weakening of the Canadian dollar and a significant decrease in stock-based
compensation expense of $67-million, driven by the decline in our share price in
the fourth quarter of 2008.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY

Cash provided by operating activities was $671-million in the fourth quarter of
2008, of which $238-million was an improvement in non-cash working capital over
the third quarter of 2008. Accounts receivable decreased by $1.1-billion, due
primarily to the reduction in sales over the prior quarter, a $200-million draw
on our accounts receivable securitization facility, and a reduction in Retail
rebates receivable as the majority of supplier rebates were received in the
fourth quarter. As our customers have generally indicated that they have not had
significant difficulty in obtaining credit, we anticipate collection performance
on accounts receivable to be within normal parameters. Inventories increased by
$461-million, primarily due to reduction in sales volumes over the prior
quarter, partially offset by a $121-million inventory write-down for Wholesale.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $64-million due to a
reduction in Wholesale customer prepaid sales and trade payables from decreased
market demand, lower inventory purchases and plant turnaround costs previously
accrued in the third quarter and paid in the fourth quarter. This was partially
offset by Retail write-down on future inventory purchase commitments and
seasonal increases in customer deposits.

Cash used in investing activities was $124-million for the fourth quarter of
2008, which included $91-million on capital expenditures.

Cash used in financing activities was $381-million during the quarter due to a
pay-down of our bank indebtedness as a result of lower financing required for
reduced working capital, repayment of long-term debt, as well as funds used for
share repurchase. As at December 31, 2008, Agrium repurchased

Egypt Nitrogen Project

On August 11, 2008, we entered into an agreement with MOPCO, whereby MOPCO would
acquire EAgrium and all related contractual rights and obligations through a
share exchange and Agrium will own 26 percent of MOPCO as a result. The share
exchange was completed on January 26, 2009. Since we do not control MOPCO on
completion of the agreement, we will cease consolidation of Egypt operations and
will record our investment using the equity method. MOPCO has commenced
commercial production at its 675,000 tonne urea facility and plans to construct
two additional urea trains on its existing site subject to securing sufficient
financing, which is not assured in the current environment.

The fertilizer and agricultural retail businesses are seasonal in nature.
Consequently, quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. For
purposes of comparison, fertilizer sales volumes are best measured on a
half-year basis, corresponding to the post-harvest application and the spring
planting application seasons.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary
measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net
earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings
before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of performance
because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of
historical performance for the different business segments. Similarly, financing
and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all business segments on a
basis that is meaningful for comparison with other companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should
not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating activities
as determined in accordance with GAAP.

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

There is a high degree of uncertainty about growers' cropping decisions for the
spring of 2009 within North America. Grower cash margins remain historically
strong for most grains and oilseeds, despite crop prices retreating from their
summer highs. The drought conditions in Argentina and lower fertilizer use
within Brazil this year due to tight credit conditions are expected to impact
South American crop yields which may lend further support to crop prices.
Volatile market conditions in the fall of 2008, combined with a delayed corn
harvest, contributed to U.S. winter wheat growers planting over 4 million fewer
wheat acres this year. Given current crop prices there is continued economic
incentive to optimize yields in the upcoming crop season.

Demand for crop protection products, seed and application services by North
American growers is expected to be strong in the spring of 2009. We anticipate
solid demand for most crop protection products again this year, with potential
for some further price increases in a number of crop protection products,
excluding glyphosate. The late North American harvest reduced crop input
application services in the fall of 2008 and demand is expected to be robust as
grower's attempt to catch-up this spring. Seed sales are expected to be strong
as well, as new seed varieties with multiple traits have been introduced again
this year, which are expected to support higher seed prices in 2009.

<PAGE>

The nitrogen market faced significant downward pressure in the fourth quarter of
2008, but has shown some improvement over the past month. Reduced demand in the
fourth quarter as a result of unprecedented purchase deferrals contributed to a
significant build in nitrogen inventories. The Fertilizer Institute reported
that North American urea inventories at the end of December 2008 were 83 percent
higher than the previous five year average. U.S. urea imports in the fourth
quarter of 2008 are estimated to be down over 30 percent. The increased
inventory levels, coupled with prices below European production costs and a
natural gas supply dispute between Ukraine and Russia all led to the curtailment
of over 10 percent of global urea capacity, excluding any undisclosed
under-utilized capacity.

We expect U.S. nitrogen demand to be strong this spring given the reduction in
use in the fall of 2008 and the fact that lower nitrogen application rates have
a more immediate impact on crop yields than for phosphate or potash. India will
continue to be a significant factor in 2009 as analysts forecast urea imports
may increase by 20 percent over 2008 levels as they attempt to replenish stocks.
China has re-imposed prohibitive export tariffs on urea beginning in February,
2009 but future actions by the Chinese government will remain an uncertainty for
the market.

North American potash inventories were at historically low levels throughout
most of 2008, but began to rise in the fourth quarter of the year as buyers
postponed purchases, partly resulting from reduced global credit availability.
International and domestic potash demand is expected to start improving in the
spring of 2009, after significant purchasing delays in many importing regions of
the world in the second half of 2008. North American potash inventories in
December of 2008 were 22 percent above the five year average. Contract renewals
at prevailing spot prices in both Japan and South Korea supported potash prices
through the end of the year and into 2009.

The outlook for global potash demand will be impacted by the relative strength
of crop prices, farmer economics and credit availability, and any progress on
contract negotiations between China and India and their key suppliers for 2009.
The majority of China's potash supply contracts expired at the end of 2008 and
negotiations are expected to continue through the first quarter of 2009. Similar
to the other two nutrients, global potash supplies were reduced significantly
starting in the fourth quarter of 2008 and into early 2009, due to global
production curtailments as a result of delayed purchases from major importers.
It is estimated that at the beginning of the year, over 30 percent of global
potash production was curtailed. We anticipate spring demand for potash to
improve compared to last fall, but it is difficult to indicate the extent of the
improvement.

Many of the market variables and conditions are similar for all three nutrients.
For phosphate, reduced demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in a
building of inventories. The TFI reported that U.S. DAP and MAP inventories at
the end of December were 86 percent higher than the previous five year average.
U.S. DAP and MAP production in the fourth quarter of 2008 was 41 percent lower
than a year ago. U.S. phosphate producers contribute approximately 35 percent of
global DAP and MAP trade. Reduced export demand in the fourth quarter resulted
in increased inventories, which pressured phosphate producers to significantly
lower their operating rates starting in the fourth quarter of 2008. At the
beginning of 2009, capacity equivalent to at least 30 percent of global DAP and
MAP demand was shut-down globally.
