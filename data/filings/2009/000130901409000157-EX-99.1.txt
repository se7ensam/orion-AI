Ballard Reports 2008 Financial Results


For Immediate Release – March 3, 2009


VANCOUVER, CANADA – Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDP) announced its financial results
for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2008 today. All amounts are in U.S.

FULL YEAR 2008 FINANCIAL RESULTS


In 2008, revenues were $59.6 million, representing a 9% decline from $65.5 million in 2007 and
meeting the revised guidance range of $58 to $64 million. However, adjusting for light-duty
automotive engineering development revenue of $1.6 million in 2008 and $15.8 million in 2007, which
relates to the business sold to AFCC, pro forma revenues increased $8.2 million, or 17%, compared
to 2007.


Product and service revenues totaled $52.7 million, an increase of $9.4 million, or 22% compared
with 2007. An $8.8 million increase in product revenues to $38.2 million was driven by higher
shipments of bus, material handling, light-duty automotive and backup power fuel cell products,
partially offset by lower shipments of residential cogeneration and material products. The decline
in residential cogeneration product sales was expected due to the introduction in 2008 of a new
lower cost product combined with the delivery of fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies instead of
fuel cell stacks, as the fuel cell stacks are now assembled in Japan by Ballard’s joint venture,
EBARA BALLARD. The decline in carbon fiber products was due to the effects of a labor strike that
affected a key customer in the first half of 2008 and the unprecedented weakness in the U.S.
automotive industry. Service revenues increased $0.5 million due to new testing and engineering
services provided to AFCC, partially offset by a decline in field service for fuel cell buses.
Engineering development revenue totaled $6.9 million, a decline of $15.3 million from 2007
primarily due to the elimination of automotive fuel cell program work subsequent to the closing of
the automotive transaction on January 31, 2008.


Lower gross margins were driven by larger reductions in warranty provisions for 2007 compared to
2008, more aggressive product pricing and enhanced warranty coverage on material handling products
in order to encourage market adoption, declines in field service revenues for fuel cell buses,
declines in service revenue and higher program expenditures on Power Generation non-recurring
engineering government contracts, and lower volumes of carbon fiber products due to the effects of
a labor strike affecting a key customer and the slow down in the U.S. automotive industry. These
declines were only partially offset by increased margins as a result of new testing and engineering
services provided to AFCC and the commencement of shipments of fuel cell bus modules related to the
B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus project.


Operating expenses declined $29.3 million, primarily due to lower research and development expenses
on automotive fuel cell programs as a result of the automotive transaction.

Net income increased to $34.1 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to a net loss of $57.3 million,
or ($0.50) per share, in 2007. Net income for 2008 included a gain on sale of assets of $96.8
million resulting from the automotive transaction, partially offset by the write-down of a non-core
investment of $3.0 million.


Normalized net loss1 increased to $60.0 million, or ($0.71) per share, representing a
$7.7 million increase compared with $52.2 million or ($0.46) per share in 2007. This increase in
normalized net loss is primarily a result of non-operating items, including decreases in foreign
exchange gains of $12.4 million and decreases in investment income of $6.2 million. Decreases in
product and service gross margins and engineering development revenues were more than offset by
decreases in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization.


Operating cash consumption1 for 2008 decreased 23% to $29.3 million, compared to $38.2
million for 2007, meeting our guidance range of $20 million to $30 million. This $8.9 million
improvement was driven primarily by lower working capital requirements, lower operating expenses
and lower capital expenditures partially offset by lower foreign exchange gains of $12.4 million, a
decline in investment income of $6.2 million and lower product and service gross margins and
engineering development revenues.

This release contains forward-looking statements, including estimated future revenue and operating
cash consumption contained in our outlook, which are provided to enable external stakeholders to
understand our expectations as at the date of this release and may not be appropriate for other
purposes. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Ballard’s
management and reflect Ballard’s current expectations as contemplated under section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Such assumptions relate to Ballard’s financial forecasts and expectations regarding its
product development efforts, manufacturing capacity, and market demand, and include matters such as
generating new sales, producing, delivering and selling the expected number of units, and
controlling its costs.

 

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause Ballard’s actual results to be
materially different, including, without limitation, the rate of mass adoption of its products,
product development delays, changing environmental regulations, its ability to attract and retain
business partners and customers, its access to funding, increased competition, its ability to
protect its intellectual property, changes in its customers’ requirements, foreign exchange impacts
on its net monetary assets and its ability to provide the capital required for product development,
operations and marketing. For a detailed discussion of these risk factors and other risk factors
that could affect Ballard’s future performance, please refer to Ballard’s most recent Annual
Information Form.

 

Readers should not place undue reliance on Ballard’s forward-looking statements and Ballard assumes
no obligation to update or release any revisions to these forward looking statements, other than as
required under applicable legislation.


Endnote:

1 Operating cash consumption and normalized net loss are non-GAAP measures used to
assist in assessing Ballard’s financial performance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar
measures presented by other companies. Operating cash consumption measures the amount of cash
required to fund the operating activities of Ballard’s business and excludes financing and
investing activities except for net additions to property, plant and equipment. Normalized net loss
measures our net loss after excluding items that are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal
continued operating activity of the business. Gains on sale of assets held for sale, losses from
discontinued operations and write-downs of long-lived assets are not considered part of our core
activities, and are expected to occur infrequently. Therefore we have removed these in our
calculation of normalized net loss.
