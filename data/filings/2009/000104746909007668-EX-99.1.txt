  QUARTERLY MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS      UNITED STATES GAAP      (all figures are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise noted and  all units of measurement expressed in metric unless
otherwise noted)        


 Results of Operations  

        Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited ("Agnico-Eagle" or the "Company") reported second quarter net income of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per
share, compared to net income of $8.3 million, or $0.06 per share, in the second quarter of 2008. These net income results of the second quarter of 2009 include a non-cash foreign
currency translation loss of $16.7 million, or $0.12 per share, as well as a stock option expense of $5.0 million, or $0.03 per share. Excluding these non-cash items, net
income increased significantly when compared to the second quarter of 2008 due to a large increase in gold revenue. Gold production in the second quarter of 2009 increased to 119,053 ounces
from 67,757 ounces in the second quarter of 2008 due to the commencement of commercial production at the Kittila and Lapa Mines, combined with full production of the Goldex Mine during the
second quarter of 2009. Cash provided from operating activities was $26.4 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $92.8 million in the prior year's second quarter. The
impact of significantly higher gold production, compared to the second quarter of 2008, was more than offset by changes in working capital related to a build-up of gold in inventory from
the start up of new mines. 

        The
table below summarizes the key variances in net income for the second quarter of 2009 from the net income reported for the same period in 2008.

        On
May 1, 2009, both the Kittila Mine and Lapa Mine achieved commercial production. As a result, commencing on May 1, 2009, all revenues generated and their related costs
of production at the Kittila Mine and Lapa Mine were recognized on the income statement versus being capitalized to property, plant and mine development prior to commercial production. 

        In
the second quarter of 2009, revenues from mining operations increased to $133.1 million from $85.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. This is mainly due to the
increase in gold production by the Goldex, Kittila and Lapa mines that were not in commercial production in the second quarter of 2008. These three new mines sold an incremental 43,448 ounces
during the second quarter of 2009 when compared to the second quarter of 2008. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, there were higher realized gold prices partially offset by lower realized
silver and copper prices when compared to the second quarter of 2008. 

        In
the second quarter of 2009, total cash costs per ounce increased to $326 per ounce of gold produced from $113 per ounce in the second quarter of 2008. The main drivers leading to the
increase in total cash costs for the quarter were lower byproduct revenue due to lower realized sales prices on copper and silver
combined with the fact that the three new mines are producing only gold with no credits against production costs from byproduct revenue.

Notes: 


(i)Under
the Company's revenue recognition policy, revenue is recognized on concentrates when legal title passes. Since total cash costs are calculated on a
production basis, this inventory adjustment reflects the sales margin on the portion of concentrate production for which revenue has not been recognized in the period.
(ii)Total
cash costs is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. The Company
believes that this generally accepted industry measure is a realistic indication of operating performance and is useful in allowing year over year comparisons. As illustrated in the table above, this
measure is calculated by adjusting Production Costs as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for net byproduct revenues, inventory adjustments and asset retirement
provisions. This measure is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management uses this measure to monitor the
performance of the Company's mining operations. Since market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using this per ounce measure allows management to assess the mine's cash generating
capabilities at various gold prices. Management is aware that this per ounce measure of performance can be impacted by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and exchange rates. Management compensates
for the limitation inherent with this measure by using it in conjunction with the minesite costs per tonne measure (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating metal prices and exchange rates.
(iii)This
inventory adjustment reflects production costs associated with unsold concentrates.
(iv)Minesite
costs per tonne is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. As
illustrated in the table above, this measure is calculated by adjusting Production Costs as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for inventory and hedging
adjustments (if any) and asset retirement provisions and then dividing by tonnes processed through the mill. Since total cash costs data can be affected by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and
exchange rates, management believes minesite costs per tonne provides additional information regarding the performance of mining operations and allows management to monitor operating costs on a more
consistent basis as the per tonne measure eliminates the cost variability associated with varying production levels. Management also uses this measure to determine the economic viability of mining
blocks. As each mining block is evaluated based on the net realizable value of each tonne mined, in order to be economically viable the estimated revenue on a per tonne basis must be in excess of the
minesite costs per tonne. Management is aware that this per tonne measure is impacted by fluctuations in production levels and thus uses this evaluation tool in conjunction with production costs
prepared in accordance with US GAAP. This measure supplements production cost information prepared in accordance with US GAAP and allows investors to distinguish between changes in production costs
resulting from changes in production versus changes in operating performance. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

        At June 30, 2009, Agnico-Eagle's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totalled
$173.9 million, while working capital was $339.6 million. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $99.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments
and restricted cash and $178.2 million in working capital. The Company's policy is to invest excess cash in highly liquid investments of the highest credit quality to eliminate any risks
associated with these investments. Such investments with remaining maturities at time of purchase greater than three months are classified as short-term investments and decisions regarding
the length of maturities are based on cash flow requirements, rates of returns and various other factors. 

        Cash
provided by operating activities was $26.4 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $92.8 million in the second quarter of 2008. In the second quarter of
2009, revenues from mining operations increased to $133.1 million from $85.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. This was mainly due to the increase 

4




 

in
gold production by the Goldex, Kittila and Lapa mines that were not in commercial production in the second quarter of 2008. These three new mines sold 43,448 commercial production ounces
during the second quarter of 2009 as compared to nil ounces in the second quarter of 2008. However, the impact of significantly higher gold production, compared to the second quarter of 2008, was more
than offset by changes in working capital related to a build-up of gold in inventory from the start up of new mines. Excluding the large changes in working capital movements, cash provided
by operating activities increased significantly when compared to the second quarter of 2008 due to the large growth in gold revenue. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, there were higher
realized gold prices partially offset by lower realized silver and copper prices when compared to the second quarter of 2008. 


        For
the three months ended June 30, 2009, capital expenditures were $155.0 million compared to $263.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2008. The
significant capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2009 pertained to the Meadowbank and Pinos Altos projects. The capital expenditures were significantly lower during the second
quarter of 2009 when compared to the second quarter of 2008 due to the completion of construction activities at the Goldex, Kittila and Lapa mines and the winding down of construction at the Pinos
Altos mine. 

        During
the second quarter of 2009, Agnico-Eagle executed a new non-amortizing $600 million revolving credit facility, maturing June 2012. The new facility
replaces a pre-existing $300 million tranche of the Company's credit lines that would have matured September 2010. The new facility together with the remaining tranche of the
pre-existing credit facilities (non-amortizing $300 million revolving credit line, maturing January 2013), allow for borrowings of up to $900 million. Both
credit facilities are unsecured. During the second quarter of 2009, Agnico-Eagle also executed an unsecured C$95 million bonding facility with Export Development Canada. This facility matures
June 2014 and will be used to provide letters of credit for environmental obligations or in relation to license or permit bonds relating to the Meadowbank project. 

        During
the second quarter of 2009, the Company drew down an additional $70 million from its bank debt facilities. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had $415 million
in undrawn credit lines. The amount available under the facility is reduced by letters of credit drawn under the facility. Letters of Credit outstanding under the facility at June 30, 2009
amounted to $20 million, and therefore, the amount available to be borrowed as of June 30, 2009, was approximately $395 million. The facility requires the Company to maintain
specified financial ratios and meet financial condition covenants. These financial condition covenants were met at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008. 

        Also
during the second quarter of 2009, $18.5 million of common shares were issued which was attributable to the issuance of flow through shares and the exercising of
stock options.

remains high in global financial markets and weakness in the global economy continues to have a serious impact on the profitability and liquidity of many businesses. Although
there are signs of stabilization, the timing of a return to historical market conditions is uncertain. Virtually all industries, including the gold mining business, have been affected by weak economic
conditions and volatile financial markets. Positive signs for the global economy include a relative easing of credit risk spreads, a reduction in financial systemic risk, lower levels of volatility in
many markets and an improvement in investor confidence. However, economic data show mixed signals for the likelihood of sustained near-term economic recovery, and the costs of funding for
many businesses, especially for financial institutions with which we do business, remain high compared to historical levels. A prolonged global recession and continuation of volatility in world
markets could have a significant impact on our business. In particular, the global credit/liquidity crisis could continue to affect the cost and availability of financing and our overall liquidity.
The volatility in gold, silver, zinc and copper prices affects the amount of our revenues, and our earnings and cash flow. Volatile energy prices, commodity and consumables prices and currency
exchange rates impact our production costs. The volatility of global stock markets impacts the valuation of our equity investments.

    AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            (thousands of United States dollars except share and per share amounts, unless
otherwise indicated)  (Unaudited)  June 30, 2009        


 1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION  



The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") in US dollars. They do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. Accordingly, these unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2008 annual consolidated financial statements, including the accounting policies and notes thereto, included in the Annual Report and Annual
Information Form/Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2008. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as at June 30, 2009 and the results of operations and cash flows for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. 

Operating
results for the three and six months period ended June 30, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending
December 31, 2009. 



 2.     USE OF ESTIMATES  



The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ
from these estimates. 



 3.     ACCOUNTING POLICIES  



These
interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the December 31, 2008 audited annual consolidated financial statements
except for the changes discussed below. 

 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

In
March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" ("FAS 161") which provides revised
guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under the FASB Statement
No. 133, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for the Company's
fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. To the extent the required information was not previously disclosed in the 2008 annual consolidated financial statements, new disclosures have been
incorporated in note 10. 

In
April 2009, the FASB issued Statement No. 107-1, "Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" to enhance the transparency surrounding the
treatment of financial instruments. This new guidance requires FAS 107 disclosures to be made at each interim reporting period regardless of how these instruments are recognized in the
financial statements. The Company adopted the increased disclosure requirements beginning in the interim period ended June 30, 2009. Refer to note 10 for related disclosures. 

In
May 2009, the FASB issued Statement No. 165, "Subsequent Events" to provide authoritative accounting literature that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of
events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements beginning in the interim period
ended June 30, 2009. Refer to note 13 for related disclosures.

 4.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  



The
FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157") defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP, and requires expanded disclosures
about fair value measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are: 



Level 1 — Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 


Level 2 — Quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability; 

Level 3 — Prices
or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by
little or no market activity). 



The
following table sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value within the fair value hierarchy.

(1)Fair
value approximates the carrying amounts due to the short-term nature.
(2)Recorded
at fair value using quoted market prices.
(3)Recorded
at cost. This line item also includes accrued interest.
(4)Recorded
at fair value based on broker-dealer quotations. 


Both
the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are held to maturity and valued using interest
rates observable at commonly quoted intervals. Cash equivalents are market securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. 



 5.     CAPITAL STOCK  



During
the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company implemented a restricted share unit ("RSU") plan for certain employees. A deferred compensation balance was recorded for the total
grant-date value on the date of the grant. The deferred compensation balance was recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity and is being amortized as compensation expense
(or capitalized to construction in progress) over the applicable vesting period. 

The
Company funded the plan by transferring $3.0 million to an employee benefit trust ("the Trust") that then purchased shares of the Company in the open market. For accounting purposes,
the Trust is treated as a variable interest entity and consolidated in the accounts of the Company. On consolidation, the dividends paid on the shares held by the Trust were eliminated. The shares
purchased and held by the Trust are treated as not being outstanding for the basic earnings per share ("EPS") calculations. They are amortized back into basic EPS over the vesting period. All of the
shares held by the Trust were included in the diluted EPS calculations. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company's warrants were dilutive and were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. There were no outstanding warrants in the
second quarter of 2008.

 5.     CAPITAL STOCK (Continued)

following table presents the maximum number of common shares that would be outstanding if all instruments outstanding at June 30, 2009 were exercised:

During
the six months ended June 30, 2009, 2,271,000 (2008 — 2,520,000) options were granted with an exercise price of C$62.63
(2008 — C$55.06), 718,000 (2008 — 1,248,459) employee stock options were exercised for cash of $18.9 million
(2008 — $30.5 million), and 70,000 (2008 — 55,400) options were cancelled with a weighted average exercise price of
C$56.50 (2008 — C$49.42). 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2009, 30,000 (2008 — 115,000) options were granted with an exercise price of C$52.37
(2008 — C$66.43), 115,700 (2008 — 26,790) employee stock options were exercised for cash of $3.9 million
(2008 — $1.1 million), and nil (2008 — 100) options were cancelled with a weighted average exercise price of nil
(2008 — C$8.25). 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company closed a private placement from treasury for a total of 175,000 flow-through shares for total proceeds of
$12.9 million (2008 — nil). The Company has an obligation
to incur $12.9 million in qualified exploration expenditures and to renounce such expenditures to the investors of these flow-through shares. 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company closed two private placements from treasury for a total of 358,900 flow-through shares for total proceeds of
$25.9 million (2008 — nil). The Company has an obligation to incur $25.9 million in qualified exploration expenditures and to renounce such
expenditures to the investors of these flow-through shares. 

The
difference between the flow-through share issuance price and the market price of Agnico-Eagle's shares at the time of purchase is recorded as a liability at the time the
flow-through shares are issued. This liability terminates when the exploration expenditures are renounced to investors. The difference between the flow-through share issuance
price and market price reduces the future tax expense charged to income as this difference represents proceeds received by the Company for the sale of future tax deductions to investors in the
flow-through shares.

following table illustrates the changes in capital stock for the six months ended June 30, 2009:

 8.     LONG-TERM DEBT  



During
the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company executed a new non-amortizing $600 million revolving credit facility, maturing June 2012. The new facility
replaces a pre-existing $300 million tranche of the Company's credit lines that would have matured September 2010. The new facility together with the remaining tranche of the
pre-existing credit facilities (non-amortizing $300 million revolving credit line, maturing January 2013), allow for borrowings of up to $900 million. Both
credit facilities are unsecured. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2009, Agnico-Eagle executed an unsecured C$95 million bonding facility with Export Development
Canada. This facility matures June 2014 and will be used to provide letters of credit for environmental obligations or in relation to license or permit bonds relating to the Meadowbank project.

During
the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company drew down an additional $70.0 million from the credit facilities and incurred $1.7 million of interest that was
capitalized to property, plant and mine development (2008 — nil). At June 30, 2009, the credit facilities were drawn down by a total of
$485.0 million (2008 — $75.0 million). 



 9.     INCOME TAXES  



On
December 12, 2008, the Company executed a Canadian federal tax election to start using the US dollar as its functional currency for federal Canadian income tax purposes. As the related tax
legislation was enacted in the first quarter of 2009, this election applies to taxation years ended December 31, 2008 and subsequent. It was determined upon filing the 2008 income tax return
that this election resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $21.0 million for the period ended June 30, 2009. 

The
tax effect of other comprehensive income (loss) for the period is comprised of the following amounts:

 10.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  



From
time to time, the Company has entered into financial instruments with a number of financial institutions in order to hedge underlying cash flow and fair value exposures arising from changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices or foreign currency exchange rates. 

In
2008 and 2009, financial instruments which have subjected the Company to market risk and concentration of credit risk consisted primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in high quality securities issued by government agencies, financial institutions and major
corporations and limits the amount of credit exposure by diversifying its holdings. 

The
Company generates almost all of its revenues in US dollars. The Company's Canadian operations, which include the LaRonde Mine, the Goldex Mine and the Lapa and Meadowbank mine projects, have
Canadian dollar requirements for capital, operating and exploration expenditures. 

In
the third quarter of 2008, to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates, the Company entered into three zero cost collars to hedge the functional currency equivalent
cash flows associated with the Canadian dollar denominated capital expenditures. In March 2009, the Company entered into another zero cost collar for the same purpose. The purchase of US dollar
put options has been financed through selling US dollar call options at a higher level such that the net premium payable to the different counterparties by the Company is nil. The hedged items
represent monthly forecasted Canadian dollar cash outflows during 2009. At June 30, 2009, the zero cost collars hedge $115.0 million of 2009 expenditures
(2008 — nil). The cash flow hedging relationship meets all requirements per FAS 133 to be effective, and unrealized gains and losses are recognized within
other comprehensive income ("OCI"). 

Gains
and losses deferred in accumulated OCI are reclassified into income when amortization (or depreciation) of the hedged capital asset begins. In other words, gains and losses in accumulated
OCI are reclassified into income in the same period or periods the asset affects income. Amounts transferred out of accumulated OCI are recorded in depreciation expense. The total amount of unrealized
gain on the hedges was $1.8 million as at June 30, 2009. No amounts were reclassified into income during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and none are expected to be
reclassified into income in 2009. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company reclassified a realized gain of $1.3 million
(2008 — nil) and a realized loss of $1.4 million (2008 — nil) respectively from accumulated OCI to Meadowbank project
development costs. 

The
following table shows the changes in the accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") balances recorded in the consolidated financial statements pertaining to the foreign exchange hedging
activities. The fair values, based on Black-Scholes

As
at December 31, 2008, the Company had two unmatured covered call options on available-for-sale securities with a premium including a
mark-to-market valuation, amounting to $3.9 million. Premiums received on the sale of covered call options are recorded as a liability until they mature or the position
is closed. The Company sold these call options against the shares of Goldcorp Inc. ("Goldcorp") to reduce its price exposure to the Goldcorp shares it acquired in connection with Goldcorp's
acquisition of Gold Eagle. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company closed the two covered call option positions at a cost of $0.4 million and recognized a net gain of
$3.6 million in the interest and sundry income component of the consolidated statements of income (2008 — nil). 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company entered into three covered call options against the shares of Goldcorp that were closed in the second quarter of 2009, resulting in a
net gain of $4.1 million in the interest and sundry income component of the consolidated statements of income (2008 — nil). 

The
total net gain related to the written call options against the shares of Goldcorp recognized in the interest and sundry income component of the consolidated statements of income for the six months
ended June 30, 2009 was $7.7 million (2008 — nil). 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company entered into four additional covered call options against the shares of Goldcorp that were unmatured at period end with a premium,
including a Black-Scholes calculated mark-to-market valuation, amounting to $2.2 million (2008 — nil). The fair value of the
covered call options approximate their carrying value as at June 30, 2009. This amount, currently recorded as a liability, is expected to be recognized through the consolidated
statements of income in the third quarter of 2009. 


There
were no metal derivative positions in the second quarter of 2009 and none throughout 2008. 

The
fair values of the Company's current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying values as at June 30, 2009. 



 11.   COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND GUARANTEES  



As
part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company has been required to provide assurance in the form of letters of credit for environmental and site restoration costs, custom credits,
government grants and other general corporate purposes. As at June 30, 2009, the total amount of these guarantees was $64.0 million. 

Certain
of the Company's properties are subject to royalty arrangements. The following are the most significant royalties: 

The
Company has a royalty agreement with the Finnish government relating to the Kittila Mine. Starting 12 months after the mining operations commence, the Company has to pay 2% on net smelter
return, defined as revenue less processing costs. The royalty is paid on a yearly basis the following year. 

The
Company is committed to pay a royalty on future production from the Meadowbank mine project. The Nunavut Tunngavik administered mineral claims are subject to production leases including a 12% net
profits interest royalty from which annual deductions are limited to 85% of gross revenue. Production from Crown mining leases is subject to a royalty of up to 14% of adjusted net profits, as defined
in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations under the Territorial Lands Act (Canada). 

The
Company is committed to pay a royalty on production from properties in the Abitibi area. The type of royalty agreements include but are not limited to net profits interest royalty and net smelter
return royalty with percentages ranging from 0.5% to 5%.
