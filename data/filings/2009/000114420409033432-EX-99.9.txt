    SECTION
4.02.  Specific
Performance.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage

Agreement remain as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.
    
    SECTION
4.06.  Governing
Law.  All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdictions other than the State of New York.  The parties hereby
agree that all actions or proceedings arising directly or indirectly from or in
connection with this Agreement shall be litigated only in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York located in New York County, New York.  The
parties consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the foregoing courts and

signature pages to this Agreement (and service so made shall be deemed complete
three (3) days after the same has been posted as aforesaid) or by personal
service or in such other manner as may be permissible under the rules of said
courts.  Each of the Company and each Stockholder irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action, or
proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that suit, action, or
proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE
ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
