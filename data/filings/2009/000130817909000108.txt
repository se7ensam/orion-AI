<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>This discussion of our Operational and Financial Review and Prospects contains forward-looking statements based on beliefs of our management. We use the words &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause the actual results to be materially different, including, among others, changes in general economic and business conditions, changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, introduction of competing products, lack of acceptance of new products or services and changes in business strategy. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the forecasts and targets included in this discussion under the heading &#147;Oper
ating and Financial Review and Prospects as of and for the Period Ended June 30, 2009 &#151; Overall Perspective,&#148; with respect to (i) our expectation that the global telecommunications equipment and related services market will decline between 8% and 12% at constant currencies in 2009, (ii) our expectation that we will reduce costs and expenses, excluding the negative non-cash impacts of Lucent&#8217;s purchase price allocation, by &#8364; 750 million on an exit run rate by the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, and (iii) our expectation that we will achieve income from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendment (excluding the negative, non-cash impacts of Lucent&#146;s purchase price allocation) around break-even in full year 2009, (iv) our estimate that the actions we are taking to offset a potential unfavorable shift in our product and geographic mi
x should generate annual savings of &#8364;250 million (as part of the reduction of costs and expenses of &#8364; 750 million mentioned above) and our view that the increase of the U.S. dollar versus the euro in the first half of 2009 had a negative impact on our gross profit as a percentage of revenue, included in this discussion under the heading &#147;Consolidated Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 &#150; Gross Profit&#148;, and (v) the amount we would be required to pay in the future pursuant to our existing contractual obligations and off-balance sheet contingent commitments, included in this discussion under the heading &#147;Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet contingent commitments&#148;.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 presented elsewhere in this document (the &#147;unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements&#148;) and the related notes. Our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;) as adopted by the European Union. IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, differ in certain respects from the International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. However, our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with IFRS would be no different if we had applied International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Internatio
nal Accounting Standards Board. References to &#147;IFRS&#148; in this Form 6-K refer to IFRS as adopted by the European Union.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>On November 30, 2006, historical Alcatel and Lucent Technologies Inc. (&quot;Lucent&quot;) completed a business combination pursuant to which Lucent became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcatel. As a result of the purchase accounting treatment of the Lucent business combination required by IFRS, our results for 2007, 2008 and the first half of 2009 included several negative, non-cash impacts of purchase accounting entries.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The recoverable values of our goodwill and intangible assets, as determined for the 2009 annual impairment test performed by the Group in the second quarter 2009, are based on key assumptions which could have a significant impact on the interim consolidated financial statements. These key assumptions include among others the following elements:</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; padding-left:42.55pt; text-indent:-7.1pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>- discount rate; and</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; padding-left:42.55pt; text-indent:-7.1pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>- projected cash-flows arising out of the successful implementation of the strategic plan the Group publicly announced on December 12, 2008 and on a nominal rate of growth of our revenues in 2010.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The discount rate used for the annual impairment tests of 2009 and 2008 was the Group&#146;s weighted average cost of capital (&#147;WACC&#148;) of 11% and 10% respectively. For the additional impairment test performed during the fourth quarter 2008, the rate used was 12%. These discount rates are after-tax rates applied to after-tax cash flows. The use of such rates results in recoverable values that are identical to those that would be obtained by using, as required by IAS 36, pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows. Given the absence of comparable &#147;pure player&#148; listed companies for each group of Cash Generating Units, we do not believe that the assessment of a specific WACC for each product or market is feasible. A single discount rate has therefore been used on the basis that risks specific to certain products or markets have been reflected in determining the cash flows. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2009 recoverable values of goodwill and intangible assets by &#8364; 373 million and &#8364; 406 million, respectively. An increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would not have impacted impairment losses as of June 30, 2009.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As indicated in note 1g, in addition to the annual goodwill impairment tests, impairment tests are carried out if Alcatel-Lucent has indications of a potential reduction in the value of its goodwill or intangible assets. Possible impairments are based on discounted future cash flows and/or fair values of the assets concerned. Changes in the market conditions or the cash flows initially estimated can therefore lead to a review and a change in the impairment losses previously recorded.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Pension and post-retirement costs had a &#8364; 72 million net negative effect on &#8220;income (loss) before tax and discontinued operations&#8221; during the first six months of 2009 (&#8364;&nbsp;131 million increase in pre-tax income during the first six months of 2008). </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The weighted average expected rates of return on pension and post-retirement plan assets used to determine Alcatel-Lucent pension and post-retirement credits are established at the beginning of each fiscal year. The decrease in the weighted average expected rates of return on pension and post-retirement plan assets between 2008 and 2009 is mainly due to adjustments in expected future returns based on studies performed by Alcatel-Lucent external investment advisors. Even if the actual financial markets are very volatile, this assumption is required to be a long-term expected rate of return rather than a prediction of the immediate next period performance and is not reviewed every quarter. In addition, these rates that are used to determine the pension expense or income are applied on the opening fair value. For Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s U.S. plans, the pension expense or income is updated every quarter. Therefore, the 2009 second quarter expected return on pl
an assets (accounted for in financial income) for Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s U.S. plans is based on March 31, 2009 plan asset fair values, whereas the expected return on plan assets for non U.S. Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s plans is based on the fair values of plan assets at December 31, 2008. The interest cost associated with the plan liabilities is also impacted by the change in discount rates used to value the plan liabilities. The Group recognized a US$&nbsp;71 million decrease between the first and the second quarters of 2009 in the net pension credit, which is accounted for in &#147;other financial income (loss)&#148; (expected return on plan assets for Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s U.S. plans due to the decline of the plan asset fair values and expected change of the interest cost in relation with the decrease of the liability). On U.S. plans, the Group expects a US$ 65 million increase of the net pension credit to be accounted for in financial result between the 2009 second quarter and the 2009 third quarter.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>At its meeting in July 2009, as part of the prudent management of&nbsp;our group's funding of&nbsp;our U.S.&nbsp;pension and retirement obligations,&nbsp;our Board of Directors approved the following modifications to the asset allocation of&nbsp;our group's funds:&nbsp;&nbsp;the portion of funds invested in equity&nbsp;securities is to be reduced from&nbsp;22.5% to 15% and the portion invested in bonds is to be increased from 62.5% to 70%, while the portion in alternatives (i.e., real estate, private equity and hedge funds) is to remain unchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in equity investments to increased fixed income was achieved immediately.&nbsp; The changes within the fixed income portfolio could take up to a year to complete. We believe that these changes should lead to a slight increase in long term returns from financial assets.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Plans assets are invested in many different asset categories (such as cash, equities, bonds, real estate, private equity, etc&#133;). In the quarterly update of plan asset fair values, approximately 80% are based on closing date fair values and 20% have a one to three month delay as the fair value of private equity, venture capital, real estate and absolute return investments are not available in a short period. This is standard practice in the investment management industry. Assuming that the June 30, 2009 actual fair value of private equity, venture capital, real estate and absolute return on investments was 10% lower than the ones used for accounting purposes as of June 30, 2009, since the Management Pension Plan has a material investment in these assets classes (and the asset ceiling is not applicable to these plans), equity will be negatively impacted by approximately &#8364;&nbsp;210 million.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>For the purposes of calculating any net pension and post-retirement credit, the discount rates are determined at the beginning of each quarterly period (for significant plans). For the purposes of determining the plan obligations, these rates are determined at the end of each period. Alcatel-Lucent is using a discount rate of 6.44% during fiscal 2009 to determine plan obligations. The change in the discount rate from 2008 was due to increasing long-term interest rates. Discount rates also are somewhat volatile because they are set based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date. The discount rate used to determine the post-retirement benefit costs is slightly lower due to a shorter expected duration of post-retirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and the Alcatel-Lucent net pension and post-retirement credit and profitability, whereas a higher discount rate reduce
s the plan obligations and the Alcatel-Lucent net pension and post-retirement credit and profitability.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The expected rate of return on pension and post-retirement plan assets and the discount rate were determined in accordance with consistent methodologies.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2008 net pension and post-retirement result by approximately &#8364;&nbsp;28&nbsp;million and &#8364;&nbsp;34&nbsp;million, respectively. A 0.5% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the 2008 net pension and post-retirement result by approximately &#8364;&nbsp;133 million. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The Group&#8217;s U.S. companies have taken various actions to reduce their share of retiree health care costs, including the shifting or increases of certain costs to their retirees. Health care benefits for employees who retired from Lucent&#146;s predecessor prior to March 1, 1990 are not subject to annual dollar caps on Lucent&#146;s share of future benefit costs. The benefit obligation associated with this retiree group approximated 59% of the total U.S. retiree health care obligation as of December 31, 2008. Management employees who retired on or after March 1, 1990 have paid amounts above the applicable annual dollar caps on Lucent's share of future benefit costs since 2001.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Beginning in 2009, the Group participated in a Medicare Private Fee For Service (PFFS) plan for Medicare eligible management retirees in the US. &nbsp;Initially, the Group&#146;s Medicare payments to the PFFS plan is somewhat higher than its Medicare payments to individuals. The Group expects the additional Medicare payments to the PFFS plan to decline by 90% over a 10-year period. However, the decrease for 2010 will be larger than anticipated. The Group expects to reflect this effect during the 2009 third quarter when it finalizes its negotiations with the PFFS plan provider.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent&#146;s collective bargaining agreements were ratified during December&nbsp;2004 and address retiree health care benefits, among other items. Lucent agreed to continue to subsidize these benefits up to the established cap level consistent with current actuarial assumptions. Except for costs attributable to an implementation period that ended on February 1, 2005, costs that are in excess of this capped level are being borne by the retirees in the form of premiums and plan design changes. Lucent also agreed to establish a US$&nbsp;400 million trust that is being funded by Lucent over eight years and managed jointly by trustees appointed by Lucent and the unions. This trust is currently being funded by Section 420 transfers from the over funded Occupational Pension Plan. The trust is being used to mitigate the cost impact on retirees of premiums or plan design changes. The agreements also acknowledge that retiree health care benefits will no longer be
 a required subject of bargaining between Lucent and the unions.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The amount of prepaid pension costs that can be recognized in our financial statements is limited to the sum of (i) the cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses and past service cost, (ii) the present value of any available refunds from the plan, and (iii) any reduction in future contributions to the plan. As Lucent currently intends to use eligible excess pension assets applicable to formerly represented retirees to fund certain retiree healthcare benefits for such retirees, such use has been considered as a reimbursement from the pension plan. The funded status of the formerly represented retiree health care obligation of &#8364;&nbsp;1,607 million as of June 30, 2009 (&#8364;&nbsp;1,479 million as of December 31, 2008), the present value of Medicare Part D subsidies of approximately &#8364;&nbsp;262 million as of June 30, 2009 (as this amount is currently netted in the retiree health care obligation - &#8364;&nbsp;272 million as of December 31, 20
08) and the present value of future service costs of &#8364;&nbsp;46 million as of June 30, 2009 (&#8364;&nbsp;61 million as of December 31, 2008) have been considered in determining the asset ceiling limitation for Lucent's pension plans as of June 30, 2009.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The impact of expected future economic benefits on the pension plan asset ceiling is a complex matter. Based on latest estimates, as of the January 1, 2009 valuation date, there were approximately &#8364;&nbsp;1.8 billion of pension plan assets that would be eligible for &quot;collectively bargained&quot; transfers to fund retiree health care costs for Lucent&#8217;s formerly represented retirees (alternatively, &#8364;&nbsp;2.1 billion would be available for &#8220;multi-year&#8221; transfers, which also require the plan to remain 120% funded during the transfer period). This amount is sufficient to address the obligation arising from the healthcare being provided to Lucent&#146;s formerly represented retirees and as a result the Group should be able to utilize pension plan assets for Section 420 &#147;collectively bargained&#148; or &#147;multi-year&#148; transfers to fund all its health care obligations for Lucent&#146;s formerly represented retirees.
 Changes in plan asset values, funding levels or new legislation could result in significant changes in the asset ceiling that will impact our equity and could impact the ultimate amount of plan assets eligible for Section 420 transfers.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In December 2008, the Group made a Section 420 transfer of US$&nbsp;653 million to cover the health care costs for Lucent's formerly represented retirees for 2008 and nine months of 2009. This had an US$&nbsp;270&nbsp;million positive impact in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2008.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The impact of the different actuarial assumptions on the level of the funded status could have consequences on the funding requirements and the determination of the asset ceiling, which would affect our ability to make Section 420 transfers in the future and use the overfunding of some pension plans to fund underfunded healthcare plans related to the same beneficiaries.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As indicated in note 1o to our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements, revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of a product to the buyer.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>For revenues and expenses generated from construction contracts, the Group applies the percentage of completion method of accounting, provided certain specified conditions are met, based either on the achievement of contractually defined milestones or on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The determination of the stage of completion and the revenues to be recognized rely on numerous estimations based on costs incurred and acquired experience. Adjustments of initial estimates can, however, occur throughout the life of the contract, which can have significant impacts on future net income (loss).</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Although estimates inherent in construction contracts are subject to uncertainty, certain situations exist whereby management is unable to reliably estimate the outcome of a construction contract. These situations can occur during the early stages of a contract due to a lack of historical experience or throughout the contract as significant uncertainties develop related to additional costs, claims and performance obligations, particularly with new technologies. During the fourth quarter of 2007, as a result of cost overruns and major technical problems that we experienced in implementing a large W-CDMA contract, we determined that we could no longer estimate with sufficient reliability the final revenue and associated costs of such contract. As a result, we expensed all the contract costs incurred to that date, but we only recognized revenues to the extent that the contract costs incurred were recoverable. Consequently, revenues of &#8364;&nbsp;72 millio
n and cost of sales of &#8364;&nbsp;298 million were recognized in 2007 in connection with this construction contract. The negative impact on income (loss) before income tax and discontinued operations of changing from the percentage of completion method to this basis of accounting was &#8364;&nbsp;98 million for 2007. No change in the accounting treatment occurred in 2008 and during the first six months of 2009. If and when reliable estimates become available, revenue and costs associated with the construction contract will then be recognized respectively by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the statement of financial position date. Future results of operations may therefore be impacted.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>For arrangements to sell software licenses with services, software license revenue is recognized separately from the related service revenue, provided the transaction adheres to certain criteria (as prescribed by the Statement of Position SOP 97-2 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or the AICPA), such as the existence of sufficient vendor-specific objective evidence (&quot;VSOE&quot;) to determine the fair value of the various elements of the arrangement.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Some of the Group's products include software that is embedded in the hardware at delivery. In those cases, where indications are that software is more than incidental, such as where the transaction includes software upgrades or enhancements, more prescriptive software revenue recognition rules are applied to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. As products with embedded software are continually evolving, as well as the features and functionality of the product driven by software components that are becoming more critical to their operation and success in the market, the Group is continually assessing the applicability of some of the guidance of SOP 97-2 including whether software is more than incidental. Several factors are considered in making this determination including (i) whether the software is a significant focus of the marketing effort or is sold separately, (ii) whether updates, upgrades and other support services are provide
d on the software component and (iii) whether the cost to develop the software component of the product is significant in relation to the costs to develop the product as a whole. The determination of whether the evolution of our products and marketing efforts should result in the application of some of SOP 97-2 guidance requires the use of significant professional judgment. Further, the Group believes that reasonable people evaluating similar facts and circumstances may come to different conclusions regarding the most appropriate accounting model to apply in this environment. Our future results of operations may be significantly impacted, particularly due to the timing of revenue recognition, if we change our assessment as to whether software is incidental, particularly if VSOE or similar fair value cannot be obtained with respect to one or more of the undelivered elements.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>For product sales made through distributors, product returns that are estimated according to contractual obligations and past sales statistics are recognized as a reduction of sales.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>It can be difficult to evaluate the Group&#146;s capacity to recover receivables.

The cost of the physical damage and business interruption are insured and will give right to an indemnity claim, the amount of which is currently being assessed by our insurers. Indemnity payment will be accounted for as other revenue once virtually certain and reliable estimates are available, which could take up to one to two years to determine.

Any adjustment of the carrying amount of an identifiable asset or liability made as a result of completing the initial accounting is accounted for as if its fair value at the acquisition date had been recognized from that date.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Some of our convertible bonds have optional redemption periods/dates before their contractual maturity as described in note 15 to our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements. All the convertible bonds issues by Alcatel-Lucent were accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 requirements (paragraphs 28 to 32) as described above in note 1-m. Classification of the liability and equity component of a convertible instrument is not revised as a result of a change in the likelihood that a conversion will be exercised. On the other hand, in case of optional redemption periods/dates occurring before the contractual maturity of the debenture, the likelihood of a redemption before the contractual maturity could lead to a change in the estimated payments. As prescribed by IAS 39, if an issuer revises the estimates of payment, due to reliable new estimates, it must adjust the carrying amount of the instrument by computing the present value of remain
ing cash flows at the original effective interest rate of the financial liability to reflect the revised estimated cash flows. The adjustment is recognized as income or expense in profit or loss.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As described in notes 6, 15 and 17 to our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements, such a change in estimates occurred during the second quarter of 2009 regarding Lucent&#146;s 2.875% Series A convertible debenture.

The potential impact from a change in the Group&#146;s estimate of redemption triggers on all of Lucent&#146; convertible debt on &#147;other financial income (loss)&#148; will be a loss corresponding to the difference between the present value of the revised estimated cash flows and the carrying amount derived from the split accounting as described in note 1-m.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><B><I><BR></I></B></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Overview of the first half of 2009. </I>The global recession has been a critical force affecting the market for telecommunications equipment and related services in the first half of 2009. &nbsp;Service providers have been hard-hit by eroding sales, financing issues, currency devaluations and considerable uncertainty about future prospects. &nbsp;They have responded by slashing their spending for new equipment and re-focusing their capital expenditures budgets on next-generation technologies that will allow them to offer differentiated services at lower costs. &nbsp;Spending for legacy technologies bore the brunt of capital expenditures cuts as service providers focused less on growing capacity or footprint and more on new ways to enhance the end-user experience with new services. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The transformation of carrier networks to an all-IP (internet protocol) architecture remains a key objective of service provider spending on next-generation technology, even in today&#146;s very challenging economy. &nbsp;The new architecture allows carriers to consolidate multiple networks while delivering differentiated and increasingly video-centric services to their end users. &nbsp;Carrier spending for IP equipment was not immune to recessionary pressures, but it was more resilient than spending for many categories of legacy equipment, and it helped drive continued growth in our IP service router business in the first half of 2009. &nbsp;The ongoing transformation of service provider networks to all-IP also resulted in healthy demand for network and software integration and other professional services offered by us and other vendors. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The heightened focus by service providers on differentiated services helped support their spending for new equipment in other areas as well. &nbsp;Operators continued to invest in the mobile broadband capabilities offered by third generation wireless networks, led by China&#146;s ongoing transformation from 2G to 3G wireless. &nbsp;Activity in our applications software business has also been more resilient than in other segments of our addressable market. &nbsp;That reflects our heightened focus on the delivery of new applications, differentiated services and an improved end-user experience, and our customers&#146; positive response to that focus. &nbsp;Separately, spending on undersea optical networks remained strong in the first half of 2009, as did service provider spending for managed and network operations services (that is, outsourcing). &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The legacy segments of our addressable market fared much worse in the first half of 2009 because, as noted above, that is where service providers focused their spending cuts. &nbsp;Fixed access and legacy switching were already in secular decline, and those declines were exacerbated by additional cuts that reflect a reduced focus on adding capacity. &nbsp;At the same time, service providers continued to plan their migration to the replacement, next-generation technologies that will not just add capacity, but will offer enhanced capabilities as well. &nbsp;Terrestrial optics and second generation wireless are two other areas where spending for additional capacity has been put on hold. &nbsp;In optics, that means a heavier utilization of the capacity that was brought on-stream prior to the current downturn, and in second generation wireless, it is a reflection of the shift in spending to third generation technologies. &nbsp;Finally, spending for in-house e
nterprise communications systems has also been weak, reflecting lower employment, business failures and reduced levels of overall investment spending.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I> <BR>
</I></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Outlook for the second half of 2009. </I>&nbsp;We believe that, in contrast to the significant challenges posed by the global economic environment, there are at the same time positive fundamentals influencing the market for telecommunications equipment and related services, and that this influence will continue. &nbsp;The number of mobile subscribers is increasing, video and data traffic volumes are growing, telephony penetration is increasing, and service providers everywhere are looking to transform their networks to an all-IP based architecture. &nbsp;In addition, communications services are not generally viewed as a discretionary item, but are increasingly seen as an essential service for businesses and consumers. &nbsp;These positive forces have not insulated the communications sector from the impact of the global recession, but they have lessened the blow, and we further believe that they will help to provide the groundwork for the resumption of
 growth once the economy starts to recover. &nbsp;We think that for the global economy that is not likely to happen before the end of 2009 but that in areas like the U.S., however, where the recession was early to take hold, there are signs that the worst part of the economic downturn is behind us and that conditions have started to stabilize. &nbsp;We saw sequential improvement in the U.S. market in the second quarter of 2009, and we expect that market will improve further in the second half. &nbsp;But in areas like Europe, where the onset of recession lagged behind the U.S., signs of stabilization are also lagging behind and recessionary pressures have not yet abated.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In short, service providers are still investing in their networks, but they are spending at reduced levels as they attempt to offset lost revenue and protect cash flow. &nbsp;Carrier capital expenditures is likely to continue below year-ago levels in the second half of 2009, although there are indications that some markets, like the U.S., will see some sequential growth in second-half carrier capital expenditures. &nbsp;Service providers will also continue to invest selectively, foregoing spending that just adds capacity in favor of spending that improves the end-user experience with enhanced capabilities and new, differentiated services.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As a result, we continue to expect the global market for telecommunications equipment and related services to decline between 8% and 12% at constant currency rates in 2009. In order to meet our year-end cost reduction targets, we have taken a number of actions on a regional basis. These actions include headcount reductions, contractor reductions, co-sourcing, facility consolidation, reducing the use of agents, reducing commissions, and finding other operational efficiencies. To date, we estimate that we have achieved approximately 35% of our plan to reduce costs and expenses by Euro 750 million on an exit run rate by the fourth quarter of 2009. &nbsp;We also continue to expect to achieve our target of adjusted operating profit (that is, operating profit before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/loss on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments and excluding the negative non-cash impacts of Lucent&#146;s pu
rchase price allocation) around break-even in 2009. &nbsp;</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Revenues.</I> Revenues totalled &#8364;7,503 million in the first half of 2009, a decline of 5.8% from &#8364;7,965 million in the first half of 2008. Approximately 55% of our revenues are denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar. When we translate these sales into euros for accounting purposes, there is an exchange rate impact based on the relative value of the U.S. dollar and the euro. The increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro in the first half of 2009 compared with the first half of 2008 has tempered the decline in our reported revenues. If there had been a constant euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2009 as compared to the first half of 2008, our consolidated revenues would have declined by approximately 10.9% instead of the 5.8% decrease actually experienced. This is based on applying (i) to our sales made directly in U.S. dollars or currencies linked to U.S. dollars effected during the first half of 20
09, the average exchange rate that applied for the same period in 2008, instead of the average exchange rate that applied for the first half of 2009, and (ii) to our exports (mainly from Europe) effected during the first half of 2009 which are denominated in U.S. dollars and for which we enter into hedging transactions, our average euro / U.S. dollar hedging rate that applied for the same period in 2008. Our management believes that providing our investors with our revenues for the first half of 2009 in constant euro / U.S. dollar exchange rates facilitates the comparison of the evolution of our revenues with that of the industry. The table below sets forth our revenues as reported, the conversion and hedging impact of the euro/U.S. dollar and our revenues at a constant rate:</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Revenues in our Carrier business segment fell at a double-digit rate in the first half of 2009, as recessionary pressures on carrier capital expenditures were reflected to varying degrees on revenue growth across all four divisions that comprise the Carrier segment. &nbsp;Spending cuts were, however, sharply focused on legacy technologies. &nbsp;Our wireline business, for example, reflected pronounced weakness in spending for legacy core switching and, to a lesser extent, legacy ADSL access equipment, and our overall wireline revenues dropped sharply in the first half of 2009. &nbsp;Similarly, in our wireless business, a sharp drop in spending for second-generation GSM equipment significantly outweighed increased spending for third-generation technologies, and overall wireless revenues fell at a double-digit rate. &nbsp;The rate of decline in wireless, however, eased significantly in the second quarter. &nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in our optics and IP divisions
 were more resilient. &nbsp;Optics revenue declined at a mid-single digit rate, as continued weakness in terrestrial optics offset continued strong growth in submarine optics. There was a slight decline in revenues in our IP division as growth in IP/MPLS service routers was offset by the continued secular decline in spending for legacy ATM equipment. &nbsp;Revenues in the Applications software segment increased at a high single-digit rate, driven by strong carrier spending for applications. &nbsp;Activity in our Enterprise segment was also significantly impacted by global economic conditions, and revenues fell at a double-digit rate in the first half of 2009. &nbsp;Revenues in our Services business segment continued to grow in the first half of 2009, led by very strong gains in Managed and Outsourcing solutions. &nbsp;</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In the first half of 2009, 70.5% of our revenue was generated in the Europe and Americas regions, where the challenging economic environment pressured levels of activity across the board and revenue declined 9.3% from the first half of 2008. &nbsp;The Asia Pacific and Rest of World regions accounted for a combined 29.5% of revenue in the first half of 2009, and each region had an increase in first-half revenue of 4% over the year-ago period. &nbsp;More specifically, the United States accounted for 28.8% of revenues, down from 30.2% in the same period in 2008 as revenues fell 10%. &nbsp;Weakness was widespread in that market with just a few areas, including applications and W-CDMA, able to post increased revenues in the face of economic headwinds. &nbsp;Europe accounted for 33.8% of revenues in the first half of 2009 (10.1% in France, 19.6% in Other Western Europe and 4.0% in Rest of Europe), down from 34.6% in the same period in 2008 (8.1% in France, 21.
2% in Other Western Europe and 5.4% in Rest of Europe). Within Europe, revenue increased 18% year-over-year in France due in part to gains in W-CDMA, but fell 13% in Other Western Europe and dropped 29% in Rest of Europe. Weakness in Europe was especially pronounced in our enterprise business, offsetting a few pockets of strength, like our IP/MPLS service routers. Revenues in the Asia Pacific market in the first half of 2009 increased 4% from the same period in 2008, and increased their share of total revenue from 18.3% in 2008 to 20.1% in 2009. &nbsp;Within Asia Pacific, our GSM business was particularly weak and our CDMA and W-CDMA businesses particularly strong, reflecting the transition from 2G to 3G wireless in China. &nbsp;Revenues in Other Americas in the first half of 2009 fell 12% from the same period in 2008 and their share of total revenue slipped from 8.4% to 7.9%. &nbsp;Rest of World increased its share of total revenue to 9.4% in the first half of 2009, up from 8.5% in the same period in 2008, 
and had a 4% increase in revenue. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Gross Profit</I>. In the first half of 2009, gross profit decreased to 32.3% of revenue, or &#8364;2,426 million, compared to 35.5% of revenue or &#8364;2,829 million in the first half of 2008. The decrease in gross profit was mainly driven by lower volumes, unfavourable shifts in product and geographic sales mix, as well as the recovery of the U.S. dollar. Gross profit in the first half of 2009 included (i) the negative impact of a net charge of &#8364;61 million for write-downs of inventory and work in progress; and (ii) the negative impact of a net charge of &#8364;17 million of reserves on customer receivables. Gross profit in the first half of 2008 included (i) the positive impact of a &#8364; 36 million gain from currency hedging; (ii) the positive impact of a &#8364; 20 million gain from the sale of real estate; (iii) the negative impact of a net charge of &#8364;149 million for write-downs of inventory and work in progress; and (iv) the negati
ve impact of a net charge of &#8364;19 million of reserves on customer receivables. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>We sell a wide variety of products in many geographic markets. Profitability per product can vary based on their maturity, the required intensity of R&amp;D and our competitive position. Likewise, profitability per geographic area can vary based on the local competitive environment, our market share and the procurement policy of operators. During the first half of 2009, revenue contraction was generally more pronounced in products and in geographic areas where our profitability has historically been above average. Similarly, the products or areas where we enjoyed revenue growth during the first half of 2009 tend to generate below average margins today. The shift in the product and geographic mix witnessed in the first half of 2009 therefore negatively impacted our gross profit.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>It is very difficult to anticipate the future evolution of the product and geographic mix given our wide offering, contrasted economic trends per geographic area and the volatility in operator capital expenditure. We are nonetheless taking actions in order to offset a potential unfavorable shift in our product and geographic mix. We estimate that these actions, which include the rationalization of technology platforms, savings on the procurement of components and services, the re-engineering of existing products, the improvement of our manufacturing tool and, finally, a complete overhaul of our supply chain, should generate annual savings of &#8364;250 million. This makes up a third of the cost reduction plan of &#8364;750 million that we have currently undertaken.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>We estimate that the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the euro which took place in the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008 had a negative impact on our gross profit as a percentage of revenue. This is due to the fact, we believe, that the weight of the U.S. dollar and of currencies linked to the U.S. dollar is higher as a percentage of the cost of goods sold than it is as a percentage of revenue.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Administrative and selling expenses.</I> For the first half of 2009, administrative and selling expenses were &#8364;1,537 million or 20.5% of revenues compared to &#8364;1,546 million or 19.4% of revenues in the same period in 2008. Included in administrative and selling expenses are non-cash purchase accounting entries resulting from the Lucent business combination of &#8364;61 million in the first half of 2009 and &#8364;58 million in the first half of 2008. They primarily relate to the amortization of purchased intangible assets of Lucent, such as customer relationships. &nbsp;The 0.6% decline in administrative and selling expenses reflects the net impact of conflicting trends &#150; the progress we have made executing on our programs to reduce operating expenses by de-layering our organization and eliminating sales duplication between product groups and regions, which has been largely offset by the unfavourable currency impact of the recovery of 
the U.S. dollar on our U.S. dollar denominated expenses. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Research and development costs.</I> Research and development costs were &#8364;1,345 million or 17.9% of revenues in the first half of 2009, after the capitalization of &#8364;1 million of development expense, a decline of 4.6% from &#8364;1,410 million or 17.7% of revenues after the capitalization of &#8364;57 million of development expense in the same period in 2008. &nbsp;Included in research and development costs are non-cash purchase accounting entries resulting from the Lucent business combination of &#8364;79 million in the first half of 2009 and &#8364;195 million in the first half of 2008. The decrease in purchase accounting entries reflects a decline in the amortization of purchased intangible assets of Lucent, including acquired technologies and in-process R&amp;D, mainly due to the impairment losses accounted for on these intangible assets in 2008. &nbsp;Additionally, research and development costs in the first half of 2008 included a one-
time gain of &#8364;31 million on the sale of intellectual property which was booked against our research and development expense. The 4.6% decline in research and development costs reflects the progress we have made enhancing R&amp;D efficiency by focusing on four key segments &#150; IP, optics, broadband and applications &#150; while we accelerate the shift of our investment toward next-generation platforms, and the reduced impact from purchase accounting for the Lucent business combination. &nbsp;Those two factors have more than offset the unfavorable impacts of the sharp reduction in R&amp;D capitalization, the inclusion of the one-time gain in 2008 and the unfavourable currency impact of the recovery of the U.S. dollar on our dollar denominated expenses. </P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Income (loss) from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments.</I> We recorded a loss from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments of &#8364;(456) million in the first half of 2009 compared to a loss of &#8364;(127) million in the same period of 2008. The larger loss in the first half of 2009 reflects the unfavorable impact of the global recession on volumes and pricing, and lower gross margins, all of which more than offset the favourable impacts of our product cost and fixed cost reduction programs and a decline in the purchase accounting entries booked in the first half of 2009. &nbsp;The purchase accounting entries had a negative, non-cash impact of &#8364;140 million in the first half of 2009 as compared t
o &#8364;256 million in the first half of 2008. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Changes in provisions adversely impacted income (loss) from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments for the first six months of 2009 by &#8364;121 million, of which &#8364;231 million were additional provisions and &#8364;110 million were reversals. Additional product sales reserves (excluding construction contracts) created during the first half of 2009 were &#8364;182 million, while reversals of product sales reserves were &#8364;54 million during the same period. Of the &#8364;54 million in reversals, &#8364;32 million related to reversals of reserves made in respect of warranties due to the revision of our original estimates for these reserves regarding warranty period and costs. This revision was due mainly to (i) the earlier than expected replacement of products under warranty by our customers with more recent technologies and
 (ii) the product&#146;s actual performance leading to fewer warranty claims than anticipated and for which we had made a reserve. In addition, &#8364;10 million of the &#8364;54 million reversal of product sales reserves was mainly related to reductions in probable penalties due to contract delays or other contractual issues or in estimated amounts based upon statistical and historical evidence. The remaining reversals (&#8364;12 million) were mainly related to new estimates of losses at completion. Changes in provisions adversely impacted income (loss) from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of intangible assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments by &#8364;107 million in the first half of 2008, of which additional provisions were &#8364;216 million and reversals were &#8364;109 million. Additional product sales reserves created during the first half of 2008 were &#8364;171 million while reversals of product sales reserves w

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Restructuring Costs.</I> Restructuring costs were &#8364;201 million for the first half of 2009, representing (i) &#8364;113 million of new restructuring plans and adjustments to previous plans; (ii) a valuation allowance and a write off of assets of &#8364;43 million in the aggregate; and (iii) &#8364;45 million of other monetary costs. New restructuring plans cover costs related to the elimination of jobs and to product rationalization and facilities closing decisions. Restructuring costs were &#8364;387 million in the first half of 2008, representing (i) &#8364;367 million of new restructuring plans or adjustments to previous plans; (ii) an asset impairment loss of &#8364;15 million; and (iii) &#8364;5 million of other monetary costs. Our restructuring reserves of &#8364;457 million at June 30, 2009 covered jobs identified for elimination and notified in the first six months of 2009, as well as jobs eliminated in previous years for which total or p
artial settlement is still due, costs of replacing rationalized products, and other monetary costs linked to decisions to reduce the number of our facilities. </P>

<P style="page-break-before:always; margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Impairment of Assets.</I> In the first half of 2009, we had no asset impairment charges booked in this specific line item. In the first half of 2008 we took an impairment of assets charge of &#8364;810 million related to our CDMA business, all of which is related to goodwill. The impairment was due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2008, revenues from our CDMA business declined at a higher pace than the company had estimated. This was due to a large extent to the unexpected, strong reduction in the capital expenditure of a key customer in North America. </P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Post-retirement benefit plan amendment.</I> In the first half of 2009 we booked an additional &#8364;1 million reserve related to litigation, as disclosed in Note 21e (&#8220;Contingencies &#8211; Lucent&#8217;s employment and benefits related cases&#8221;) to our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements, that concerns a previous Lucent healthcare plan amendment.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Income (loss) from operating activities.</I> Income (loss) from operating activities was a loss of &#8364;(658) million in the first half of 2009, compared to a loss of &#8364;(1,343) million in the same period of 2008. The smaller loss from operating activities in the first half of 2009 is mostly due to the combined impact of the absence of any impairment charge as compared with the &#8364;810 million charge taken in 2008, and lower restructuring charges in the first half of 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Finance costs.</I> Finance costs in the first half of 2009 were &#8364;120 million, an increase from &#8364;98 million in the comparable year-ago period. &nbsp;The increase is due to a drop in interest earned, from &#8364;93 million in 2008 to &#8364;38 million in 2009, that was larger than the decline in interest paid, from &#8364;191 million in 2008 to &#8364;158 million in 2009. &nbsp;The 2009 declines in both interest earned and interest paid are largely due to lower levels of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and financial debt. The decrease of interest rates between the first half of 2008 and the corresponding period of 2009 explains also the decrease of interest earned between these two periods. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>

In the first half of 2009, other financial income consisted primarily of (i) a capital gain of &#8364;255 million related to the disposal of Thales shares, (ii) a gain of &#8364;50 million related to the partial repurchase of Lucent&#8217;s 7.75% bond due March 2017, and (iii) a loss of &#8364;175 million related to a change in the estimated future cash flows related to Lucent&#8217;s 2.875% Series A convertible debenture. In the first half of 2008, other financial income consisted primarily of income of &#8364;204 million which represented the difference between the expected financial return on the assets and the interest cost on the obligations of the pension and post-retirement benefit plans, which fell to &#8364;14 million in 2009. The decrease of the pension credit is mainly due to 
the decrease of the expected rate of return and the fair value of the pension plan assets as explained in note 2-g of our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><B><BR></B></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Introduction. </I>On November 30, 2006, Lucent became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcatel. On December 1, 2006, we and Thales signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition by Thales of our ownership interests in two joint ventures in the space sector, our railway signalling business and our integration and services activities for mission-critical systems not dedicated to operators or suppliers of telecommunications services. In January 2007, the transportation and security activities were contributed to Thales, and in April 2007, the sale of our ownership interests in the two joint ventures in the space sector was completed. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Consequently, the following discussion takes into account our results of operations under IFRS for the six month periods ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, both of which include six months of results of operations for Lucent and the UMTS radio access business acquired from Nortel on December 31, 2006. Our results for the first six months of 2007 exclude the businesses transferred in January and April 2007 to Thales.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Revenues</I>. Revenues totalled &#8364;7,965 million in the first half of 2008, a decline of 3.0% from &#8364;8,208 million in the first half of 2007. Approximately 52% of our revenues are denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar. When we translate these sales into euros for accounting purposes, there is an exchange rate impact based on the relative value of the U.S. dollar and the euro. The decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro since 2007 had a significant negative impact on our revenues. If there had been a constant euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2008 as compared to the first half of 2007, our consolidated revenues would have increased by approximately 4.2% instead of the 3.0% decrease actually experienced. This is based on applying (i) to our sales made directly in U.S. dollars or currencies linked to U.S. dollars effected during the first half of 2008, the average exchange rate that applied for the s
ame period in 2007, instead of the average exchange rate that applied for the first half of 2008, and (ii) to our exports (mainly from Europe) effected during the first half of 2008 which are denominated in U.S. dollars and for which we enter into hedging transactions, our average euro / U.S. dollar hedging rate that applied for the same period in 2007. Our management believes that providing our investors with our revenues for the first half of 2008 in constant euro / U.S. dollar exchange rates facilitates the comparison of the evolution of our revenues with that of the industry. The table below sets forth our revenues as reported, the conversion and hedging impact of the euro/U.S. dollar and our revenues at a constant rate:</P>

</TABLE>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In the first half of 2008, the United States accounted for 30.2% of revenues by geographical market, down from 32.6% in the same period in 2007 as revenues fell 10% in that market. &nbsp;The decline in the United States reflected weakness in CDMA and DSL revenues, which was not fully offset by increased sales in W-CDMA, GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Networking), Enterprise and Services. &nbsp;Europe accounted for 34.7% of revenues in the first half of 2008 (8.1% in France, 21.2% in Other Western Europe and 5.4% in Rest of Europe), up from 32.6% in the same period in 2007 (6.1% in France, 21.3% in Other Western Europe and 5.2% in Rest of Europe). &nbsp;Within Europe, revenue increased 28% year-over-year in France due in part to gains in W-CDMA, while revenue fell 4% in Other Western Europe and increased 1% in Rest of Europe. &nbsp;Revenues in the Asia Pacific market in the first half of 2008 fell 4% from the same period in 2007, but were little changed as
 a percent of total revenue (18.3% in 2008 and 18.4% in 2007). &nbsp;Revenues in Other Americas in the first half of 2008 fell 3% from the same period in 2007 but were unchanged at 8.4% of total revenue. &nbsp;Rest of World increased its share of total revenue to 8.5% in the first half of 2008, up from 8.0% in the same period in 2007, and had a 3% increase in revenue. &nbsp;Regionally, growth in our Enterprise business was solid in Asia Pacific as well as in North America, and gains in our GSM business were driven by network expansions in China, India, the Middle East and Africa. We are also seeing stronger than expected demand for W-CDMA mobile access in emerging markets, especially in Asia.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Gross Profit. &nbsp;</I>Despite the year-over-year decline in revenue in the first half of 2008, gross profit increased to 35.5% of revenue, or &#8364;2,829 million, compared to 30.8% of revenue or &#8364;2,524&nbsp;million in the first half of 2007. The increase in gross profit is due to enhanced pricing discipline, which improves our ability to retain the benefits of our product cost reduction programs, and which reflects our ongoing commercial selectivity as we balance our intent to grow share with our focus on profitable growth. &nbsp;The increase in gross profit is also due to the following: As a result of purchase accounting for the Lucent business combination, Lucent&#146;s inventory was revalued to its fair value and such &#147;step-up&#148; in valuation was reversed once the inventory was sold. The reversal of the inventory step-up related to the Lucent business combination began in 2006 and was largely completed in 2007 (wi
th a negative, non-cash impact of &#8364;258 million in the first half of 2007). Consequently, there was minimal impact in the first half of 2008. Gross profit in the first half of 2008 included (i) the positive impact of a &#8364; 36 million gain from currency hedging; (ii) a &#8364; 20 million gain from the sale of real estate; (iii) the &#8364; 12 million negative impact of compensation expense recognized for share-based payments (stock options); (iv) the negative impact of a net charge of &#8364;149&nbsp;million for write-downs of inventory and work in progress; and (v) the negative impact of a net charge of &#8364;19&nbsp;million of reserves on customer receivables. Gross profit in the first half of 2007 included (i) the negative impact of &#8364;130&nbsp;million related to investments in current products and platforms that we will eventually discontinue, but that we continue to enhance in order to meet our commitment to our customers while preparing to converge them into a common platform; (ii) the pos
itive impact of &#8364;34&nbsp;million from a litigation settlement related to business arrangements with a company in Colombia which was subsequently liquidated; and (iii) the &#8364;11&nbsp;million negative impact of compensation expense recognized for share-based payments. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Administrative and selling expenses</I>. &nbsp;For the first half of 2008, administrative and selling expenses were &#8364; 1,546&nbsp;million or 19.4% of revenues compared to &#8364;1,800&nbsp;million or 21.9% of revenues in the same period in 2007. The 14.1% decline in administration and selling expenses reflects the progress we have made executing on our programs to reduce operating expenses, as well as a favourable currency impact on our U.S. dollar denominated expenses. Also contributing to the decrease in administrative and selling expenses was a decline in purchase accounting entries resulting from the Lucent business combination, from &#8364; 158 million in the first half of 2007 to &#8364; 58 million in the first half of 2008. &nbsp;The purchase accounting entries have a negative, non-cash impact, and they primarily relate to the amortization of purchased intangible assets of Lucent, such as customer relationships. &nbsp;Adm
inistrative and selling expenses also included the compensation expense recognized for share-based payments (stock options) of &#8364; 22&nbsp;million in the first half 2008 as compared to &#8364; 25&nbsp;million in the first half of 2007. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Research and development costs</I>. &nbsp;Research and development costs were &#8364; 1,410&nbsp;million or 17.7% of revenues in the first half of 2008, after the capitalization of &#8364; 57&nbsp;million of development expense, compared to &#8364; 1,512&nbsp;million or 18.4% of revenues after the capitalization of &#8364; 89&nbsp;million of development expense in the same period in 2007. The 6.7% decline in research and development costs is due, as was the case for administrative and selling expenses, to the progress we have made executing on our programs to reduce operating expenses, as well as a favourable currency impact on our U.S. dollar denominated expenses. &nbsp;The reported decline in research and development costs would have been 13.4%, except for an increase in the first half of 2008 in purchase accounting entries resulting from the Lucent business combination, from &#8364; 109 million in the first half of 2007 to &#8364;
 195 million in the first half of 2008. &nbsp;The purchase accounting entries have a negative, non-cash impact, and they primarily relate to the amortization of purchased intangible assets of Lucent, such as acquired technologies and in process research and development. &nbsp;Research and development costs included the compensation expense recognized for share-based payments (stock options) of &#8364; 13&nbsp;million in the first half of 2008 and &#8364; 12&nbsp;million in the same period in 2007. &nbsp;Additionally, research and development costs in the first half of 2008 included a one-time gain of &#8364; 31 million on the sale of intellectual property which was booked against our research and development expense.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>One contributor to our reduced operating expenses (including both administrative and selling expenses and research and development costs) in the first half of 2008, compared with the same period of 2007, has been headcount reductions. &nbsp;Company-wide headcount reductions totalled 2,300 in the first half of 2008 versus 3,800 in the same period of 2007, excluding the impact of managed services contracts.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Income (loss) from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments.</I> We recorded a loss from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments of &#8364; 127 million in the first half of 2008 compared to a loss of &#8364; 788&nbsp;million in the same period of 2007. This smaller loss reflects improved pricing discipline, the benefits of our product cost and fixed cost reduction programs and a decline in the purchase accounting entries booked in the first half of 2008, all of which more than offset the impact of lower revenues in the first half of 2008. &nbsp;The purchase accounting entries had a negative, non-cash impact of &#8364; 256 million in the first half of 2008 as compared to &#8364; 525&nbsp;mill
ion in the first half of 2007. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Changes in provisions adversely impacted income (loss) from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments for the first &nbsp;six months of 2008 by &#8364;107 million (of which &#8364;216 were additional provisions and &#8364;109 million were reversals). &nbsp;Additional product sales reserves (excluding construction contracts) created during the first half of 2008 were &#8364;171 million, while reversals of product sales reserves were &#8364;79 million during the same period. &nbsp;Of the &#8364;79 million in reversals, &#8364;29 million related to reversals of reserves made in respect of warranties due to the revision of our original estimates for these reserves regarding warranty period and costs. &nbsp;This revision was due mainly to (i) the earlier than expected replacement of products under warranty by our customer
s with more recent technologies and (ii) the product&#146;s actual performance leading to fewer warranty claims than anticipated and for which we had made a reserve. In addition, &#8364;16 million of the &#8364;79 million reversal of product sales reserves was mainly related to reductions in probable penalties due to contract delays or other contractual issues or in estimated amounts based upon statistical and historical evidence. The remaining reversals (&#8364;34 million) were mainly related to new estimates of losses at completion. Changes in provisions adversely impacted income (loss) from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of intangible assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments by &#8364;153 million in the first half of 2007, of which additional provisions were &#8364;232 million and reversals were &#8364;79 million. Additional product sales reserves created during the first half of 2007 were &#8364;156 million while rev
ersals of product sales reserves were &#8364;51 million.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Restructuring Costs</I>. &nbsp;Restructuring costs were &#8364;387&nbsp;million for the first half of 2008, representing &#8364;367&nbsp;million of new restructuring plans and adjustments to previous plans, an asset impairment loss of &#8364; 15 million and &#8364;5&nbsp;million of other monetary costs. New restructuring plans cover costs related to the elimination of jobs and to product rationalization and facilities closing decisions. Restructuring costs were &#8364;510&nbsp;million in the first half of 2007, representing &#8364;493&nbsp;million of new restructuring plans or adjustments to previous plans and an asset impairment loss of &#8364;17 million. &nbsp;Our restructuring reserves of &#8364;753 million at June 30, 2008 covered 3,600 positions under restructuring, costs of replacing rationalized products, and other monetary costs linked to decisions to reduce the number of our facilities. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Impairment of Assets</I>. &nbsp;In the first half of 2008 we took an impairment of assets charge of &#8364;810&nbsp;million related to our CDMA business, all of which is related to goodwill. &nbsp;The impairment was due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2008, revenues from our CDMA business declined at a higher pace than the company had estimated. &nbsp;This was due to a large extent to the unexpected, strong reduction in the capital expenditure of a key customer in North America. &nbsp;Although there are new opportunities in other geographic areas, the uncertainty regarding spending in North America has led us to make more cautious mid-term assumptions about the results of this business. &nbsp;In the first half of 2007 we had &#8364;426 million of impairment charges that were booked against our 3G W-CDMA assets, reflecting a delay in revenue generation from our 3G W-CDMA assets as compared to our initial expectations and to 
a reduction in margin estimates. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Post-retirement benefit plan amendment</I>. &nbsp;In the first half of 2008 we booked an &#8364;18 million reserve related to ongoing litigation that concerns a previous Lucent healthcare plan amendment (see Note 21 &#8220;Contingencies &#8211; Lucent&#8217;s employment and benefits related cases,&#8221; for more detail). &nbsp;In the first half of 2007 we booked a &#8364; 265 million credit resulting from certain changes to management retiree healthcare benefit plans. Effective January 1, 2008, prescription drug coverage offered to former Lucent management retirees was changed to a drug plan similar to the Medicare Part D program. This change reduces the benefit obligation projected in the first half of 2007 by &#8364; 265 million, net of a &#8364; 211 million elimination of the previously expected Medicare Part D subsidies.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Income (loss) from operating activities</I>. &nbsp;Income (loss) from operating activities was a loss of &#8364;1,343 in the first half of 2008, compared to a loss of &#8364;1,459 in the same period of 2007. &nbsp;Contributing to the smaller loss in 2008 were improved pricing discipline, the benefits of our product cost and fixed cost reduction programs, lower restructuring costs and a decline in the purchase accounting entries booked in the first half of 2008 as compared with the same period in 2007. &nbsp;Offsetting some of those positive impacts on the year-over-year change in the loss from operating activities were a larger impairment charge booked in 2008 and the change due to post-retirement benefit plan amendments, from a significant credit in 2007 to a small expense in 2008. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Finance costs.</I> &nbsp;Finance costs in the first half of 2008 were &#8364;98&nbsp;million and included &#8364;191&nbsp;million of interest paid on our gross financial debt, offset by &#8364;93&nbsp;million in interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In the first six months of 2007 net finance costs of &#8364;81&nbsp;million resulted from &#8364;209&nbsp;million of interest paid on our gross financial debt, offset by &#8364;128&nbsp;million in interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decline in interest paid from the first half of 2007 to the first half of 2008 is due largely to a lower level of gross financial debt, while the decline in interest earned is due largely to a lower level of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. </P>

Other financial income consists largely of the expected financial return on the assets of the pension and post-retirement benefit plans, mainly related to the Lucent pension plan assets. The decline from the first half of 2007 to the first half of 2008 is due largely to a November 2007 re-allocation of the plans&#146; assets which reduced their exposure to equity markets. </P>

<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Reduction of goodwill related to deferred tax assets initially unrecognized</I>. &nbsp;In the first half of 2008 there was no reduction of goodwill related to deferred tax assets that were initially unrecognized. &nbsp;In the same period of 2007 there was a &#8364;189 million reduction of goodwill that was due largely to the post-retirement benefit plan amendment &nbsp;described above.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Income tax (expense) benefit</I>. &nbsp;We had an income tax expense of &#8364;69 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008, compared to an income tax benefit of &#8364;173 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007. &nbsp;The income tax expense for the first half of 2008 resulted from a current income tax charge of &#8364;53 million and a net deferred income tax charge of &#8364;16 million. The &#8364;16 million net deferred tax charge included deferred income tax benefits of &#8364;112 million (related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities accounted for in the purchase price allocation of the Lucent combination), that were more than offset by (i) a &#8364;93 million charge from changes in deferred tax mainly due to the reassessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets in connection with the goodwill impairment test performed in the second quarter of &nbsp;2008; and (ii) a &#8364;35 million deferred tax charge
 related to Lucent&#8217;s post-retirement benefit plans. &nbsp;The &#8364;173 million income tax benefit for the first six months of 2007 resulted from a deferred income tax benefit of &#8364;256 million related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities accounted for in the purchase price allocation of the Lucent combination which was not fully offset by a current income tax expense of &#8364;40 million and a deferred income tax expense of &#8364;43 million. &nbsp;</P>

Segment operating income (loss) is the measure of operating segment profit or loss that is used by our Management Committee to perform its chief operating decision making function, assess performance and allocate resources. It consists of segment (loss) from operating activities before restructuring costs, impairment of intangible assets, gain/(loss) on disposal of consolidated entities and post-retirement benefit plan amendments, excluding the main non-cash impacts of the purchase price allocation (PPA) entries relating to the Lucent business combination. Adding &#147;PPA Adjustments (excluding restructuring costs and impairment of assets)&#148; to segment operating income (loss), as shown in the table below, reconciles segment operating income (loss) with income (loss) from operating activities b

When we translate these sales into euros for accounting purposes, there is an exchange rate impact based on the relative value of the U.S. dollar and the euro. The increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro in the first half of 2009 vs. the first half of 2008 has tempered the decline in our reported revenues. If there had been a constant euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2009 as compared to the first half of 2008, our carrier segment revenues would have declined by approximately 17% instead of the 12.2% decrease actually reported.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Revenues in our Optics division reflected weakness in the terrestrial segment of the market, where the impact of reduced spending was felt across a widening range of technologies as the first half of the year progressed. &nbsp;Our submarine optics business, however, continued to grow at a strong double-digit rate. &nbsp;Revenues for the Optics division were Euro 1,385 million, a 4.3% decline from Euro 1,447 million in the first half of 2008.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>There were contrasting demand trends at play in our Wireless networks division, where revenues of Euro 1,886 million in the first half of 2009 were down 11.9% from the year-ago period. &nbsp;Currency devaluations, economic weakness and the migration to 3G in China had a pronounced impact on carrier spending for legacy technologies in emerging markets, driving a sharp decline in our GSM business. &nbsp;Spending for third generation technologies was much stronger, particularly in China, but a strong double-digit increase in our WCDMA business and some recovery in CDMA activity were not enough to offset the decline in GSM. &nbsp;Finally, the momentum in LTE continues to build: in addition to our selection as one of the two vendors for Verizon, we were selected by several other operators for their LTE trials.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Activity in our Wireline networks division was also materially impacted by the legacy-focused cutbacks in service provider spending for new equipment. &nbsp;Our wireline revenues fell 27.3%, to Euro 817 million in the first half of 2009, driven by pronounced weakness in spending for legacy switching and, to a lesser extent, fixed access technologies.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Carrier applications were a key driver of growth in our applications software segment, particularly in the early part of the first half 2009, with strong gains in spending for rich communications solutions (IMS applications and messaging), subscriber data management, Digital Media &amp; Advertising, and the successful integration of the Motive portfolio. &nbsp;Customer response to the new applications portfolio and to our applications enablement strategy is very encouraging, highlighted by a strong book-to-bill ratio and more than 20 design orders obtained in the first half 2009, mainly in subscriber data management, rich communications and Digital Media &amp; Advertising. &nbsp;From a geographic standpoint, demand remains very strong in North America and strong in Asia Pacific, but more muted in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>There was growth in spending for Genesys, the contact center software activity, in the latter part of the first six months 2009, driven by a surge in demand from the banking sector as well as a major contract with a large Western European operator. &nbsp;This contract highlights the ongoing successful expansion of Genesys from contact centers to customer care, with a particular focus on intelligent workload distribution. </P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Revenues from Enterprise solutions declined in the first half of 2009 as tough economic conditions and constraints in corporate investment sharply impacted the voice telephony market. &nbsp;&nbsp;Spending for data networking solutions picked up in the latter part of the first half of 2009, offsetting some of the weakness in the voice market. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Revenues from industrial components were the most impacted by global market conditions and declined at a rate well in excess of the 16.6% decline registered by the overall enterprise segment in the first half of 2009, highlighting the highly cyclical nature of the underlying activities.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Managed and Outsourcing solutions grew strongly in the first half of 2009, driven by the implementation of many large contracts signed in 2008.

To calculate net cash used by operating activities before changes in working capital, interest and taxes, the net gain or loss is adjusted for interest income/expense, income taxes and non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, impairments, income statement movements in provisions that have no cash impact and repurchases or changes in financial debt fair values), net gain or loss on disposal of non-current assets, changes in fair values and share-based payments.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital, interest and taxes between the first half 2008 and the first half 2009 is partially explained by the impact in the first half 2009 of &#8364; 621 million of non-cash items (amortization, impairment of assets and items related to financial debt) that were included in the net loss attributable to the owners of the parent at June 30, 2009 of &#8364; 388 million, compared to non-cash items of &#8364; 1,405 million in the first half 2008 that notably included impairment losses of &#8364; 810 million recorded at June 30, 2008 on the CDMA activities. The decrease is also explained by a negative adjustment of &#8364; 372 million for the first half 2009 in respect of financial interest, income taxes, gains on disposal of assets and results of discontinued operations (which included &#8364; 129 million for discontinued operations corresponding to the additional purchase pr

This change is explained by an increase in net cash used of &#8364; 270 million in respect of other non-operating assets and liabilities for the first half 2009 compared to net cash used of &#8364; 95 million for these same elements for the first half 2008, partially offset by a &nbsp;decrease in net cash used by operating working capital. </P>

The difference is mainly due to the net cash of &#8364; 1,566 million provided from the disposal of our investment in Thales and to a decrease of &#8364; 161 million in purchases of marketable securities (purchases of &#8364; 104 million for the first half 2009 compared to &#8364; 265 million for the first half 2008).

Since the &#8364;&nbsp;1.4&nbsp;billion facility was established, we have complied every quarter with the financial covenant that is included in the facility.

These amounts do not reflect any amounts that may be recovered under recourse, collateralization provisions in the guarantees or guarantees given by customers for our benefit. In addition, most of the parent company guarantees and performance bonds given to our customers are insured; therefore, the estimated exposure related to the guarantees set forth in the preceding table may be reduced by insurance proceeds that we may receive in case of a claim.</P>

More generally, as part of our business, we routinely enter into long-term contracts, which can involve our customers paying significant amounts over long periods of time.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As of June 30, 2009, net of reserves, we had an exposure of &#8364;&nbsp;320&nbsp;million under drawn customer financing arrangements, representing approximately &#8364;&nbsp;316&nbsp;million of deferred payments and loans, and &#8364;&nbsp;4 million of guarantees. In addition, as of this date, we had further commitments to provide customer financing for approximately &#8364;&nbsp;77&nbsp;million.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Outstanding customer financing and undrawn commitments are monitored by assessing, among other things, each customer&#146;s short-term and long-term liquidity positions, the customer&#146;s current operating performance versus plan, the execution challenges faced by the customer, changes in the competitive landscape, and the customer&#146;s management experience and depth. When we detect potential problems, we take mitigating actions, which may include the cancellation of undrawn commitments. Although by taking such actions we may be able to limit the total amount of our exposure, we still may suffer losses to the extent of the drawn and guaranteed amounts. </P>

Pursuant to these agreements, Lucent and the former affiliates have agreed to allocate certain liabilities related to each other&#146;s business, and have agreed to share liabilities based on certain allocations and thresholds. We are not aware of any material liabilities to Lucent&#146;s former affiliates as a result of the separation agreements that are not otherwise reflected in our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Lucent&#146;s Other Commitments &#150; Contract Manufacturers. </I>Lucent outsources most of its manufacturing operation to electronic manufacturing service (EMS) providers. Until 2008, two EMS providers, Celestica and Solectron (acquired by Flextronics in October&nbsp;2007), had exclusive arrangements with Lucent to supply most of Lucent-designed wireless and wireline products. Although no longer exclusive suppliers, Celestica continues to manufacture most of Lucent&#146;s existing wireless products and Solectron continues to consolidate the outsourced manufacturing of Lucent&#146;s portfolio of wireline products. Lucent generally does not have minimum purchase obligations in its contract-manufacturing relationships with EMS providers and therefore the contractual payment obligations schedule, presented above under the heading &#147;Contractual Obligations&#148;, does not include any commitments related to contract manufacturers.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Lucent&#146;s Guarantees and Indemnification Agreements. </I>Lucent divested certain businesses and assets through sales to third-party purchasers and spin-offs to the other common shareowners of the businesses spun-off. In connection with these transactions, certain direct or indirect indemnifications were provided to the buyers or other third parties doing business with the divested entities. These indemnifications include secondary liability for certain leases of real property and equipment assigned to the divested entity and specific indemnifications for certain legal and environmental contingencies, as well as vendor supply commitments.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent remains secondarily liable for approximately U.S.&nbsp;$&nbsp;72&nbsp;million of lease obligations as of June 30, 2009 (U.S.&nbsp;$&nbsp;119&nbsp;million of lease obligations as of June 30, 2008), that were assigned to Avaya, LSI Corporation (formerly Agere) and purchasers of other businesses that were divested. The remaining terms of these assigned leases and the corresponding guarantees range from one month to 10&nbsp;years. The primary obligor under assigned leases may terminate or restructure the lease obligation before its original maturity and thereby relieve Lucent of its secondary liability.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent is party to a tax-sharing agreement to indemnify AT&amp;T and is liable for tax adjustments that are attributable to its lines of business, as well as a portion of certain other shared tax adjustments during the years prior to its separation from AT&amp;T. Lucent has similar agreements with Avaya and LSI Corporation. Certain proposed or assessed tax adjustments are subject to these tax-sharing agreements. We do not expect that the outcome of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or near-term liquidity.</P>

Each guaranty is unsecured and is subordinated to the prior payment in full of Lucent&#146;s senior debt and is <I>pari passu</I> with Lucent&#146;s other general unsecured obligations, other than those that expressly provide that they are senior to the guaranty obligations.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt;  font-family:Arial" align=justify><I>Customer Credit Approval Process and Risks.</I> &nbsp;We engage in a thorough credit approval process prior to providing financing to our customers or guarantees to financial institutions, which provide financing to our customers. Any significant undertakings have to be approved by a central Trade and Project Finance group and by a central Risk Assessment Committee, each independent from our commercial departments. We continually monitor and manage the credit we have extended to our customers, and attempt to limit credit risks by, in some cases, obtaining security interests or by securitizing or transferring to banks or export credit agencies a portion of the risk associated with this financing.</P>
<P style="margin-top:4.15pt; margin-bottom:2.65pt; text-indent:14.2pt; line-height:12.8pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Although, as discussed above, we engage in a rigorous credit approval process and have taken actions to limit our exposure to customer credit risks, if economic conditions and the telecommunications industry in particular were to deteriorate, leading to the financial failure of our customers, we may realize losses on credit we extended and loans we made to our customers, on guarantees provided for our customers and losses relating to our commercial risk exposure under long-term contracts, as well as the loss of our customer's ongoing business. &nbsp;&nbsp;In such a context, should customers fail to meet their obligations to us, we may experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of reserves, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.</P>

We expect to make capital expenditures in the second half of 2009 of approximately the same amount or slightly more than what we spent in the first half of the year (&#8364;340 million for the first half 2009). We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows and funding arrangements provide us with adequate flexibility to meet our short-term and long-term financial obligations and to pursue our capital expenditure program, as planned. We base our judgment on current and future economic and market conditions. If these conditions were to deteriorate, we could be required to engage in additional restructuring efforts beyond those a
nnounced in July 2009, and to seek additional sources of capital, which may be difficult depending on market conditions and our ability to access credit markets </P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Although, at June 30, 2009, our exposure to financial market risks was not materially different from our exposure at the end of last year, as described in our 2008 Form 20-F, outstanding amounts may vary significantly according to underlying exposures and fair value of derivative instruments changes depending on market conditions. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The only significant change is in the break-down of our gross financial debt between fixed rate debt and floating rate debt. As a result of our hedging transactions, the fixed rate debt part of our gross financial debt represents approximately 90 % of our total gross debt as of June 30, 2009 compared to 56% as of December 31, 2008.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As noted in our 2008 &#150; Form 20-F, we are exposed to credit risk on marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments in the event of counterparty default.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. This is done during the second quarter of the year.

Within Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s reporting structure, Business Divisions are one level below the four operating segments (Carrier, Applications Software, Enterprise and Services).

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>When the reporting structure is reorganized in a way that changes the composition of one or more Business Divisions to which goodwill was allocated, a new impairment test is performed on the goodwill for which the underlying Business Divisions have changed.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Intangible assets mainly include capitalized development costs and those assets acquired in business combinations, being primarily acquired technologies or customer relationships. Intangible assets, other than trade names, are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (i.e. 3 to 10 years). However, software amortization methods may be adjusted to take into account how the product is marketed. Amortization is classified as part of cost of sales, research and development costs (acquired technology, IPR&amp;D, etc.) or administrative and selling expenses (customer relationships), depending on the designation of the asset. Impairment losses are accounted for in a similar manner or in restructuring costs if they occur as part of a restructuring plan or on a specific line item if very material (refer to note 1p). In Process R&amp;D amortization begins once technical feasibility is reached. Certain trade names are considered

In such cases, the acquirer recognizes a deferred tax asset, but does not include it as part of the accounting for the business combination, and therefore does not take it into account in determining the goodwill or the amount of any excess of the acquirer&#146;s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree&#146;s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the combination.</P>

For revenues generated from construction contracts, the Group applies the percentage of completion method of accounting in application of the above principles, provided certain specified conditions are met, based either on the achievement of contractually defined milestones or on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. Any probable construction contract losses are recognized immediately in cost of sales. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance, or the contract&#146;s duration is relatively short, revenues are recognized only to the exten

If the Group is uncertain as to whether economic benefits will flow to the Group, revenue is deferred and recognized on a cash basis. However, if uncertainty arises about the ability to collect an amount already included in revenue, the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable is recognized as an expense in &#147;cost of sales&#148;.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The recoverable values of our goodwill and intangible assets, as determined for the 2009 annual impairment test performed by the Group in the second quarter of 2009, are based on key assumptions which could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. These key assumptions include among others the following elements:</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; padding-left:42.55pt; text-indent:-7.1pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>- discount rate; and</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; padding-left:42.55pt; text-indent:-7.1pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>- projected cash-flows arising out of the successful implementation of the strategic plan the Group publicly announced on December 12, 2008 and on a nominal rate of growth of our revenues in 2010.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The discount rate used for the annual impairment tests of 2009 and 2008 was the Group&#146;s weighted average cost of capital (&#147;WACC&#148;) of 11% and 10% respectively. For the additional impairment test performed during the fourth quarter 2008, the rate used was 12%. These discount rates are after-tax rates applied to after-tax cash flows. The use of such rates results in recoverable values that are identical to those that would be obtained by using, as required by IAS 36, pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows. Given the absence of comparable &#147;pure player&#148; listed companies for each group of Cash Generating Units, we do not believe that the assessment of a specific WACC for each product or market is feasible. A single discount rate has therefore been used on the basis that risks specific to certain products or markets have been reflected in determining the cash flows. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2009 recoverable values of goodwill and intangible assets by &#8364; 373 million and &#8364; 406 million, respectively. An increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would not have impacted impairment losses as of June 30, 2009.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As indicated in note 1g, in addition to the annual goodwill impairment tests, impairment tests are carried out if Alcatel-Lucent has indications of a potential reduction in the value of its goodwill or intangible assets. Possible impairments are based on discounted future cash flows and/or fair values of the assets concerned. Changes in the market conditions or the cash flows initially estimated can therefore lead to a review and a change in the impairment losses previously recorded.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In accordance with IAS 36 &#147;Impairment of Assets&#148;, when events or changes in market conditions indicate that tangible or intangible assets may be impaired, such assets are reviewed in detail to determine whether their carrying value is lower than their recoverable value, which could lead to recording an impairment loss (recoverable value is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) (see note 1g). Value in use is estimated by calculating the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Fair value less costs to sell is based on the most reliable information available (market statistics, recent transactions, etc.).</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>When determining recoverable values of property, plant and equipment, assumptions and estimates are made, based primarily on market outlooks, obsolescence and sale or liquidation disposal values.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>No impairment loss on property, plant and equipment was accounted for during the first six months of 2009.</P>

These provisions are calculated based on historical return rates and warranty costs expensed as well as on estimates. These provisions and subsequent changes to the provisions are recorded in cost of sales either when revenue is recognized (provision for customer warranties) or, for construction contracts, when revenue and expenses are recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity. Costs and penalties ultimately paid can differ considerably from the amounts initially reserved and could therefore have a significant impact on future results.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Pension and post-retirement costs had a &#8364; 72 million net negative effect on &#8220;income (loss) before tax and discontinued operations&#8221; during the first six months of 2009 (&#8364;&nbsp;131 million increase in pre-tax income during the first six months of 2008). </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The weighted average expected rates of return on pension and post-retirement plan assets used to determine Alcatel-Lucent pension and post-retirement credits are established at the beginning of each fiscal year. The decrease in the weighted average expected rates of return on pension and post-retirement plan assets between 2008 and 2009 is mainly due to adjustments in expected future returns based on studies performed by Alcatel-Lucent external investment advisors. Even if the actual financial markets are very volatile, this assumption is required to be a long-term expected rate of return rather than a prediction of the immediate next period performance and is not reviewed every quarter. In addition, these rates that are used to determine the pension expense or income are applied on the opening fair value. For Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s U.S. plans, the pension expense or income is updated every quarter. Therefore, the 2009 second quarter expected return on pl
an assets (accounted for in financial income) for Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s U.S. plans is based on March 31, 2009 plan asset fair values, whereas the expected return on plan assets for non U.S. Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s plans is based on the fair values of plan assets at December 31, 2008. The interest cost associated with the plan liabilities is also impacted by the change in discount rates used to value the plan liabilities. The Group recognized a US$&nbsp;71 million decrease between the first and the second quarters of 2009 in the net pension credit, which is accounted for in &#147;other financial income (loss)&#148; (expected return on plan assets for Alcatel-Lucent&#146;s U.S. plans due to the decline of the plan asset fair values and expected change of the interest cost in relation with the decrease of the liability). On U.S. plans, the Group expects a US$ 65 million increase of the net pension credit to be accounted for in financial result between the 2009 second quarter and the 2009 third quarter.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Plans assets are invested in many different asset categories (such as cash, equities, bonds, real estate, private equity, etc&#133;). In the quarterly update of plan asset fair values, approximately 80% are based on closing date fair values and 20% have a one to three month delay as the fair value of private equity, venture capital, real estate and absolute return investments are not available in a short period. This is standard practice in the investment management industry. Assuming that the June 30, 2009 actual fair value of private equity, venture capital, real estate and absolute return on investments was 10% lower than the ones used for accounting purposes as of June 30, 2009, since the Management Pension Plan has a material investment in these assets classes (and the asset ceiling is not applicable to these plans), equity will be negatively impacted by approximately &#8364;&nbsp;210 million.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>For the purposes of calculating any net pension and post-retirement credit, the discount rates are determined at the beginning of each quarterly period (for significant plans). For the purposes of determining the plan obligations, these rates are determined at the end of each period. Alcatel-Lucent is using a discount rate of 6.44% during fiscal 2009 to determine plan obligations. The change in the discount rate from 2008 was due to increasing long-term interest rates. Discount rates also are somewhat volatile because they are set based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date. The discount rate used to determine the post-retirement benefit costs is slightly lower due to a shorter expected duration of post-retirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and the Alcatel-Lucent net pension and post-retirement credit and profitability, whereas a higher discount rate reduce
s the plan obligations and the Alcatel-Lucent net pension and post-retirement credit and profitability.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The expected rate of return on pension and post-retirement plan assets and the discount rate were determined in accordance with consistent methodologies.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2008 net pension and post-retirement result by approximately &#8364;&nbsp;28&nbsp;million and &#8364;&nbsp;34&nbsp;million, respectively. A 0.5% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the 2008 net pension and post-retirement result by approximately &#8364;&nbsp;133 million. </P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The Group&#8217;s U.S. companies have taken various actions to reduce their share of retiree health care costs, including the shifting or increases of certain costs to their retirees. Health care benefits for employees who retired from Lucent&#146;s predecessor prior to March 1, 1990 are not subject to annual dollar caps on Lucent&#146;s share of future benefit costs. The benefit obligation associated with this retiree group approximated 59% of the total U.S. retiree health care obligation as of December 31, 2008. Management employees who retired on or after March 1, 1990 have paid amounts above the applicable annual dollar caps on Lucent's share of future benefit costs since 2001.</P>

<P style="page-break-before:always; margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Beginning in 2009, the Group participated in a Medicare Private Fee For Service (PFFS) plan for Medicare eligible management retirees in the US. &nbsp;Initially, the Group&#146;s Medicare payments to the PFFS plan is somewhat higher than its Medicare payments to individuals. The Group expects the additional Medicare payments to the PFFS plan to decline by 90% over a 10-year period. However, the decrease for 2010 will be larger than anticipated. The Group expects to reflect this effect during the 2009 third quarter when it finalizes its negotiations with the PFFS plan provider.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent&#146;s collective bargaining agreements were ratified during December&nbsp;2004 and address retiree health care benefits, among other items. Lucent agreed to continue to subsidize these benefits up to the established cap level consistent with current actuarial assumptions. Except for costs attributable to an implementation period that ended on February 1, 2005, costs that are in excess of this capped level are being borne by the retirees in the form of premiums and plan design changes. Lucent also agreed to establish a US$&nbsp;400 million trust that is being funded by Lucent over eight years and managed jointly by trustees appointed by Lucent and the unions. This trust is currently being funded by Section 420 transfers from the over funded Occupational Pension Plan. The trust is being used to mitigate the cost impact on retirees of premiums or plan design changes. The agreements also acknowledge that retiree health care benefits will no longer be
 a required subject of bargaining between Lucent and the unions.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The amount of prepaid pension costs that can be recognized in our financial statements is limited to the sum of (i) the cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses and past service cost, (ii) the present value of any available refunds from the plan, and (iii) any reduction in future contributions to the plan. As Lucent currently intends to use eligible excess pension assets applicable to formerly represented retirees to fund certain retiree healthcare benefits for such retirees, such use has been considered as a reimbursement from the pension plan. The funded status of the formerly represented retiree health care obligation of &#8364;&nbsp;1,607 million as of June 30, 2009 (&#8364;&nbsp;1,479 million as of December 31, 2008), the present value of Medicare Part D subsidies of approximately &#8364;&nbsp;262 million as of June 30, 2009 (as this amount is currently netted in the retiree health care obligation - &#8364;&nbsp;272 million as of December 31, 20
08) and the present value of future service costs of &#8364;&nbsp;46 million as of June 30, 2009 (&#8364;&nbsp;61 million as of December 31, 2008) have been considered in determining the asset ceiling limitation for Lucent's pension plans as of June 30, 2009.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The impact of expected future economic benefits on the pension plan asset ceiling is a complex matter. Based on latest estimates, as of the January 1, 2009 valuation date, there were approximately &#8364;&nbsp;1.8 billion of pension plan assets that would be eligible for &quot;collectively bargained&quot; transfers to fund retiree health care costs for Lucent&#8217;s formerly represented retirees (alternatively, &#8364;&nbsp;2.1 billion would be available for &#8220;multi-year&#8221; transfers, which also require the plan to remain 120% funded during the transfer period). This amount is sufficient to address the obligation arising from the healthcare being provided to Lucent&#146;s formerly represented retirees and as a result the Group should be able to utilize pension plan assets for Section 420 &#147;collectively bargained&#148; or &#147;multi-year&#148; transfers to fund all its health care obligations for Lucent&#146;s formerly represented retirees.
 Changes in plan asset values, funding levels or new legislation could result in significant changes in the asset ceiling that will impact our equity and could impact the ultimate amount of plan assets eligible for Section 420 transfers.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In December 2008, the Group made a Section 420 transfer of US$&nbsp;653 million to cover the health care costs for Lucent's formerly represented retirees for 2008 and nine months of 2009. This had an US$&nbsp;270&nbsp;million positive impact in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2008.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>The impact of the different actuarial assumptions on the level of the funded status could have consequences on the funding requirements and the determination of the asset ceiling, which would affect our ability to make Section 420 transfers in the future and use the overfunding of some pension plans to fund underfunded healthcare plans related to the same beneficiaries.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As indicated in note 1o, revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of a product to the buyer.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>For revenues and expenses generated from construction contracts, the Group applies the percentage of completion method of accounting, provided certain specified conditions are met, based either on the achievement of contractually defined milestones or on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The determination of the stage of completion and the revenues to be recognized rely on numerous estimations based on costs incurred and acquired experience. Adjustments of initial estimates can, however, occur throughout the life of the contract, which can have significant impacts on future net income (loss).</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Although estimates inherent in construction contracts are subject to uncertainty, certain situations exist whereby management is unable to reliably estimate the outcome of a construction contract. These situations can occur during the early stages of a contract due to a lack of historical experience or throughout the contract as significant uncertainties develop related to additional costs, claims and performance obligations, particularly with new technologies. During the fourth quarter of 2007, as a result of cost overruns and major technical problems that we experienced in implementing a large W-CDMA contract, we determined that we could no longer estimate with sufficient reliability the final revenue and associated costs of such contract. As a result, we expensed all the contract costs incurred to that date, but we only recognized revenues to the extent that the contract costs incurred were recoverable. Consequently, revenues of &#8364;&nbsp;72 millio
n and cost of sales of &#8364;&nbsp;298 million were recognized in 2007 in connection with this construction contract. The negative impact on income (loss) before income tax and discontinued operations of changing from the percentage of completion method to this basis of accounting was &#8364;&nbsp;98 million for 2007. No change in the accounting treatment occurred in 2008 and during the first six months of 2009. If and when reliable estimates become available, revenue and costs associated with the construction contract will then be recognized respectively by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the statement of financial position date. Future results of operations may therefore be impacted.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Some of the Group's products include software that is embedded in the hardware at delivery. In those cases, where indications are that software is more than incidental, such as where the transaction includes software upgrades or enhancements, more prescriptive software revenue recognition rules are applied to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. As products with embedded software are continually evolving, as well as the features and functionality of the product driven by software components that are becoming more critical to their operation and success in the market, the Group is continually assessing the applicability of some of the guidance of SOP 97-2 including whether software is more than incidental. Several factors are considered in making this determination including (i) whether the software is a significant focus of the marketing effort or is sold separately, (ii) whether updates, upgrades and other support services are provide
d on the software component and (iii) whether the cost to develop the software component of the product is significant in relation to the costs to develop the product as a whole. The determination of whether the evolution of our products and marketing efforts should result in the application of some of SOP 97-2 guidance requires the use of significant professional judgment. Further, the Group believes that reasonable people evaluating similar facts and circumstances may come to different conclusions regarding the most appropriate accounting model to apply in this environment. Our future results of operations may be significantly impacted, particularly due to the timing of revenue recognition, if we change our assessment as to whether software is incidental, particularly if VSOE or similar fair value cannot be obtained with respect to one or more of the undelivered elements.</P>

Due to the underlying assumptions made in the valuation process, the determination of those fair values requires estimations of the effects of uncertain future events at the acquisition date and the carrying amounts of some assets, such as fixed assets, acquired through a business combination could therefore differ significantly in the future.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As prescribed by IFRS 3, if the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the reporting period in which the combination is effected, the acquirer must account for the business combination using those provisional values and has a twelve-month period to complete the purchase price allocation. Any adjustment of the carrying amount of an identifiable asset or liability made as a result of completing the initial accounting is accounted for as if its fair value at the acquisition date had been recognized from that date. Detailed adjustments accounted for in the allocation period are disclosed in note 3.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Some of our convertible bonds have optional redemption periods/dates before their contractual maturity as described in note 15. All the convertible bonds issues by Alcatel-Lucent were accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 requirements (paragraphs 28 to 32) as described above in note 1-m. Classification of the liability and equity component of a convertible instrument is not revised as a result of a change in the likelihood that a conversion will be exercised. On the other hand, in case of optional redemption periods/dates occurring before the contractual maturity of the debenture, the likelihood of a redemption before the contractual maturity could lead to a change in the estimated payments. As prescribed by IAS 39, if an issuer revises the estimates of payment, due to reliable new estimates, it must adjust the carrying amount of the instrument by computing the present value of remaining cash flows at the original effective interest rate of the financi
al liability to reflect the revised estimated cash flows. The adjustment is recognized as income or expense in profit or loss.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As described in notes 6, 15 and 17, such a change in estimates occurred during the second quarter of 2009 regarding Lucent&#146;s 2.875% Series A convertible debenture. Similar changes in estimates could occur in the future for all convertible debentures with optional redemption periods/dates. The potential impact from a change in the Group&#146;s estimate of redemption triggers on all of Lucent&#146; convertible debt on &#147;other financial income (loss)&#148; will be a loss corresponding to the difference between the present value of the revised estimated cash flows and the carrying amount derived from the split accounting as described in note 1-m. An approximation of the potential negative impact in &#147;other financial income (loss)&#148; is the carrying amount of the equity component, as disclosed in notes 15 and 17.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>If all or some of the holders of Lucent&#146;s 2.875% Series A convertible debentures do not ask for redemption on the first optional redemption date (i.e. on June 15, 2010), the estimated cash flows related to the remaining debt will then be revised accordingly, if new estimates are considered as reliable, with corresponding potential positive impact on &#147;other financial income (loss)&#148;. The initial accounting treatment could then be reinstituted.</P>

The closing of the transaction, subject to regulatory and administrative approvals (mainly relative to antitrust), was foreseen for spring 2009. The carrying value of our shares was therefore reclassified as &#147;assets held for sale&#148; as of December 31, 2008. As the fair value less costs to sell was higher than the carrying value as of December 31, 2008, such carrying value was not adjusted. The amount of the capital gain that would be accounted for in &#147;other financial income (loss)&#148;, after the disposal of our shares had been completed, depended on the definitive amount of Thales&#146; equity as of December 31, 2008, which was not known when
 our 2008 consolidated financial statements were closed. The carrying value of our shares and the share in net income of equity affiliates related to Thales were based upon the available estimates that Thales management provided at the date of publication of the 2008 consolidated financials. The remaining part of the capital gain that was accounted for on our different assets disposed of or contributed to Thales in the past, and which was eliminated as an intra-group transaction, was accounted for also in&#8221;other financial income (loss)&#8221;, as part of the capital gain on the disposal of Thales shares, in the second quarter of 2009, representing a positive impact of &#8364;&nbsp;191 million.</FONT></P>

The share price of Alcatel-Lucent shares will be measured yearly in relation to a representative sample of 14 peer group companies that are solution and service providers in the telecommunications equipment sector (this figure may be revised in line with market changes). The number of vested stock options that will be exercisable will be measured annually in proport
ion to our stock price&#146;s performance as compared to our peer group. This annual measurement will occur over a four-year period, beginning from the grant date. At the Board meeting closest to the end of each twelve month period, our Board, after consultation with the Compensation Committee, will determine whether or not the stock performance target has been met for the prior year, based on an annual study conducted by a third party consulting firm.</FONT></P>

Since the &#8364;&nbsp;1.4 billion facility was established, Alcatel has complied every quarter with the financial covenant that is included in the facility.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>On July&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2008, certain changes to Lucent&#146;s management retiree healthcare benefits were approved by the board of Directors of Lucent Technologies Inc (now known as Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc.) and announced to retirees between August and the beginning of October. Effective January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2009, post-retirement medical benefits for Medicare eligible management participants are provided through a fully insured Medicare Advantage Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS) Plan. Under this plan, the PFFS plan contracts directly with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to provide all Medicare Parts A and B benefits for Medicare eligible management retirees. These changes imply a &#8364;&nbsp;148 million benefit obligation decrease for the management retiree healthcare plan. &#8364;&nbsp;83 million of this decrease, which related to management employees who retired before March&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1990, was considered as a change of actuarial assum
ptions and was recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. &#8364;&nbsp;65 million of this decrease, which related to management employees who retired on or after March&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1990 and who are subject to defined caps, was considered as a plan amendment and was recognized in the 2008 income statement in the specific line item &quot;Post-retirement benefit plan amendments&quot;.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; line-height:11pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Beginning in early October 2004, Alcatel-Lucent learned that investigations had been launched in Costa Rica by the Costa Rican prosecutors and the National Congress, regarding payments alleged to have been made by consultants on behalf of Alcatel CIT, a French subsidiary now called Alcatel-Lucent France (&#147;CIT&#148;), or other Alcatel subsidiaries to various public officials in Costa Rica, two political parties in Costa Rica and representatives of ICE, the state-owned telephone company, in connection with the procurement by CIT of several contracts for network equipment and services from ICE. Upon learning of these allegations, Alcatel commenced an investigation into this matter.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Alcatel terminated the employment of the then-president of Alcatel de Costa Rica in October 2004 and of a vice president Latin America of CIT. CIT is also pursuing criminal actions in France against the latter and in Costa Rica against these two former employees and certain local consultants, based on CIT&#146;s suspicion of their complicity in a bribery scheme and misappropriation of funds. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) and the United States Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;) are aware of the allegations and Alcatel-Lucent has stated it will cooperate fully in any inquiry or investigation into these matters. The SEC and the DOJ are conducting an investigation into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#147;FCPA&#148;) and the federal securities laws. In connection with that investigation, the DOJ and the SEC also have requested information regarding Alcatel&#146;s operations in other cou
ntries. If the DOJ or the SEC determine that violations of law have occurred, they could seek civil or, in the case of the DOJ, criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties against Alcatel-Lucent.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In connection with these allegations, on December 19, 2006, the DOJ indicted the former CIT employee on charges of violations of the FCPA, money laundering, and conspiracy. On March 20, 2007, a grand jury returned</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>a superseding indictment against the same former employee and the former president of Alcatel de Costa Rica, based on the same allegations contained in the previous indictment. On June 11, 2007, the former CIT employee entered into a Plea Agreement in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida and pleaded guilty to violations of the FCPA. On September 23, 2008, the former CIT employee was sentenced to 30 months&#146; imprisonment, three years&#146; supervised release, the forfeiture of U.S. $ 261,500, and a U.S. $ 200 special assessment.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>French authorities are also conducting an investigation of CIT&#146;s payments to consultants in the Costa Rica matter.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Alcatel-Lucent is cooperating with the U.S., French and Costa Rican authorities in the respective investigations described above.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>As further stated in item h below, Alcatel-Lucent has commenced settlement discussions with the DOJ and SEC on this matter.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In connection with the aforementioned allegations, on July 27, 2007, the Costa Rican Prosecutor&#146;s Office indicted eleven individuals, including the former president of Alcatel de Costa Rica, on charges of aggravated corruption, unlawful enrichment, simulation, fraud and others. Three of those individuals have since pled guilty. Shortly thereafter, the Costa Rican Attorney General&#146;s Office and ICE, acting as victims of this criminal case, each filed amended civil claims against the eleven criminal defendants, as well as five additional civil defendants (one individual and four corporations, including CIT) seeking compensation for damages in the amounts of U.S. $ 52 million (in the case of the Attorney General&#146;s Office) and U.S. $ 20 million (in the case of ICE). The Attorney General&#146;s claim supersedes two prior claims, of November 25, 2004 and August 31, 2006. On November 25, 2004, the Costa Rican Attorney General&#146;s Office commenc
ed a civil lawsuit against CIT to seek pecuniary compensation for the damage caused by the alleged payments described above to the people and the Treasury of Costa Rica, and for the loss of prestige suffered by the Nation of Costa Rica (social damages). The ICE claim, which supersedes its prior claim of February 1, 2005, seeks pecuniary compensation for the damage caused by the alleged payments described above to ICE and its customers, for the harm to the reputation of ICE resulting from these events (moral damages), and for damages resulting from an alleged overpricing it was forced to pay under its contract with CIT. During preliminary court hearings held in San Jos&#233; during September 2008, ICE filed a report in which the damages allegedly caused by CIT are valued at U.S. $ 71.6 million. No formal notice of a revised civil claim has so far been received by CIT.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Alcatel-Lucent intends to defend these actions vigorously and deny any liability or wrongdoing with respect to these claims.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Additionally, in August 2007, ICE notified CIT of the commencement of an administrative proceeding to terminate the 2001 contract for CIT to install 400,000 GSM cellular telephone lines (the &#147;400KL GSM Contract&#148;), in connection with which ICE is claiming compensation of U.S. $ 59.8 million for damages and loss of income. By March 2008, CIT and ICE concluded negotiations of a draft settlement agreement for the implementation of a &#147;Get Well Plan,&#148; in full and final settlement of the above-mentioned claim. This settlement agreement was not approved by ICE&#146;s Board of Directors that resolved, instead, to resume the aforementioned administrative proceedings to terminate the operations and maintenance portion of the 400KL GSM Contract, claim penalties and damages in the amount of U.S. $ 59.8 million and call the performance bond. CIT was notified of this ICE resolution on June 23, 2008. ICE has made additional damages claims and penalty
 assessments related to the 400KL GSM Contract that bring the overall exposure under the contract to U.S. $ 78.1 million in the aggregate, of which ICE has collected U.S. 5.9 million.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In June 2008, CIT filed an administrative appeal against the resolution mentioned above. ICE called the performance bond in August 2008, and on September 16, 2008 CIT was served notice of ICE&#146;s request for payment of the remainder amount of damages claimed, US$ 44.7 million. On September 17, 2008, the Costa Rican Supreme Court ruled on the appeal filed by CIT stating that: (i) the US$ 15.1 million performance bond amount is to be reimbursed to CIT and (ii) the US$ 44.7 million claim is to remain suspended until final resolution by the competent Court of the case. Following a clarification request filed by ICE, the Court finally decided that the US$ 15.1 million performance bond amount is to remain deposited in an escrow account held by the Court, until final resolution of the case. On October 8, 2008 CIT filed a claim against ICE requesting the court to overrule ICE&#146;s contractual resolution regarding the 400KL GSM Contract and claiming compensa
tion for the damages caused to CIT. In January 2009, ICE filed its response to CIT&#146;s claim. At a Court hearing on March 25, 2009, ICE ruled out entering into settlement discussions with CIT. On April 20, 2009 CIT filed a petition to the Court to recover the $ 15.1 million performance bond amount and offered the replacement of such bond with a new bond that will guarantee the results of the final decision of the Court. A hearing originally scheduled for June 1, 2009 was suspended due to ICE&#146;s decision not to present to the Court the administrative file wherein ICE decided the contractual resolution of the 400KL GSM Contract. A new court hearing has been scheduled for September 29, 2009.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>On October 14, 2008, the Costa Rican authorities notified CIT of the commencement of an administrative proceeding to ban CIT from government procurement contracts in Costa Rica for up to 5 years.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Alcatel-Lucent is unable to predict the outcome of these investigations and civil lawsuits and their effect on CIT&#146;s business. If the Costa Rican authorities conclude criminal violations have occurred, CIT may be banned from participating in government procurement contracts within Costa Rica for a certain period. Alcatel-Lucent expects to generate approximately &#8364; 3 million in revenue from Costa Rican contracts in 2009. Based on the amount of revenue expected from these contracts, Alcatel-Lucent does not believe a loss of business in Costa Rica would have a material adverse effect on the Alcatel-Lucent group as a whole.

It has been alleged that persons in Taisel, Alcatel-Lucent Deutschland AG (a German subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent involved in the Taiwan Railway contract), Siemens Taiwan, and subcontractors hired by them were involved in a bid-rigging and illicit payment arrangement for the Taiwan Railways contract. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Upon learning of these allegations, Alcatel commenced and is continuing an investigation into this matter.

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>On November&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2005, the Taipei criminal district court found Taisel not guilty of the alleged violation of the Government Procurement Act.

Lucent cooperated with those agencies. On December&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2007, Lucent entered into agreements with the DOJ and the SEC to settle their respective investigations.

The plaintiffs in this case allege that Lucent failed to maintain health care benefits for retired management employees for each year from 2001 through 2006 as required by the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the Lucent pension and medical plans. Upon motion by Lucent, the court remanded the claims to Lucent&#146;s claims review process. A Special Committee was appointed and reviewed the claims of the plaintiffs and Lucent filed a report with the Court on December&nbsp;28,&nbsp;2006.

d Circuit Court of Appeals in its discretion. This request was denied.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims for each year and intends to continue to defend this case vigorously. However, as a result of the court&#146;s findings for 2003, Lucent established a provision for US$ &nbsp;27&nbsp;million during the second quarter of 2008. The amount was determined based on internal estimates from 2002 of the potential impact of the benefit plan changes for the 2003 plan year. At December 31, 2008, Lucent increased this provision to US$ 29.4 million based upon an initial review of actual claims data for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003. &nbsp;Based upon further ongoing analysis of the claims data as this litigation has progressed, however, Lucent now believes that the impact of the 2003 benefit plan changes, during fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, is US$ 28 million. Lucent is currently unable to determine the actual impact of the related benefit plan changes for the 2003 plan year because, even i
f Lucent is finally determined to be liable, the method of determining damages to participants has not been determined. Although the plaintiffs have alleged damages in excess of the amount provided for by Lucent, Lucent believes that those amounts are without merit. Because of the court&#146;s directions with respect to years other than 2003, Lucent has not reflected any provision for plan years other than 2003.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In September 2004, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a purported class action lawsuit against Lucent,<I> EEOC v. Lucent Technologies Inc</I>., which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The case alleges gender discrimination in connection with the provision of service credit to a class of present and former Lucent employees who were on maternity leave prior to 1980 and seeks the restoration of lost service credit prior to April&nbsp;29,&nbsp;1979, together with retroactive pension payment adjustments, corrections of service records, back pay and recovery of other damages and attorneys fees and costs. The case was stayed pending the disposition of another case raising similar issues, which was recently decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in favor of the employer. As a result of this development, the EEOC voluntarily dismissed this case with the court&#146;s approval on July 27, 2009.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent implemented various actions to address the rising costs of providing retiree health care benefits and the funding of Lucent pension plans. These actions led to the filing of cases against Lucent and may lead to the filing of additional cases. &nbsp;Two purported class action lawsuits were prosecuted against Lucent in connection with the elimination of the death benefit from its U.S. management pension plan in early 2003. The elimination of this benefit reduced Lucent future pension obligations by US$ 400 million. The benefit was paid out of the pension plan assets to certain qualified surviving dependents, such as spouses or dependent children of management retirees. These cases alleged that Lucent wrongfully terminated this death benefit and requested that it be reinstated, along with other remedies. The two death benefit cases have now been dismissed by separate U.S. circuit courts of appeals (i.e., the Third Circuit and the Tenth Circuit). The 
matters are now closed.</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent, Microsoft and Dell have been involved in a number of patent lawsuits in various jurisdictions. In the summer of 2003, certain Dell and Microsoft lawsuits in San Diego, California, were consolidated in federal court in the Southern District of California. The court scheduled a number of trials for groups of the Lucent patents, including two trials held in 2008. In one of these trials, on April&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2008, a jury awarded Alcatel-Lucent approximately US$ 357 million in damages for Microsoft&#146;s infringement of the &#147;Day&#148; patent, which relates to a computerized form entry system. &nbsp;On June 19, 2008, the Court entered judgment on the verdict and also awarded prejudgment interest exceeding US$ 140 million. &nbsp;The total amount awarded Alcatel-Lucent relating to the Day patent exceeds US$&nbsp;497 million.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>On December 15, 2008, Microsoft and Alcatel Lucent executed a settlement and license agreement whereby the parties agreed to settle the majority of their outstanding litigations. This settlement included dismissing all pending patent claims in which Alcatel Lucent is a defendant and provided Alcatel Lucent with licenses to all Microsoft patents-in-suit in these cases. Also, on May 13, 2009, Alcatel Lucent and Dell agreed to a settlement and dismissal of the appeal issues relating to Dell from the April, 2008 trial. &nbsp;Only the appeal relating to the Day patent against Microsoft filed by it, and the appeal filed by Lucent relating to the district court&#146;s decision to dismiss certain additional claims with respect to the Day patent, remain currently pending in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Oral Argument was held at the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. on June 2, 2009 and a decision on these appeals is expected in the third or four
th quarter of this year.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>In a parallel proceeding, Dell filed a reexamination of the Day patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;Patent Office&#148;) in May of 2007 alleging that prior art existed that was not previously considered in the original examination and the Day patent should therefore be re-examined for patentability. &nbsp;On June 22, 2009, the Patent Office issued its latest advisory opinion rejecting the two claims of the Day patent at issue in the April &nbsp;2008 trial in view of the prior art. &nbsp;This decision by the examiner does not mean there is an ultimate determination of invalidity by the Patent Office or moot the appeal by Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent in the court case. &nbsp;On July 24, 2009, Alcatel-Lucent filed a notice of appeal of the decision by the examiner to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. &nbsp;</P>

<P style="margin:0pt; font-family:Arial" align=justify>Lucent was a defendant in an adversary proceeding originally filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware by Winstar and Winstar Wireless, Inc. in connection with the bankruptcy of Winstar and various related entities. The trial for this matter concluded in June 2005. The trial pertained to breach of contract and other claims against Lucent, for which the trustee for Winstar was seeking compensatory damages of approximately US$ 60 million, as well as costs and expenses associated with litigation. The trustee was also seeking recovery of a payment Winstar made to Lucent in December 2000 of approximately US$ 190 million plus interest. The trustee also sought to invalidate Lucent&#146;s priority claim to an escrow account worth approximately U.S.$23 million On December&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2005, the judge rendered his decision and the verdict resulted in a judgment against Lucent for approximately US$ 244 million, plus statutory interest and other costs. As a result
, Lucent recognized a U.S.$ 315 million provision (including related interest and other costs of approximately U.S.$ 71 million) as of December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2008. In addition, U.S.$ 328 million of cash collateralized a letter of credit that was issued during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 in connection with this matter. On April&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware affirmed the decision of the Bankruptcy Court. Lucent appealed this decision with the United States Court of Appeals. On February 3, 2009, the Court issued its opinion affirming the District Court&#146;s Order with </P>

On February 20, 2009, Lucent and the Trustee entered into a settlement agreement, which the Court approved on March 25, 2009. Pursuant to this settlement, the Trustee received U.S.$&nbsp;320 million, consisting of the proceeds of the letter of credit and a portion of the escrow account. The balance of the escrow was released to Lucent and the excess restricted cash securing the letter of credit was released from such restriction. This settlement resolves this matter.</P>
