 seabed-to-surface April 15, 2009 slide 2 Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this presentation may include “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E
of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements may be identified by
the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,”
and similar expressions.  The forward- looking statements reflect our current
views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties.  The following
factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and
future results and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking statements:
the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which
we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and
administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in
operating internationally; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards,
including spills and environmental damage.  Many of these factors are beyond our
ability to control or predict.  Given these factors, you should not place undue
reliance on the forward-looking statements.

 seabed-to-surface April 15, 2009 slide 18 Adjusted EBITDA           The group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings
before interest, income  taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from
continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation,  depreciation
and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted  EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from
continuing operations.  Management  believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational  strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from
continuing operations have not been  prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as endorsed for use in the  European Union.  These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison
amongst our various regions, as they  eliminate the effects of financing and
depreciation.  Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to  compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following
the group’s performance.  However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from
continuing operations as presented by the group may not be comparable  to similarly
titled measures reported by other companies.  Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with  current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) that apply to reports  filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.  Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented
in this release, or not be presented  at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS  and
should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a  measure of the group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in
accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the  group’s liquidity.  The
reconciliation of the group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing  operations is included in this release.  This release also includes a supplemental calculation
of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing  operations calculated as net operating income from
continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges  on
property, plant and equipment.  Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing  operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures
by companies within Acergy’s peer group  and therefore believes it to be a helpful
calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry.  Adjusted EBITDA for  discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above.  Adjusted EBITDA for
total operations is the total of continuing  operations and discontinued operations.
