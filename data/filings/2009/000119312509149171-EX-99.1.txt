operational performance and our ability to translate project execution into Group margins. We remain on course to deliver results for the year in line with expectations.  While our visibility for conventional work in West Africa has recently improved somewhat with the award of the EPC4A contract, the SURF market has become more challenging with sporadic order flow and more aggressive
competition. I continue to be cautious for the short-term but, in spite of the uncertainties of the present business environment, I remain confident that Acergy is well positioned to successfully manage through this market cycle.”

  Operating Review  Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $207.9 million (Q2 2008: $375.3 million) reflecting fewer major deepwater projects in installation phase compared with the
very high level of activity in the comparable quarter in 2008. A number of major projects, including Pazflor, ALNG and EPC4A remain in early stages. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $41.1 million (Q2 2008: $82.7
million) reflecting lower activity levels and the absence of any major projects completing during the quarter.  Acergy Northern Europe and Canada
– Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $130.6 million (Q2 2008: $210.3 million) reflecting lower activity levels in a challenging market environment. Good operational progress was made on Dong Nini, Tyrihans
Subsea Installation and Deep Panuke, which remained in early stages. Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $4.5 million (Q2 2008: net operating income of $32.4 million), reflecting lower activity levels due to current
market conditions and a charge taken on the Marathon Volund Project ahead of completion of commercial settlement.  Acergy North America and
Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $29.2 million (Q2 2008: $0.9 million) reflecting the contribution from the offshore installation phase of the Perdido Project. Net operating income from
continuing operations for the quarter was $8.1 million (Q2 2008: $5.6 million) primarily due to good progress on the cross-regional Frade Project and contribution from the Perdido Project.  Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $100.7 million (Q2 2008: $75.3 million) driven by strong revenue
contribution from the Frade Project and the Roncandor Manifolds Project. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $10.3 million (Q2 2008: $11.2 million) arising from good performance on SURF activities partly offset by the
lower utilisation on the Acergy Condor, due to thruster problems.  Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing
operations for the second quarter was $53.7 million (Q2 2008: $43.2 million) reflecting good progress on projects, including Van Gogh which completed its offshore phase during the quarter and Pluto, which remains in early stages. Net operating
income from continuing operations was $14.9 million (Q2 2008: $8.2 million) reflecting good project performance and a positive contribution from the SapuraAcergy Joint Venture.  Joint Ventures  The SapuraAcergy Joint Venture successfully completed the Mumbai High South Re-development Phase 2
Project in India during the quarter. The Joint Venture was awarded the $825 million Gumusut-Kakap contract in Malaysia from Shell and the $60 million contract from Nippon Steel Engineering Co. Ltd for the Iwaki Platform Decommissioning Project in
Japan.  Discontinued operations  Net income from
discontinued operations for the second quarter was $0.9 million (Q2 2008: net loss of $28.4 million) due to the small positive contribution from the Mexilhao Trunkline Project during a period of relatively low activity.  Asset Development  In line with the Angolan Government’s policy
of promoting the development of local private Angolan companies, Acergy and Sonangol have agreed to reduce their shareholdings in Sonamet. Post completion of the sale and transfer of shares, expected later this year, Acergy will remain the largest
shareholder with 36% and will continue to manage the Lobito fabrication yard. At that time, the businesses will be deconsolidated from Acergy’s financials and its future results reported as share of results of associates and Joint Venture. The
Joint Ventures are now classified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet at the quarter end.

  Financial Review  Revenue
from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2009 was $526 million (Q2 2008: $706 million) primarily reflecting anticipated lower activity levels in West Africa as fewer major deepwater projects were in offshore installation phase and lower
activity levels in the North Sea which were partially offset by good activity levels in Brazil and Asia Pacific.  Gross profit was $128 million (Q2 2008:
$182 million) reflecting the lower activity levels and portfolio mix as fewer major deepwater project were in installation phase or completed during the quarter, compared to 2008. This was partially offset by good project execution and broadly
similar vessel utilisation during the quarter.  Administrative expenses were $55 million (Q2 2008: $62 million) reflecting favourable exchange rate
movements and the start of cost reduction initiatives.  Acergy’s share of results from associates and joint ventures was $9 million (Q2 2008: $14
million) reflecting a lower contribution from NKT Flexibles and a small loss from Seaway Heavy Lifting, partially offset by a positive contribution from SapuraAcergy.  The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the three months was 21.5% (Q2 2008: 23.1%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 21.1% (Q2 2008: 18.0%).  Income before taxes from continuing operations for the second quarter was $85 million (Q2 2008: $131 million) reflecting the lower activity levels and the lower
contribution from associates and joint ventures.  Taxation for the quarter was $9 million (Q2 2008: $41 million) reflecting an effective tax rate for the
quarter of 11% (Q2 2008: 31%). The underlying effective tax rate for the Group was 35% in the quarter. During the reporting period resolution of a number of ongoing audits were achieved, including a substantial element of the French tax audit and
the UK tonnage tax enquiry. As a consequence certain provisions were released in the quarter.  Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter
was $76 million (Q2 2008: $90 million). Net income from total operations for the second quarter was $77 million (Q2 2008: $62 million).  The cash and cash
equivalents position at the quarter end was $696 million (Q1 2009: $678 million). Deferred revenue, at the quarter end stood at $264 million (Q1 2009: $272 million). Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2009 included cash
balances of $48 million related to Sonamet which, at the end of the second quarter of 2009, were classified as assets held for sale and thus not reflected in the cash and cash equivalents.  At quarter end, Acergy S.A. held directly 11,178,508 treasury shares representing 5.73% of the total number of issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121
treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares. Total shares in issue were 194,953,972, including these treasury shares.  Backlog  Backlog for continuing operations as at May 31, 2009 was approximately $2.4 billion, of which $0.9 billion is expected to be
executed in the remainder of fiscal year 2009. This backlog figure does not include the backlog relating to associates and joint ventures.

  Trading Outlook  The
business environment in which we operate has remained challenging. Some clients are still delaying large SURF projects and our short-term visibility on this market remains poor which, together with keener competition for new tenders, will adversely
affect near-term margins. We have been pleased to see progress in the conventional market in West Africa and expect further progress in the coming quarters, vindicating our strategy to maintain focus in this area.  The medium-term market fundamentals remain strong. As demand growth returns, and with field depletion increasing, the need to access new reserves and replenish
production will return our markets to growth. We remain confident that our skills and strengths meet our clients’ strategic needs, particularly in the development of hydrocarbon discoveries secured in frontier acreage. We believe that
we are well placed, both financially and operationally, to exploit new growth areas, such as Brazil, while recognising that other regions have an evolving significance for the Group. ************************************************************************************************************  Acergy S.A. is
a seabed-to-surface engineering and construction contractor to the offshore oil and gas industry worldwide. We provide integrated services, and we plan, design and deliver complex projects in harsh and challenging environments.  ************************************************************************************************************

  (a) Adjusted EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations
(adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment
income and impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as endorsed for use in the European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as they eliminate the effects
of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the Group’s performance.
However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in
accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the SEC may require that
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing
operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s operating results or cash
flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity. The reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is included in
this release. This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property,
plant and equipment. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer
group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total
operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.  Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this
announcement may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use of words like
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and
similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the approximate value of the awarded contracts, our anticipated performance for fiscal year 2009, our ability to manage our business through this market cycle,
the expected reduction of our shareholdings in two Angolan joint ventures and the expected timing and impact thereof, expectations regarding our backlog and pre-backlog and statements contained in the “Current Trading and Outlook” section,
including the expected impact on our margins, the expected progress in and our continued focus on the conventional market in Nigeria, the expected return to growth of our market and the timing thereof, our ability to exploit new growth areas, such
as Brazil, the strength of the long-term market fundamentals and statements as to management’s confidence that we are well suited to our clients’ strategic needs. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and
are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results and trends
to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant
clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of
laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

•
For the three months ended May 31 2009 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible note is to reduce the diluted EPS from $0.411 to $0.405 (Q2 2008: $0.353 to $0.352). This is
said to be dilutive and is therefore included in the calculation. 


•
For the six months ended May 31 2009 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible note would be to increase the diluted EPS from $0.613 to $0.620 (Q2 2008: $0.550 to $0.561).
This is anti-dilutive and is therefore not included in the calculation.
