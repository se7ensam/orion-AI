  QUARTERLY MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS      UNITED STATES GAAP      (all figures are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise noted and  all units of measurement expressed in metric unless
otherwise noted)        


 Results of Operations  

        Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited ("Agnico-Eagle" or the "Company") reported first quarter net income of $54.3 million, or $0.35 per
share, compared to net income of $28.9 million, or $0.20 per share, in the first quarter of 2008. Gold production in the first quarter of 2009 increased to 91,812 ounces from
50,892 ounces in the first quarter of 2008 due to the commencement of production at the Goldex Mine. Cash provided from operating activities was $48.8 million in the first quarter of
2009 compared to $54.6 million in the prior year's first quarter. 


        The
table below summarizes the key variances in net income for the first quarter of 2009 from the net income reported for the same period in 2008.

        In
the first quarter of 2009, revenues from mining operations decreased to $105.8 million from $119.1 million in the first quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2009,
there were significant decreases in realized prices for all metals when compared to the same period in 2008. This was partially offset by the additional production of gold at the Company's new Goldex
Mine. During the first quarter of 2009, the Goldex Mine produced 35,959 ounces of gold. 

        In
the first quarter of 2009, total cash costs per ounce increased to $312 per ounce of gold produced from $(399) per ounce in the first quarter of 2008. The main driver leading
to the increase in total cash costs for the quarter was significantly lower byproduct revenue due to lower realized sales prices on zinc, copper and silver.

Notes: 


(i)Under
the Company's revenue recognition policy, revenue is recognized on concentrates when legal title passes. Since total cash costs are calculated on a
production basis, this inventory adjustment reflects the sales margin on the portion of concentrate production for which revenue has not been recognized in the period.
(ii)Total
cash costs is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. The Company
believes that this generally accepted industry measure is a realistic indication of operating performance and is useful in allowing year over year comparisons. As illustrated in the table above, this
measure is calculated by adjusting Production Costs as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for net byproduct revenues, inventory adjustments and asset retirement
provisions. This measure is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management uses this measure to monitor the
performance of the Company's mining operations. Since market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using this per ounce measure allows management to assess the mine's cash generating
capabilities at various gold prices. Management is aware that this per ounce measure of performance can be impacted by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and exchange rates. Management compensates
for the limitation inherent with this measure by using it in conjunction with the minesite costs per tonne measure (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating metal prices and exchange rates.
(iii)This
inventory adjustment reflects production costs associated with unsold concentrates.
(iv)Minesite
costs per tonne is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. As
illustrated in the table above, this measure is calculated by adjusting Production Costs as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for inventory and hedging
adjustments and asset retirement provisions and then dividing by tonnes processed through the mill. Since total cash costs data can be affected by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and exchange
rates, management believes minesite costs per tonne provides additional information regarding the performance of mining operations and allows management to monitor operating costs on a more consistent
basis as the per tonne measure eliminates the cost variability associated with varying production levels. Management also uses this measure to determine the economic viability of mining blocks. As
each mining block is evaluated based on the net realizable value of each tonne mined, in order to be economically viable the estimated revenue on a per tonne basis must be in excess of the minesite
costs per tonne. Management is aware that this per tonne measure is impacted by fluctuations in production levels and thus uses this evaluation tool in conjunction with production costs prepared in
accordance with US GAAP. This measure supplements production cost information prepared in accordance with US GAAP and allows investors to distinguish between changes in production costs
resulting from changes in production versus changes in operating performance. 

        Also during the first quarter of 2009, there was a significant tax benefit amounting to $25.0 million compared to a tax expense of
$22.3 million during the same period in 2008. This was due to the Company's election to commence using the US dollar as its functional currency for federal Canadian income tax purposes and the
net tax benefit realized from the issuance of the 2008 flow through shares. 


 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

        At March 31, 2009, Agnico-Eagle's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totalled
$208.4 million, while working capital was $333.3 million. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $99.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments
and restricted cash and $178.2 million in working capital. The Company's policy is to invest excess cash in highly liquid investments of the highest credit quality to eliminate any risks
associated with these investments. Such investments with remaining maturities at time of 

3




 


purchase
greater than three months are classified as short-term investments and decisions regarding the length of maturities are based on cash flow requirements, rates of returns and
various other factors. 

        Cash
provided by operating activities was $48.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $54.6 million in the first quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of
2009, revenues from mining operations decreased to $105.8 million from $119.1 million in the first quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, there were significant decreases in
realized prices for all metals when compared to the same period in 2008. This was partially offset by the additional production of gold at the Company's new Goldex Mine. During the first quarter of
2009, the Goldex Mine produced 35,959 ounces of gold. 

        For
the three months ended March 31, 2009, capital expenditures were $155.3 million compared to $158.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2008. The
significant capital expenditures during the first
quarter of 2009 pertained to the Meadowbank, Pinos Altos and Lapa projects. Since the Kittila project has not yet achieved commercial production, all minesite costs are continuing to
be capitalized. 

        During
the first quarter of 2009, the Company drew down an additional $215 million from its bank debt facilities. As of March 31, 2009, the Company has $185 million
in undrawn credit lines. The amount available under the facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit amounting to $55.4 million, and therefore, the amount available as of
March 31, 2009, is approximately $129.6 million. The facility requires the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet financial condition covenants. Letters of credit issued
as collateral for pension and environmental obligations decrease the amount available under the facility. 


        Also
during the first quarter of 2009, $28.9 million of common shares were issued which was attributable to the exercising of stock options and the 2008 issuance of flow through
shares. In addition, the Company paid its entire 2008 dividend amounting to $27.1 million during the first quarter of 2009. 

        The
recent unprecedented events in the global financial markets have had a profound impact on the global economy. Virtually all industries, including the gold mining business, are
impacted by these market conditions. Some of the key impacts of the current market turmoil include: a sharp contraction in the credit markets resulting in a widening of credit risk spreads and higher
costs of funding; a deterioration in the credit ratings of a number of large financial institutions; devaluations and high volatility in global equity, commodity, foreign exchange and precious metals
markets and a corresponding lack of market liquidity; and a slowdown in economic activity that is affecting major global economies. These events could have a significant impact on our business.
In particular, the global credit/liquidity crisis could impact the cost and availability of financing and our overall liquidity. The devaluation and volatility in gold, silver, zinc and
copper prices impacts the amount of our revenues, and our earnings and cash flow. Volatile energy prices, commodity and consumables prices and currency exchange rates impact our production
costs. The devaluation and volatility of global stock markets impacts the valuation of our equity investments.

    AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            (thousands of United States dollars except share and per share amounts, unless
otherwise indicated)  (Unaudited)  March 31, 2009        


 1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION  



The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") in US dollars. They do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. Accordingly, these unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2008 annual consolidated financial statements, including the accounting policies and notes thereto, included in the Annual Report and Annual
Information Form/Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2008. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as at March 31, 2009 and the results of operations and cash flows for the
three months ended March 31, 2009, and 2008. 

Operating
results for the three months period ended March 31, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2009. 



 2.     USE OF ESTIMATES  



The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ
from these estimates. 



 3.     ACCOUNTING POLICIES  



These
interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the December 31, 2008 audited annual consolidated financial statements
except for the changes discussed below. 

 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

In
March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133" ("FAS 161") which provides revised guidance for enhanced
disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and
the related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. To the
extent the required information was not previously disclosed in the 2008 annual consolidated financial statements, new disclosures have been incorporated in note 10. 



 4.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  



FAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy under FAS 157 are: 



Level 1 — Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2 — Quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability; 

Level 3 — Prices
or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by
little or no market activity).

(1)Fair
value approximates the carrying amounts due to the short-term nature.
(2)Recorded
at fair value using quoted market prices.
(3)Recorded
at cost. This line item also includes accrued interest.
(4)Recorded
at fair value based on broker-dealer quotations. 



Both
the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are held to maturity and valued using interest
rates observable at commonly quoted intervals. Cash equivalents are market securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. 



 5.     CAPITAL STOCK  



During
the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company implemented a restricted share unit ("RSU") plan for certain employees. A deferred compensation balance was recorded for the total
grant-date value on the date of the grant. The deferred compensation balance was recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity and is being amortized as compensation expense
(or capitalized to construction in progress) over the applicable vesting period. 

The
Company funded the plan by transferring $3.0 million to an employee benefit trust ("Trust") that then purchased shares of the Company in the open market. For accounting purposes, the Trust
is treated as a variable interest entity and consolidated in the accounts of the Company. On consolidation, the dividends paid on the shares held by the Trust were eliminated. The shares purchased and
held by the Trust are treated as not being outstanding for the basic earnings per share ("EPS") calculations. They are amortized back into basic EPS over the vesting period. All of the shares held by
the Trust were included in the diluted EPS calculations. 

For
the first quarter of 2009, the Company's warrants were dilutive and were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. There were no outstanding warrants in the first quarter
of 2008. 

The
following table presents the maximum number of common shares that would be outstanding if all instruments outstanding at March 31, 2009 were exercised:

 10.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  



From
time to time, Agnico-Eagle has entered into financial instruments with a number of financial institutions in order to hedge underlying cash flow and fair value exposures arising from changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices or foreign currency exchange rates. 

In
2008 and 2009, financial instruments which have subjected Agnico-Eagle to market risk and concentration of credit risk consisted primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. Agnico-Eagle places its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in high quality securities issued by government agencies, financial institutions and major
corporations and limits the amount of credit exposure by diversifying its holdings. 

Agnico-Eagle
generates almost all of its revenues in US dollars. The Company's Canadian operations, which include the LaRonde Mine, the Goldex Mine and the Lapa and Meadowbank mine projects, have
Canadian dollar requirements for capital, operating and exploration expenditures. 

In
the third quarter of 2008, to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates, the Company entered into three zero cost collars to hedge the functional currency equivalent
cash flows associated with the Canadian dollar denominated capital expenditures. In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company entered into another zero cost collar for
the same purposes. The purchase of US dollar put options has been financed through selling US dollar call options at a higher level such that the net premium payable to the different counterparties by
the Company is nil. The hedged items represents monthly forecasted Canadian dollar cash outflows during 2009. At March 31, 2009, the zero cost collars hedge $175.0 million of 2009
expenditures (2008 —

nil).
The cash flow hedging relationship meets all requirements per SFAS 133 to be effective, and unrealized gains and losses are recognized within other comprehensive income ("OCI"). 

Gains
and losses deferred in accumulated OCI are reclassified into income when amortization (or depreciation) of the hedged capital asset begins. In other words, gains and losses in accumulated
OCI are reclassified into income in the same period or periods the asset affects income. Amounts transferred out of accumulated OCI are recorded in depreciation expense. The total amount of unrealized
loss on the hedges was $9.0 million as at March 31, 2009. No amounts were reclassified into income during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and none are expected to be
reclassified into earnings in 2009. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company reclassified a realized loss of $2.7 million from accumulated OCI to Meadowbank project
development costs (2008 — nil). 

The
following table shows the changes in the accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") balances recorded in the consolidated financial statements pertaining to the foreign exchange hedging
activities. The fair values of recorded derivative related assets and liabilities and their corresponding entries to accumulated other comprehensive income reflect the netting of the fair values of
individual derivative financial instruments.

As
at December 31, 2008, the Company had two unmatured covered call options on available-for-sale securities with a premium including a
mark-to-market valuation, amounting to $3.9 million. Premiums received on the sale of covered call options are recorded as a liability until they mature or the position
is closed. The Company sold these call options against the shares of Goldcorp Inc. ("Goldcorp") to reduce its price exposure to the Goldcorp shares it acquired in connection with Goldcorp's
acquisition of Gold Eagle. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company closed the two covered call option positions at a cost of $0.3 million and recognized a net
gain of $3.6 million in the interest and sundry income component of the consolidated statements of income (2008 — nil). 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company entered into three covered call options against the shares of Goldcorp that were unmatured at period end with a premium including
mark-to-market valuation, amounting to $4.1 million (2008 — nil). The total amount of $4.1 million will be recognized
through the consolidated statements of income in the second quarter of 2009. 


There
were no metal derivative positions in the first quarter of 2009 and none throughout 2008. 

The
fair values of Agnico-Eagle's current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying values as at March 31, 2009. 



 11.   COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND GUARANTEES  



As
part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company has been required to provide assurance in the form of letters of credit for environmental and site restoration costs, custom credits,
government grants and other general corporate purposes. As at March 31, 2009, the total amount of these guarantees was $55.4 million. 

Certain
of the Company's properties are subject to royalty arrangements. The following are the most significant royalties. 

The
Company has a royalty agreement with the Finnish government relating to the Kittila Mine. Starting 12 months after the mining operations commence, the Company has to pay 2% on net smelter
return, defined as revenue less processing costs. The royalty is paid on a yearly basis the following year. 

The
Company is committed to pay a royalty on future production from the Meadowbank mine project. The Nunavut Tunngavikadministered mineral claims are subject to production leases including a 12% net
profits interest royalty from which annual deductions are limited to 85% of gross revenue. Production from Crown mining leases is subject to a royalty of up to 14% of adjusted net profits, as defined
in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations under the Territorial Lands Act (Canada).
