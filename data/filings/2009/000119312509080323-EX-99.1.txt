Press Release dated April 15, 2009

 


 Exhibit 99.1  

   
 Acergy S.A. Announces First Quarter Results  London, England – April 15, 2009 – Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock Exchange: ACY), announced today results for the first quarter which
ended on February 28, 2009.  Highlights   


•
 
 Revenue from continuing operations was $503 million (Q1 2008: $610 million) due to anticipated lower comparative activity levels in Acergy Africa &
Mediterranean.   


 •
 
 Strong operating performance delivered an Adjusted EBITDA(a)
 margin from continuing operations of 20.2% (Q1 2008: 18.4%).   


•
 
 Strong balance sheet and cash position; $73 million net proceeds received following the completion of the sale of Acergy Piper. 
 


•
 
 Progress on new major contracts:   


 
•
 
 $250 million Angola LNG contract   


 
•
 
 SapuraAcergy joint venture awarded $825 million Gumusut-Kakap contract in Malaysia, post quarter-end.  Jean Cahuzac, Chief Executive Officer, said:  “In the first
quarter, we have delivered another solid performance in challenging conditions, translating operational execution into sound margins and profits.  Despite
caution about the short-term oil price, International and National Oil Companies have sought to maintain activity levels across major developments and to postpone, rather than cancel, less strategic and more marginal activities. With the industry
aggressively focused on cost, we are working with clients to conserve their cash wherever key variables, such as project scope, risk profile and procurement levels, can be revised. Encouragingly, suppliers have started to grasp this imperative and
are reducing prices of plant, equipment and sub-contractor services.  Market visibility in 2009 will be poor and we are managing our internal costs
appropriately. At this point in the industry cycle we remain focused on delivering outstanding execution for clients, while also being ready to strengthen and geographically re-orient our business for the upturn in the market when the global economy
emerges from recession.”  Financial Summary

 Operating Review  Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter fell to $228.0 million (Q1 2008: $359.5 million) due to lower activity levels and the planned dry-dock of the Acergy
Polaris. Good progress was made on Block 15, Tombua Landana and EPC2B, which completed during the quarter, and PazFlor, which passed the 5% profit recognition threshold during the quarter. Net operating income from continuing operations for the
quarter was $37.0 million (Q1 2008: $57.5 million) due to lower activity levels and utilisation of assets.  Acergy Northern Europe and Canada
– Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $138.1 million (Q1 2008: $128.0 million) reflecting good levels of SURF, IMR and survey activity. Good operational progress was made on StatoilHydro Alve, Dong Nini, Deep
Panuke and Tyrihans Subsea Installation. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.5 million (Q1 2008: $5.9 million), reflecting the $6.5 million charge for the cancellation of the Merlin charter and lower asset
utilisation during the quarter, offset by good project performance in a seasonally low period.  Acergy North America and Mexico
– Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $4.3 million (Q1 2008: $0.6 million) with net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter of $4.6 million (Q1 2008: $0.7 million) an improvement due
to the contribution from the cross-regional Frade Project which progressed well and good progress on the engineering phase of the Perdido Project.  Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $85.3 million (Q1 2008: $76.6 million) driven by strong revenue contribution from the Frade Project. The three ships on long-term service
agreements to Petrobras achieved high utilisation. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $7.5 million (Q1 2008: $7.5 million) following good performance on all activities.  Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $47.1 million (Q1 2008: $44.1 million) reflecting good
progress on projects, including Van Gogh and Pluto, which passed the 5% profit recognition threshold. Net operating income from continuing operations of $12.6 million (Q1 2008: net operating loss of $2.7 million) reflected good project performance,
including project close-out on Dai Hung.  Discontinued operations  Net income from discontinued operations for the first quarter was $1.9 million (Q1 2008: net loss of $7.3 million) due to the positive contribution from the Mexilhao Trunkline Project.  Asset Development  In January 2009, the Acergy Piper was sold
for net proceeds of $73 million. The Acergy Polaris completed her planned dry-dock programme and recommenced work in West Africa in the second half of the quarter.  The charter arrangement for the Merlin was cancelled in February. All charges, including a $6.5 million settlement relating to the cancellation of the charter, have been recognised in Acergy Northern Europe and
Canada during the first quarter.  Financial Review  Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 was $503 million (Q1 2008: $610 million) reflecting lower activity levels in West Africa and the planned dry-dock of the Acergy Polaris which were partially offset by
good SURF and IMR activity levels in the North Sea and good SURF activity levels in Brazil and Asia Pacific.  Gross profit was $115 million (Q1 2008: $136
million) reflecting the lower activity levels and fewer projects in installation phase in AFMED, which were partially offset by good project execution and some foreign exchange gains on trade balances during the quarter.  Administrative expenses were $53 million (Q1 2008: $60 million) reflecting a strengthened US dollar, partially offset by higher tendering costs.  Acergy’s share of results from associates and joint ventures was broadly flat at $10 million (Q1 2008: $11 million) reflecting a lower contribution from NKT
Flexibles, partially offset by a good contribution from Seaway Heavy Lifting and an improvement from the SapuraAcergy joint venture, which delivered a small positive contribution in the quarter.

 The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the three months was 20.2% (Q1 2008: 18.4%). The Adjusted
EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 20.0% (Q1 2008: 16.0%).  Income before taxes from continuing operations for the first quarter
was $62 million (Q1 2008: $82 million) reflecting the lower activity levels in AFMED, which were partially offset by good project execution and a good contribution from associates and joint ventures.  Taxation for the quarter was $22 million (Q1 2008: $33 million), reflecting an effective rate of 36% (Q1 2008: 41%).  Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $39 million (Q1 2008: $48 million). Net income from total operations for the first quarter was $41
million (Q1 2008: $41 million).  The cash and cash equivalents position at the quarter end was $678 million (Q4 2008: $573 million). Deferred revenue, at
the quarter end stood at $272 million (Q4 2008: $306 million).  At quarter end, Acergy S.A. held directly 11,224,508 treasury shares representing 5.76% of
the total number of issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares. Total shares in issue were 194,953,972, including these treasury shares.  Backlog  Backlog for continuing operations as at February 28,
2009 was approximately $2.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion is expected to be executed in the remainder of fiscal year 2009. This backlog figure does not include the backlog relating to associates and joint ventures.

 Current Trading and Outlook  Since the beginning of 2009, market conditions have become more challenging, characterised by sporadic order flow and pricing pressure on new contracts. Reduced market visibility and the late award of contracts make
us more cautious in respect of our expectations.  For fiscal year 2009, we expect revenue to decrease to levels marginally lower than current consensus.
However, our Adjusted EBITDA margin will show some resilience as we deliver on the current order book. Activity patterns in several regions will disrupt the typical annual profile of quarterly revenues and profits and the third quarter may be weaker
in comparison to the corresponding period in 2008.  Looking ahead, we are confident that our skills and strengths meet our clients’ strategic needs,
particularly in the development of hydrocarbon discoveries secured in frontier acreage. As demand improves, and with field depletion increasing, the need to access new reserves and replenish production will return our markets to growth. We are
well-placed, both financially and operationally, to exploit new growth areas, such as Brazil, while recognising that other regions have an evolving significance for the Group.  ************************************************************************************************************  Acergy S.A. is a seabed-to-surface engineering and construction contractor to the offshore oil and gas industry worldwide. We provide integrated services, and we plan, design and deliver complex projects in harsh and challenging
environments.  ************************************************************************************************************

 (a)
 Adjusted EBITDA:
The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus
finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as endorsed for use in the European Union. These non-IFRS
measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as they eliminate the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our
performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the Group may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as
presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful
than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity. The reconciliation of
the Group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this release. This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net
operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and equipment. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also
useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted
EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.  Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the
approximate value of the awarded contracts, the strength and geographical orientation of our business, our projections of 2009, expectations regarding our backlog and pre-backlog and statements contained in the “Current Trading and
Outlook” section, including our expected revenues and Adjusted EBITDA margin in fiscal 2009, the impact of activity patterns in several territories on our annual profile of quarterly revenues, our ability to exploit new growth areas, such as
Brazil, and statements as to management’s confidence that our market will return to growth and we are well suited to our clients’ strategic needs. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are subject to
risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ
materially from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the
outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of laws and
regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

 For the three months ended February 2009 and 2008 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible note would be to increase the diluted EPS from $0.20 to $0.22 (Q1 2008:
$0.20 to $0.21). This is anti-dilutive and is therefore not included in the calculation.
