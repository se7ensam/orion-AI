                           SapuraAcergy Joint Venture

London, England - October 2, 2009 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock
Exchange: ACY) announced the award of a contract valued at approximately $170
million to SapuraAcergy Sdn Bhd by Apache Energy Limited for the Devil Creek
Development Project (DCDP) offshore Australia.

The DCDP has been initiated to recover and process the gas reserves from the
Reindeer Gas Field located 80km northwest of the port of Dampier in 60m water
depth.

SapuraAcergy's scope under the contract involves the transportation and
installation of approximately 91km of 16" rigid pipeline including a shallow
water beach approach, subsea tie-in and stabilisation works together with a
wellhead platform of a 1,700T four leg jacket and a 450T topside processing
module.

Engineering and project preparations will commence immediately in Kuala Lumpur
and Perth. Offshore installation is scheduled to commence in late 2010 using the
Sapura 3000, SapuraAcergy's state of the art dynamic positioning heavy lift and
pipelay vessel and project specific third party support vessels.

This project will be accounted for in the share of results of associates and
joint ventures line in the Acergy accounts. For this reason, the value of this
award will not appear in Acergy's reported backlog and revenue.

Jean Cahuzac, Chief Executive Officer, Acergy said "This award represents an
important development for our Joint Venture and signifies Sapura 3000's entry
into the promising Australian market. It demonstrates our capability and
versatility by offering competitive solutions for both shallow and deepwater
projects. Building upon recent successes we are confident that our Joint Venture
and the highly specialised Sapura 3000 will perform strongly for our Client."
