Attached herewith as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release, dated August 4, 2009,
whereby Acergy S.A. (the "Company") advises that at the Extraordinary General
Meeting of Shareholders on August 4, 2009, resolution 9 (extending the validity
of the Company's authorized share capital and acknowledging the report of the
Board recommending and authorizing the issuance of Common Shares and the
suppression of shareholders' pre-emptive rights in connection therewith) and
resolution 10 (authorizing the Board to cancel shares which have been or may be
repurchased by the Company) were approved by shareholders.

The Board expects to call an Extraordinary General Meeting later in the year to
consider a proposal for updated Articles of Incorporation and a new Long-Term
Incentive Plan. In addition, the Board expects to propose additional directors.

The Board's Governance and Nomination Committee process of identifying and
communicating with potential additional directors is progressing well.

The information set forth above shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference
into the prospectuses forming a part of our Registration Statements on Form S-8
(No. 33-85168, No. 333-9292, No. 333-74321, No. 333-124983 and No. 333-124997)
and our Registration Statements on Form F-3 and Form F-3/A (No. 333-86288) and
to be a part of such prospectuses from the date of the filing thereof. The
attached press release, including the minutes of the Extraordinary General
Meeting, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that
section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under
the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific
reference in such filing.

Certain statements set forth above and contained in the press release furnished
pursuant to this Form 6-K may include "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use
of words like "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may,"
"plan," "project," "will," "should," "seek," and similar expressions. These
statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the expected timing
and proposed agenda items for a further extraordinary general meeting and the
status of the process of identifying and communicating with potential additional
directors. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and
assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors,
and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual
