on their business as now being conducted.  Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign entity to do business and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except to
the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  As used in
this Agreement, "Material
Adverse Effect" means any material adverse effect on the business,
properties, assets, operations, results of operations, condition (financial or
otherwise) or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, individually or
taken as a whole, or on the transactions contemplated hereby or on the other
Transaction Documents or by the agreements and instruments to be entered into in
connection herewith or therewith, or on the authority or ability of the Company
to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents.  The
Company has no Subsidiaries except as set forth on Schedule
3(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entities in which the
Company, directly or indirectly, owns any of the capital shares or holds an
equity or similar interest which are not Subsidiaries, taken as whole, do not
have operations, income or assets which are material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters.

and (iii) has set aside on its books provision reasonably adequate for the

(including all attachments, the "6-K Filing").  From
and after the filing of the 6-K Filing with the SEC, no Buyer shall be in
possession of any material, nonpublic information received from the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents, that is not disclosed in the 6-K Filing.  The Company shall
not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents, not to, provide any Buyer
with any material, nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from and after the filing of the 6-K Filing with the SEC without
the prior express written consent of such Buyer.  If a Buyer has, or
believes it has, received any such material, nonpublic information regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the Company or a "person" acting on
behalf of the Company" within the meaning of Rule 101(c) of Regulation FD in
breach of the immediately preceding sentence (and not including any such
information made available to such Buyer in connection with a Subsequent
Placement after such Buyer requested an Offer Notice pursuant to the procedure
set forth in Section 4(o)(iii)(1)), it may provide the Company with written
notice thereof.  If the Company and its counsel agree that such
information is material, nonpublic information, the Company shall, within two
(2) Trading Days (as defined in the Notes) of receipt of such notice, make
public disclosure of such material, nonpublic information (the "MNPI
Disclosure").  In the event the Company fails to make the MNPI
Disclosure, in addition to any other remedy provided herein or in the
Transaction Documents, a Buyer shall have the right to make a public disclosure,
in the form of a press release, public advertisement or otherwise, of such
material, nonpublic information without the prior approval by the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents.  No Buyer shall have any liability to the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders or agents for any such disclosure.  Subject to the
foregoing, neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Buyer shall issue any
press releases or any other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled,
without the prior approval of any Buyer, to make any press release or other
public disclosure with respect to such transactions (i) in substantial
conformity with the 6-K Filing and contemporaneously therewith and (ii) as is
required by applicable law and regulations (provided that in the case of clause
(i) each Buyer shall be consulted by the Company in connection with any such
press release or other public disclosure prior to its
release).  Without the prior written consent of any applicable Buyer,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall disclose the
name of such Buyer in any filing (other than in the exhibits to the 6-K Filing),
announcement, release or otherwise, except as otherwise required by any law,
rule or regulation applicable to the Company after consultation with such
Buyer.

    (j)            Restriction on Redemption
and Cash Dividends.  So long as any Notes are outstanding, the
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, redeem, or declare or pay any cash
dividend or distribution on, the Common Shares without the prior express written
consent of the Required Holders (as defined in the Notes).
     
    (k)           Additional Notes; Variable
Securities; Dilutive Issuances.  So long as any Buyer
beneficially owns any Securities, the Company will not issue any Notes other
than to the Buyers as contemplated hereby and the Company shall not issue any
other securities that would cause a breach or default under the
Notes.  For so long as any Notes or Warrants remain outstanding, the
Company shall not, in any manner, issue or sell any rights, warrants or options
to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or directly or indirectly convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Shares at a price which varies or
may vary with the market price of the Common Shares, including by way of one or
more reset(s) to any fixed price unless the conversion, exchange or exercise
price of any such security cannot be less than the then applicable Conversion
Price (as defined in the Notes) with respect to the Common Shares into which any
Note is convertible or the then applicable Exercise Price (as defined in the
Warrants) with respect to the Common Shares into which any Warrant is
exercisable.  For so long as any Notes or Warrants remain outstanding,
the Company shall not, in any manner, enter into or affect any Dilutive Issuance
(as defined in the Notes) if the effect of such Dilutive Issuance is to cause
the Company to be required to issue upon conversion of any Note or exercise of
any Warrant any Common Shares in excess of that number of Common Shares which
the Company may issue upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants
without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of
the Principal Market or any applicable Eligible Market (as defined in the
Registration Rights Agreement).

    (l)            Corporate
Existence.  So long as any Buyer beneficially owns any
Securities, the Company shall maintain its corporate existence and shall not be
party to any Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Notes) unless the
Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing Fundamental
Transactions set forth in the Notes and the Warrants.
     
    (m)          Reservation of
Shares.  So long as any Buyer owns any Securities, the Company
shall take all action necessary to at all times after the Shareholder Approval
(as defined below) have authorized, and reserved and maintained for the purpose
of issuance, no less than 130% of the sum of the number of Common Shares
issuable (A) upon conversion of the Notes, (B) upon exercise of the Warrants
then outstanding (without taking into account any limitations on the conversion
of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants set forth in the Notes and Warrants,
respectively) and (C) as Interest Shares pursuant to the terms of the
Notes.  If at any time the number of Common Shares authorized and
reserved and maintained for issuance is not sufficient to meet the Required
Reserved Amount, the Company will promptly take all corporate action necessary
to authorize and reserve and maintain for issuance a sufficient number of
shares, including, without limitation, calling a special meeting of shareholders
to authorize additional shares to meet the Company's obligations under Section
3(c), in the case of an insufficient number of authorized shares, obtain
shareholder approval of an increase in such authorized number of shares of the
Company in favor of an increase in the authorized shares of the Company to
ensure that the number of authorized shares is sufficient to meet the Required
Reserved Amount.
     
    (n)           Conduct of
Business.  The business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any
governmental entity, except where such violations would not result, either
individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.
     
    (o)           Additional Issuances of
Securities.

    (ii)                   From
the date hereof until thirty (30) days after the date when all Registrable
Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) have been
registered (the "Trigger
Date"), the Company will not, directly or indirectly, file any
registration statement with the SEC other than the Registration Statement (as
defined in the Registration Rights Agreement).  From the date hereof
until the Trigger Date, the Company will not, (A) directly or indirectly, offer,
sell, grant any option to purchase, or otherwise dispose of (or announce any
offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition of) any of its
or its Subsidiaries' equity or equity equivalent securities, including without
limitation any debt, preferred stock or other instrument or security that is, at
any time during its life and under any circumstances, convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Common Shares or Common Shares Equivalents (any
such offer, sale, grant, disposition or announcement being referred to as a
"Subsequent Placement")
or (B) be party to any solicitations, negotiations or discussions with regard to
the foregoing.
     
    (iii)                  From
the Trigger Date until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company
will not, directly or indirectly, effect any Subsequent Placement unless the
Company shall have first complied with this Section 4(o)(iii).
     
    (1)           The
Company shall deliver to each Buyer a written notice stating that the Company
may have information to share with such Buyer and requesting the Buyer to inform
the Company if it is willing to receive a notice of such
information.  If such Buyer indicates its willingness to receive such
information, then the Company shall deliver promptly, but in any event no later
than one (1) Business Day after being informed by such Buyer of its willingness
to receive the information, a written notice (the "Offer Notice") of any proposed
or intended issuance or sale or exchange (the "Offer") of the securities
being offered (the "Offered
Securities") in a Subsequent Placement, which Offer Notice shall (w)
identify and describe the Offered Securities, (x) describe the price and
other terms upon which they are to be issued, sold or exchanged, and the number
or amount of the Offered Securities to be issued, sold or exchanged,
(y) identify the persons or entities (if known) to which or with which the
Offered Securities are to be offered, issued, sold or exchanged and (z) offer to
issue and sell to or exchange with such Buyers fifty percent (50%) of the
Offered Securities, allocated among such Buyers (a) based on such Buyer's pro
rata portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes purchased hereunder (the
"Basic Amount"), and (b)
with respect to each Buyer that elects to purchase its Basic Amount, any
additional portion of the Offered Securities attributable to the Basic Amounts
of other Buyers as such Buyer shall indicate it will purchase or acquire should
the other Buyers subscribe for less than their Basic Amounts (the "Undersubscription Amount"),
which process shall be repeated no more than one time so that the Buyers shall
have an opportunity to subscribe for any remaining Undersubscription
Amount.

    (2)           To
accept an Offer, in whole or in part, such Buyer must deliver a written notice
to the Company prior to the end of the ninth (9th)
Business Day after such Buyer's receipt of the Offer Notice (the "Offer Period"), setting forth
the portion of such Buyer's Basic Amount that such Buyer elects to purchase and,
if such Buyer shall elect to purchase all of its Basic Amount, the
Undersubscription Amount, if any, that such Buyer elects to purchase (in either
case, the "Notice of
Acceptance").  If the Basic Amounts subscribed for by all
Buyers are less than the total of all of the Basic Amounts, then each Buyer who
has set forth an Undersubscription Amount in its Notice of Acceptance shall be
entitled to purchase, in addition to the Basic Amounts subscribed for, the
Undersubscription Amount it has subscribed for; provided, however, that if the
Undersubscription Amounts subscribed for exceed the difference between the total
of all the Basic Amounts and the Basic Amounts subscribed for (the "Available Undersubscription
Amount"), each Buyer who has subscribed for any Undersubscription Amount
shall be entitled to purchase only that portion of the Available
Undersubscription Amount as the Basic Amount of such Buyer bears to the total
Basic Amounts of all Buyers that have subscribed for Undersubscription Amounts,
subject to rounding by the Company to the extent its deems reasonably
necessary.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, if the Company desires to modify or amend the
terms and conditions of the Offer prior to the expiration of the Offer Period,
the Company may deliver to the Buyers a new Offer Notice and the Offer Period
shall expire on the tenth (10th) Business Day after such Buyer's receipt of such
new Offer Notice.
     
    (3)           The
Company shall have seven (7) Business Days from the expiration of the Offer
Period above to offer, issue, sell or exchange all or any part of such Offered
Securities as to which a Notice of Acceptance has not been given by the Buyers
(the "Refused
Securities") pursuant to a definitive agreement (the "Subsequent Placement
Agreement") but only to the offerees described in the Offer Notice (if so
described therein) and only upon terms and conditions (including, without
limitation, unit prices and interest rates) that are not more favorable to the
acquiring person or persons or less favorable to the Company than those set
forth in the Offer Notice and (ii) to publicly announce (a) the execution of
such Subsequent Placement Agreement, and (b) either (x) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such Subsequent Placement Agreement or (y) the
termination of such Subsequent Placement Agreement, which shall be filed with
the SEC on a Current Report on Form 6-K with such Subsequent Placement Agreement
and any documents contemplated therein filed as exhibits thereto.
     
    (4)           In
the event the Company shall propose to sell less than all the Refused Securities
(any such sale to be in the manner and on the terms specified in Section
4(o)(iii)(3) above), then each Buyer may, at its sole option and in its sole
discretion, reduce the number or amount of the Offered Securities specified in
its Notice of Acceptance to an amount that shall be not less than the number or
amount of the Offered Securities that such Buyer elected to purchase pursuant to
Section 4(o)(iii)(2) above multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which
shall be the number or amount of Offered Securities the Company actually
proposes to issue, sell or exchange (including Offered Securities to be issued
or sold to Buyers pursuant to Section 4(o)(iii)(3) above prior to such
reduction) and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the original amount of the
Offered Securities.  In the event that any Buyer so elects to reduce
the number or amount of Offered Securities specified in its Notice of
Acceptance, the Company may not issue, sell or exchange more than the reduced
number or amount of the Offered Securities unless and until such securities have
again been offered to the Buyers in accordance with Section 4(o)(iii)(1)
above.

    (5)           Upon
the closing of the issuance, sale or exchange of all or less than all of the
Refused Securities, the Buyers shall acquire from the Company, and the Company
shall issue to the Buyers, the number or amount of Offered Securities specified
in the Notices of Acceptance, as reduced pursuant to Section 4(o)(iii)(3) above
if the Buyers have so elected, upon the terms and conditions specified in the
Offer.  The purchase by the Buyers of any Offered Securities is
subject in all cases to the preparation, execution and delivery by the Company
and the Buyers of a purchase agreement relating to such Offered Securities
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Buyers and their respective
counsel. The Buyers and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts
to consummate such offering as promptly as commercially
practicable.
     
    (6)           Any
Offered Securities not acquired by the Buyers or other persons in accordance
with Section 4(o)(iii)(3) above may not be issued, sold or exchanged until they
are again offered to the Buyers under the procedures specified in this
Agreement.
     
    (7)           The
Company and the Buyers agree that if any Buyer elects to participate in the
Offer, (x) neither the Subsequent Placement Agreement with respect to such Offer
nor any other transaction documents related thereto (collectively, the "Subsequent Placement
Documents") shall include any term or provisions whereby any Buyer shall
be required to agree to any restrictions in trading as to any securities of the
Company owned by such Buyer prior to such Subsequent Placement, and (y) any
registration rights set forth in such Subsequent Placement Documents shall be
similar in all material respects to the registration rights contained in the
Registration Rights Agreement.
     
    (8)           Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4(o) and unless otherwise agreed to by
the Buyers, the Company shall either confirm in writing to the Buyers that the
transaction with respect to the Subsequent Placement has been abandoned or shall
publicly disclose its intention to issue the Offered Securities, in either case
in such a manner such that the Buyers will not be in possession of material
non-public information, by the sixteenth (16th)
Business Day following delivery of the Offer Notice.  If by the
sixteenth (16th)
Business Day following delivery of the Offer Notice no public disclosure
regarding a transaction with respect to the Offered Securities has been made,
and no notice regarding the abandonment of such transaction has been received by
the Buyers, such transaction shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the
Buyers shall not be deemed to be in possession of any material, non-public
information with respect to the Company.  Should the Company decide to
pursue such transaction with respect to the Offered Securities, the Company
shall provide each Buyer with another Offer Notice and each Buyer will again
have the right of participation set forth in this Section
4(o)(iii).  The Company shall not be permitted to deliver more than
one such Offer Notice to the Buyers in any 60 day period.

restrictions contained in subsections (ii) and (iii) of this Section 4(o) shall
not apply (x) in connection with the issuance of any Excluded Securities (as
defined in the Notes) and (y) pursuant to a bona fide firm commitment
underwritten public offering with a nationally recognized underwriter which
generates gross proceeds to the Company in excess of the greater of (i)
$25,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding
other than any Notes beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by Mr. Lu (or
any of his family members, affiliates or agents), the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. (other than an "at-the-market offering" as defined in Rule
415(a)(4) under the 1933 Act or equity lines).
     
    (p)          
Trading in Common
Shares.
     
    (i)           For
so long as such Buyer owns any Notes, such Buyer shall not maintain a Net Short
Position.  For purposes hereof, a "Net Short Position" by a
Person means a position whereby such Person has executed one or more sales of
Common Shares that is marked as a short sale and that is executed at a time when
such Buyer has no equivalent offsetting long position in the Common Shares or
contract for the foregoing.  For purposes of determining whether a
Buyer has an equivalent offsetting long position in the Common Shares, all
Common Shares (A) that are owned by such Buyer, (B) that may be issued as
Interest Shares pursuant to the terms of the Notes to the Buyer, (C) that would
be issuable upon conversion or exercise in full of all Securities then held by
such Buyer (assuming that such Securities were then fully convertible or
exercisable, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, and giving effect
to any conversion or exercise price adjustments that would take effect given
only the passage of time) or (D) that could be issuable pursuant to the Put
Agreements (assuming no restriction on issuance, notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary) shall be deemed to be held long by such Buyer.
     
    (ii)           During
the period commencing twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the
Adjustment Date (as defined in the Notes) and ending with the close of trading
on the Principal Market on the Adjustment Date (such period, the "Restricted Period"), each
Buyer, severally and not jointly with the other Buyers, covenants that neither
it nor any of its Buyer Trading Affiliates will engage in any sale of the Common
Shares, including "short sales" as defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO under
the 1934 Act.
     
    (iii)         Except
as set forth in the Put Agreements, during the Restricted Period, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, and no one acting on any of their behalf
(including, without limitation, any officer, director, employee, affiliate,
attorney or agent) shall purchase, directly or indirectly, any Common Shares or
any securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common
Shares.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, and no one acting on any of their behalf
(including, without limitation, any officer, director, employee, affiliate,
attorney or agent) shall, directly or indirectly, (A) take any action designed
to cause or to result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any
security of the Company, (B) sell, bid for, purchase, or pay any compensation
for soliciting any sale, bid for or purchase of any security of the Company,
including, without limitation, any Common Share, any of the Securities and any
short sales (as defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO under the 1934 Act)
related thereto (other than the offer, sale and issuance by the Company of
Excluded Securities to officers, directors and employees of the Company in the
ordinary course of business), (C) issue or offer any security of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than the offer, sale and issuance
by the Company of Excluded Securities to officers, directors and employees of
the Company in the ordinary course of business), (D) pay or agree to pay to any
Person any compensation for soliciting another to purchase or sell any
securities of the Company, or (E) enter into any agreement or other writing or
make any offer with respect to the foregoing actions.
     
    (q)           Public
Information.  At any time during the period commencing from the
six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Shareholder Approval
Deadline") and ending, if a registration statement is not available for
the resale of all of the Registrable Securities, at such time that all of the
Securities may be sold without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144
and without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1), if the
Company shall fail for any reason to satisfy the current public information
requirement under Rule 144(c) (a "Public Information Failure")
then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder of Securities by reason of
any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell the Securities (which
remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in
equity), the Company shall pay to each such holder an amount in cash equal to
two percent (2.0%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of such holder's Company
Securities on the day of a Public Information Failure and on every thirtieth day
(pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) thereafter until the
earlier of (i) the date such Public Information Failure is cured and (ii) such
time that such public information is no longer required pursuant to Rule
144.  The payments to which a holder shall be entitled pursuant to
this Section 4(q) are referred to herein as "Public Information Failure
Payments."  Public Information Failure Payments shall be paid
on the earlier of (I) the last day of the calendar month during which such
Public Information Failure Payments are incurred
and (II) the third Business Day after the event or failure giving rise to the
Public Information Failure Payments is
cured.  In the event the Company fails to make Public Information
Failure Payments in
a timely manner, such Public Information Failure Payments shall bear
interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (prorated for partial months) until paid
in full.
     
    (r)            Shareholder Approval.
The Company shall provide each shareholder entitled to vote at a special or
annual meeting of shareholders of the Company (the "Shareholder Meeting"), which
shall be called as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no
event later than August 24, 2009 (the "Shareholder Meeting
Deadline"), a proxy statement, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Buyers meeting the requirements of the laws of the British Virgin Islands after
review by Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP at the expense of the Company, not to
exceed $7,500, soliciting each such shareholder's affirmative vote at the
Shareholder Meeting for approval of resolutions (the "Resolutions") providing for
the issuance of all of the Securities as described in the Transaction Documents
in accordance with applicable law, the provisions of the Articles of Association
and the rules and regulations of the Principal Market (such affirmative approval
being referred to herein as the "Shareholder Approval" and the
date such approval is obtained, the "Shareholder Approval Date"),
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit its
shareholders' approval of such Resolutions and to cause the Board of Directors
of the Company to recommend to the shareholders that they approve the
Resolutions.  The Company shall be obligated to seek to obtain the
Shareholder Approval by the Shareholder Meeting Deadline.  If, despite
the Company's reasonable best efforts, the Shareholder Approval is not obtained
at the Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall cause an additional Shareholder
Meeting to be held each calendar quarter thereafter until Shareholder Approval
is obtained, unless all of the Notes and the Warrants have been put to Mr. Lu
pursuant to the Put Agreements for the Lu Conversion Shares and the Lu Warrant
Shares, respectively.

    (s)           Voting
Agreement.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Voting Agreement,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Voting Agreement"), executed
by the Company, Mr. Lu and Mr. John S. Lin ("Mr. Lin" and, collectively
with Mr. Lu, the "Principal
Shareholders").  The Company shall not amend or waive any
provision of the Voting Agreement and shall enforce the provisions of the Voting
Agreement in accordance with its terms. If the Principal Shareholders breach any
provisions of the Voting Agreement, the Company shall promptly use its
reasonable best efforts to seek specific performance of the terms of the Voting
Agreement in accordance with Section 4.02 thereof.  In addition, if
the Company receives any notice from the Principal Shareholders pursuant to the
Voting Agreement, the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days, deliver a copy of such notice to each Buyer.
     
    (t)            Lock-Up.  The
Company shall not amend or waive any provision of any of the Lock-Up Agreements
except to extend the term of the lock-up period.
     
    (u)           Buyers' Voting
Agreement.  While any Buyer holds any Common Shares, each such
Buyer hereby agrees to cast an affirmative vote at any shareholder meeting with
respect to resolutions providing for (i) Shareholder Approval, (ii) the
amendment of the Company's Articles of Association to remove the requirement for
shareholder approval for Common Shares issuances and repurchases pursuant to
Sections 3 and 17 of the Articles of Association, respectively, and (iii) the
issuance to Mr. Lu of a number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to the Notes
and Warrants (on the terms set forth therein) delivered to Mr. Lu by one or more
Buyers pursuant to the Put Agreements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Buyers shall be under any obligation to hold any Common Shares for
any length of time.
     
    (v)           Multiple
Certificates.  From and after the Closing Date, if the
Collateral Agent delivers Common Share certificates and/or stock powers
representing the Pledged Shares to the Company with instructions to reissue
multiple certificates and stock powers in replacement of one or more
certificates and stock powers in larger denominations, the Company shall cause
its transfer agent to comply with such request promptly, but in no event later
than three (3) Trading Days after receipt of the Common Share certificates
representing the Pledged Shares; provided, that the
Company shall not be required to break down the Pledged Shares into more than
twenty (20) Common Share certificates and stock powers at any one

    (x) Collateral
Agent.
     
    (i)           Each
Buyer hereby (a) appoints the Collateral Agent, as the collateral agent under
the Put Agreements and under the Pledge Agreement, and (b) authorizes the
Collateral Agent (and its officers, directors, employees and agents) to take
such action on such Buyer's behalf in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof.  The Collateral Agent shall not have, by reason hereof or the
Pledge Agreement, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any
Buyer.  Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees and agents shall have any liability to any Buyer for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in connection hereof or the Pledge Agreement
except to the extent caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct,
and each Buyer agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the
Collateral Agent and all of its officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the "Collateral
Agent Indemnitees") from and against
any losses, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) incurred by such Collateral Agent
Indemnitee, whether direct, indirect or consequential, arising from or in
connection with the performance by such Collateral Agent Indemnitee of the
duties and obligations of Collateral Agent pursuant hereto or any of the
Security Documents.
     
    (ii)           The
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any written notices, statements,
certificates, orders or other documents or any telephone message believed by it
in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
the proper Person, and with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement
or any of the other Transaction Documents and its duties hereunder or
thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.
     
    (iii)           The
Collateral Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and duties
hereunder and under the Notes, the Warrants and the Pledge Agreement at any time
by giving at least ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to the Company
and each holder of the Notes.  Such resignation shall take effect upon
the acceptance by a successor Collateral Agent of appointment as provided
below.  Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Holders
shall appoint a successor Collateral Agent.  Upon the acceptance of
the appointment as Collateral Agent, such successor Collateral Agent shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Collateral Agent, and the retiring Collateral Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and
the Pledge Agreement.  After any Collateral Agent's resignation
hereunder, the provisions of this Section 4(x) shall inure to its benefit. If a
successor Collateral Agent shall not have been so appointed within said ten (10)
Business Day period, the retiring Collateral Agent shall then appoint a
successor Collateral Agent who shall serve until such time, if any, as the
Required Holders appoint a successor Collateral Agent as provided
above.
     
    (iv)           The
Collateral Agent hereby agrees to act, and the Company hereby agrees to take any
actions necessary to facilitate such necessary actions, in accordance with the
written instructions delivered to it by a Buyer, in substantially the form
attached as Schedule
I to Exhibit
I to the Put Agreements, including to deliver a share certificate (the
"Certificate")
representing a number of shares as requested by such Buyer (the "Exercise Notice Share Amount")
and a share power, duly executed by Mr. Lu with a medallion guarantee, each of
which is held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, to the
Company's Transfer Agent and to direct the Company's Transfer Agent, to (i)
issue the Exercise Notice Share Amount (as defined in the Put Agreements) of
such Common Shares in accordance with the Exercise Notice attached as Exhibit I to the Put
Agreements and (ii) if the number of Common Shares represented by the
Certificate exceeds the Exercise Notice Share Amount, deliver a certificate with
respect to such excess number of shares with an identical legend to any legend
set forth on the Certificate to the Collateral Agent.

    (y) Successor Collateral
Agent.  The Company hereby covenants and agrees to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to
secure a successor Collateral Agent satisfactory to the Buyers, in their sole
discretion (it being acknowledged and agreed by the Buyers that The Bank of New
York Mellon is a satisfactory successor Collateral Agent), as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, including, without limitation, by paying all fees of such successor
Collateral Agent, by having the Company agree to indemnify any successor
Collateral Agent and by each of the Company and Mr. Lu executing a collateral
agency agreement or similar agreement and/or any amendment to the Pledge
Agreement reasonably requested or required by the successor Collateral
Agent.
     
    (z) Closing

REGISTER; TRANSFER
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS.
     
    (a)           Register.  The
Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office
or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to each holder of
Securities), a register for the Notes and the Warrants in which the Company
shall record the name and address of the Person in whose name the Notes and the Warrants have been
issued (including the name and address of each transferee), the principal amount
of Notes held by such Person, the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon
conversion of the Notes and Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Warrants held by such Person.  The Company shall keep the register
open and available at all times during business hours for inspection of any
Buyer or its legal representatives.

    (b)          Transfer Agent
Instructions.  The Company shall issue irrevocable instructions
to its transfer agent, and any subsequent transfer agent, to issue certificates
or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at the DTC, registered in
the name of each Buyer or its respective nominee(s), for the Conversion Shares,
the Interest Shares and the Warrant Shares issued at the Closing or upon
conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants in such amounts as specified
in such amounts as specified from time to time by each Buyer to the Company upon
conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants in the form of Exhibit G (the "Irrevocable Transfer Agent
Instructions").  The Company warrants that no instruction other
than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section
5(b), and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(f) hereof, will
be given by the Company to its transfer agent, and that the Securities shall
otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and
to the extent provided in this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.  If a Buyer effects a sale, assignment or transfer of the
Securities in accordance with Section 2(f), the Company shall permit the
transfer and shall promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more
certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at DTC in such
name and in such denominations as specified by such Buyer to effect such sale,
transfer or assignment.  In the event that such sale, assignment or
transfer involves the Conversion Shares, the Interest Shares or the Warrant
Shares sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an effective registration
statement or pursuant to Rule 144, the transfer agent shall issue such
Securities to the Buyer, assignee or transferee, as the case may be, without any
restrictive legend.  The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of
its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to a
Buyer.  Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that the remedy at law
for a breach of its obligations under this Section 5(b) will be inadequate and
agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the
provisions of this Section 5(b), that a Buyer shall be entitled, in addition to
all other available remedies, to an order and/or injunction restraining any
breach and requiring immediate issuance and transfer, without the necessity of
showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being
required.

    9.            MISCELLANEOUS.
     
    (a)           Governing Law; Jurisdiction;
Jury Trial.  All questions concerning the construction,
validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by
the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdictions other than the State of New York.  Each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts sitting in The City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the
adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any
transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that
such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper.  Each party
hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process
being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to
such party at the address for such notices to it under this Agreement and agrees
that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and
notice thereof.  The Company hereby appoints C T Corporation System,
with offices at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its agent for
service of process in New York.  Nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by
law.  EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A
JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.
     
    (b)           Counterparts.  This
Agreement may be executed in two or more identical counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party. In
the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by an
e-mail which contains a portable document format (.pdf) file of an executed
signature page, such signature page shall be considered due execution and shall
be binding upon the signatory thereto with the same force and effect as if the
signature were an original.

    (c)           Headings.  The
headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference and shall not form
part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Agreement.
     
    (d)           Severability.  If
any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to
be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision
that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed
amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable,
and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement so long as this Agreement
as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original
intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited
nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not
substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of
the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be
conferred upon the parties.  The parties will endeavor in good faith
negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s)
with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to
that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s).
     
    (e)           Entire Agreement;
Amendments.  This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
supersede all other prior oral or written agreements between the Buyers, the
Company, their affiliates and Persons acting on their behalf with respect to the
matters discussed herein, and this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
and the instruments referenced herein and therein contain the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the matters covered herein and
therein and, except as specifically set forth herein or therein, neither the
Company nor any Buyer makes any representation, warranty, covenant or
undertaking with respect to such matters.  No provision of this
Agreement may be amended other than by an instrument in writing signed by the
Company and the Required Holders, and any amendment to this Agreement made in
conformity with the provisions of this Section 9(e) shall be binding on all
Buyers and holders of Securities, as applicable.  No provision hereof
may be waived other than by an instrument in writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought.  No such amendment shall be effective to
the extent that it applies to less than all of the holders of the applicable
Securities then outstanding.  No consideration shall be offered or
paid to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any
provision of any of the Transaction Documents unless the same consideration also
is offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents, holders of Notes
or holders of the Warrants, as the case may be.  The Company has not,
directly or indirectly, made any agreements with any Buyers relating to the
terms or conditions of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents except as set forth in the Transaction Documents.  Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company confirms that, except as set forth in this
Agreement, no Buyer has made any commitment or promise or has any other
obligation to provide any financing to the Company or otherwise.
     
    (f)            Notices.  Any
notices, consents, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be
given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to

such other address and/or facsimile number and/or to the attention of such other
Person as the recipient party has specified by written notice given to each
other party five (5) days prior to the effectiveness of such

    Any
document shall be deemed to have been duly served if marked for the attention of
the agent for service of process at its address (as set forth in Section 9(a))
or such other address in the United States as may be notified to the party
wishing to serve the document and delivered in accordance with the notice
provisions set forth in this Section 9(f).
    
    If the
Company's agent for service of process at any time ceases for any reason to act
as such, the Company shall appoint a replacement agent having an address for
service in the United States and shall notify each Buyer in writing of the name
and address of the replacement agent.  Failing such appointment and
notification, each Buyer shall be entitled by notice to the Company to appoint a
replacement agent to act on the Company's behalf.  The provisions of
this Section 9(f) applying to service on an agent for service of process apply
equally to service on a replacement agent.
     
    (g)           Successors and
Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, including
any purchasers of the Notes or the Warrants.  The Company shall not
assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Required Holders, including by way of a Fundamental
Transaction (unless the Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions
governing Fundamental Transactions set forth in the Notes and the
Warrants).  A Buyer may assign some or all of its rights hereunder
without the consent of the Company, in which event such assignee shall be deemed
to be a Buyer hereunder with respect to such assigned rights.
     
    (h)           No Third Party
Beneficiaries.  This Agreement is intended for the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and is
not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other
Person.
     
    (i)             Survival.  Unless
this Agreement is terminated under Section 8, the representations and warranties
of the Company and the Buyers contained in Sections 2 and 3, and the agreements
and covenants set forth in Sections 4, 5 and 9 shall survive the
Closing.  Each Buyer shall be responsible only for its own
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants hereunder.
     
    (j)             Further
Assurances.  Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be
done and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and
deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as
any other party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the

    (k)           Indemnification.  In
consideration of each Buyer's execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents and acquiring the Securities thereunder and in addition to all of the
Company's other obligations under the Transaction Documents, the Company shall
defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer and each other holder of
the Securities and all of their shareholders, partners, members, officers,
directors, employees and direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing
Persons' agents or other representatives (including, without limitation, those
retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against
any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, losses, costs, penalties,
fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in connection therewith
(irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to the action for which
indemnification hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements (the "Indemnified Liabilities"),
incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to (a)
any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in the Transaction Documents, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement
or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or (c) any
cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee by a
third party (including for these purposes a derivative action brought on behalf
of the Company) and arising out of or resulting from (i) the execution,
delivery, performance or enforcement of the Transaction Documents, (ii) any
transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, with the proceeds of the issuance of the Securities, (iii) any
disclosure made by such Buyer pursuant to Section 4(i), or (iv) the status of
such Buyer or holder of the Securities as an investor in the Company pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, provided, however,
that the Company's obligations under this Section 9(k) with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities referred to in the preceding clauses (a) through (c) and
incurred under the Registration Rights Agreement shall be limited to the
Indemnified Liabilities for which indemnity is expressly provided pursuant to
Section 6 of the Registration Rights Agreement.  To the extent that
the foregoing undertaking by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason,
the Company shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction
of each of the Indemnified Liabilities that is permissible under applicable
law.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, the mechanics and
procedures with respect to the rights and obligations under this Section 9(k)
shall be the same as those set forth in Section 6 of the Registration Rights
Agreement.
     
    (l)            No Strict
Construction.  The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent,
and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any
party.
     
    (m)          Remedies.  Each
Buyer and each holder of the Securities shall have all rights and remedies set
forth in the Transaction Documents and all rights and remedies which such
holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and
all of the rights which such holders have under any law.  Any Person
having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to
enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to
recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and
to exercise all other rights granted by law.  Furthermore, the Company
recognizes that in the event that it fails to perform, observe, or discharge any
or all of its obligations under the Transaction Documents, any remedy at law may
prove to be inadequate relief to the Buyers.  The Company therefore
agrees that the Buyers shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent
injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual
damages and without posting a bond or other security.
     
    (n)           Rescission and Withdrawal
Right.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
(and without limiting any similar provisions of) the Transaction Documents,
whenever any Buyer exercises a right, election, demand or option under a
Transaction Document and the Company does not timely perform its related
obligations within the periods therein provided, then such Buyer may rescind or
withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to the
Company, any relevant notice, demand or election in whole or in part without
prejudice to its future actions and rights.

    (o)           Payment Set
Aside.  To the extent that the Company makes a payment or
payments to the Buyers hereunder or pursuant to any of the other Transaction
Documents or the Buyers enforce or exercise their rights hereunder or
thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or
exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are
required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee,
receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any
bankruptcy law, foreign, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of
action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement
or setoff had not occurred.
     
    (p)           Independent Nature of
Buyers' Obligations and Rights.  The obligations of each Buyer
under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of
any other Buyer, and no Buyer shall be responsible in any way for the
performance of the obligations of any other Buyer under any Transaction
Document.  Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction
Document, and no action taken by any Buyer pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be
deemed to constitute the Buyers as, and the Company acknowledges that the Buyers
do not so constitute, a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Buyers are in any way
acting in concert or as a group, and the Company shall not assert any such claim
with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and the Company acknowledges that the Buyers are not
acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.  The Company
acknowledges and each Buyer confirms that it has independently participated in
the negotiation of the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its
own counsel and advisors.  Each Buyer shall be entitled to
independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the
rights arising out of this Agreement or out of any other Transaction Documents,
and it shall not be necessary for any other Buyer to be joined as an additional
party in any proceeding for such purpose.
     
    (q)                       Currency.  Unless
otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts referred to in this Agreement are in
United States Dollars.  All amounts owing under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document shall be paid in US dollars.  All amounts
denominated in other currencies shall be converted in the US dollar equivalent
amount in accordance with the Exchange Rate on the date of
calculation.  "Exchange Rate" means, in
relation to any amount of currency to be converted into US dollars pursuant to
this Agreement, the US dollar exchange rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal on the relevant date of calculation.
     
    (r)                        Judgment
Currency.
     
    (i)                        If
for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Company in any
court in any jurisdiction it becomes necessary to convert into any other
currency (such other currency being hereinafter in this Section 9(r) referred to
as the "Judgment
Currency") an amount due in US Dollars under this Agreement, the
conversion shall be made at the Exchange Rate prevailing on the Business Day
immediately preceding:

    (1)           the
date of actual payment of the amount due, in the case of any proceeding in the
courts of New York or in the courts of any other jurisdiction that will give
effect to such conversion being made on such date: or
     
    (2)           the
date on which the foreign court determines, in the case of any proceeding in the
courts of any other jurisdiction (the date as of which such conversion is made
pursuant to this Section being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Conversion
Date").
     
    (ii)                         If
in the case of any proceeding in the court of any jurisdiction referred to in
Section 9(r)(i)(2) above, there is a change in the Exchange Rate prevailing
between the Judgment Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the
amount due, the applicable party shall pay such adjusted amount as may be
necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the Exchange Rate prevailing on the date of payment, will produce
the amount of US Dollars which could have been purchased with the amount of
Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial order at the Exchange
Rate prevailing on the Judgment Conversion Date.
     
    (iii)                        Any
amount due from the Company under this provision shall be due as a separate debt
and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other amounts due
under or in respect of this Agreement.
