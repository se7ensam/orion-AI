	    Attention Business Editors:
	    Advantage Replaces 290% of Annual Production in 2008 at a FD&A cost of
	    $7.67 per Boe, Increases Reserves per Unit by 11% and Extends RLI to 15.2
	    years

	    (TSX: AVN.UN, NYSE: AAV)

	    CALGARY, March 5 /CNW/ - Advantage Energy Income Fund ("Advantage" or the
"Fund") is pleased to announce the Fund's corporate year end reserves as of
December 31, 2008. Year end financial and operating information will be
released on or about March 18, 2009.
	    Overall, the Fund replaced 290% of annual production with the vast
majority of reserve additions realized through our successful 2008 drilling
program at Glacier, Alberta where the Fund commenced a significant development
drilling program on our Montney natural gas resource play. Based on results to
date, Advantage estimates that a total capital investment in excess of $2.5
billion will be required to fully develop our extensive Montney land holdings
at Glacier.
	    In 2008, all-in Finding, Development and Acquisition ("FD&A") costs were
$7.67 per proven plus probable boe before changes in future development
capital ("FDC") and $16.70 per boe including changes in FDC.

	    <<
	    Highly Successful 2008 Drilling Program at Glacier & Key Properties leads
	    to Efficient Reserve Additions

	    -   Our 2008 drilling program resulted in the replacement of 285% of
	        annual production at a Finding and Development ("F&D") cost of $7.61
	        per proven and probable boe before consideration of changes in FDC
	        and $16.95 per boe including the change in FDC.

	    -   At our Glacier Montney natural gas resource play the 2008 F&D cost
	        was $3.48 per proven and probable boe before changes in FDC and
	        $13.14 per boe including changes in FDC. Advantage invested $101
	        million at Glacier in 2008 and increased proven and probable reserves
	        by 29 mmboe and confirmed horizontal well rates of 2.5 to 7.5 mmcfd
	        (417 to 1,250 boe per day). Montney reserves are assigned to only 32
	        of our 88 sections. The reserve assignment is based on an average
	        well density of 2.4 wells per section of land although we currently
	        have regulatory approval to drill up to 8 wells per section
	        consisting of 4 wells in the Upper and 4 wells in the Lower Montney
	        zones. Adjacent operators are currently evaluating 16 wells per
	        section which may lead to significant future reserve additions.
	        Further delineation drilling is required to evaluate the undeveloped
	        land potential in the remaining 56 sections. Our independent reserve
	        evaluator, Sproule Associates Limited ("Sproule") included the
	        following comment in their December 31, 2008 Glacier reserves report:

	           "The Proved and Probable reserves assigned by Sproule to the
	           Montney zone at Glacier, as of December 31, 2008 represent a
	           significant increase in reserve assignment compared to the
	           December 31, 2007 reserves assigned. However, the reserves
	           assigned still represent a relatively small percentage of the
	           total resource potential for the Upper and Lower Montney zone on
	           the Glacier land holdings."

	    -   The balance of our 2008 capital development program of $155 million
	        was directed to key properties such as Nevis, Martin Creek, Willesden
	        Green, Northville, Brazeau and Youngstown where better than expected
	        results were obtained.

	           -  At Nevis, continued light oil drilling in the Wabamun formation
	              extended the field and resulted in numerous wells with initial
	              production exceeding 200 boe per day. A 35 gross (27 net) well
	              Horseshoe Canyon coal bed methane drilling program in 2008 also
	              confirmed several more phases of future drilling. A total of 47
	              gross (38.8 net) wells were drilled at a 100% success rate for
	              a total expenditure of $50 million and added 2,980 boe per day
	              of initial production.

	           -  At Martin Creek, approximately $17 million was invested in a
	              successful 10 well gross (8 net) drilling program in early 2008
	              which added 1,490 boe per day of initial production.

	           -  At Willesden Green, a new light oil pool was discovered with
	              the drilling of 2 gross (2 net) wells with initial combined
	              production of 800 boe per day. In addition, 3 gross (3 net)
	              wells were successfully drilled for liquids rich natural gas
	              production from the Rock Creek formation.

	           -  At Northville, Brazeau and Youngstown, 6 gross (4.3 net) wells
	              were successfully drilled adding additional reserves and
	              defined additional drilling locations.

	    -   The 2008 capital program totaled $263.5 million of which $255.9
	        million was invested in development activities and $7.6 million was
	        expended on a complimentary acquisition at our Nevis property. The
	        Nevis acquisition resulted in increasing our working interest in 9
	        gross sections of land and provided future drilling locations on an
	        additional 4 gross sections for Horseshoe Canyon coal bed methane.
	        Included in our 2008 capital expenditures were $20 million of
	        strategic undeveloped land acquisitions, the majority of which was
	        located at Glacier. A total of 124 gross (86.8 net) wells were
	        drilled in 2008 at a 99% success rate.

	    -   Advantage's total drilling inventory has grown to over 1,000 drilling
	        locations of which 560 is in our conventional assets and over 440 has
	        been confirmed in our Glacier Montney natural gas resource play. The
	        drilling inventory at Glacier could exceed 800 locations depending on
	        the density of horizontal wells that will ultimately be drilled per
	        section of land.

	    Company Interest Reserves increase 15% (11% on a per Unit basis)
	    primarily from Organic Drilling Results

	    -   Proven and probable reserves increased 15% to 174.8 mmboe from 152.2
	        mmboe at year end 2007. Proven reserves increased 7% to 102.3 mmboe
	        from 95.6 mmboe at year end 2007. The Fund's proven plus probable
	        reserve life index increased 26% to 15.2 years compared to 12.1 years
	        at the end of 2007. Natural gas reserves calculate to a reserve life
	        index of 15.9 years, and crude oil and natural gas liquids calculate
	        to a reserve life index of 13.9 years indicative of a very stable
	        producing platform with significant upside potential.

	    -   Ninety eight percent (33.8 mmboe) of total P+P reserve additions
	        (34.4 mmboe) were a result of the Fund's successful drilling program.

	    -   Proven and probable reserves per trust unit increased 11% and proven
	        reserves increased 4% per trust unit compared to year end 2007.

	    -   Advantage's total proven and probable reserves consist of 67% natural
	        gas and 33% crude oil and natural gas liquids.

	    Net Asset Value & Recycle Ratio

	    -   The net asset value ("NAV") calculated using Sproule's December 31,
	        2008 reserves report and price forecasts results in a before tax
	        value of $14.03 per trust unit at a 10% discount rate.

	    -   Based on a 2008 operating netback of $36.54 per boe, the one year
	        recycle ratio is 4.8 times using the FD&A cost of $7.67 per boe
	        before changes to FDC and 2.2 times using the FD&A cost of $16.70 per
	        boe including the changes to FDC.

	    Well Positioned for Future Organic Growth

	    -   Advantage is well positioned to grow by developing our significant
	        natural gas resource at Glacier and continued exploitation and
	        optimization of our long life conventional assets.

	    -   The reserve potential at Glacier which is measured in "TCF's" of
	        natural gas is economic at less than $5 Cdn per mcf. Advantage
	        will utilize a disciplined financial approach to development in order
	        to yield significant long term value growth for Unitholders. As at
	        December 31, 2008 Sproule has assigned 223 BCF (0.223 TCF) of proven
	        and probable natural gas reserves to Glacier which will require
	        future development capital of approximately $0.4 million. Advantage
	        estimates that fully developing the Montney resource potential at
	        Glacier will require additional capital expenditures in excess of
	        $2.5 billion over the life of the project which, if properly
	        deployed, could result in significant reserve and production growth.



	                                   RESERVES

	    Advantage engaged our independent qualified reserves evaluator Sproule
	    Associates Ltd. ("Sproule") to update the reserves analysis for the Fund
	    in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 and the COGE Handbook.

	    (1) Advantage's crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid reserves
	        were evaluated using Sproule's product price forecast effective
	        December 31, 2008 prior to the provision for income taxes, interests,
	        debt services charges and general and administrative expenses. It
	        should not be assumed that the discounted future revenue estimated by
	        Sproule represents the fair market value of the reserves.

	    Sproule Price Forecasts

	    The present value of future net revenue at December 31, 2008 was based
upon crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions prepared by Sproule
effective December 31, 2008. These forecasts are adjusted for reserve quality,
transportation charges and the provision of any applicable sales contracts.
The price assumptions used over the next seven years are summarized in the
table below:

	    The Sproule price forecast does not include the impact of Advantage's
commodity price hedging program. We currently have 56% of our net natural gas
production hedged at an average price of $8.09 Cdn/mmbtu for 2009 and 48%
hedged for 2010 at an average price of $7.46 Cdn/mmbtu. Crude oil hedges
include 46% of our net crude oil production hedged at an average floor price
of $69.38 Cdn/bbl for 2009 and 26 % hedged for 2010 at an average price of
$67.83 Cdn/bbl.

	    (1) Under NI 51-101, the methodology to be used to calculate FD&A costs
	        includes incorporating changes in future development capital ("FDC")
	        required to bring the proved undeveloped and probable reserves to
	        production. For continuity, Advantage has presented herein FD&A costs
	        calculated both excluding and including FDC.
	        The aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in
	        the most recent financial year and the change during that year in
	        estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total
	        finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that
	        year. Changes in forecast FDC occur annually as a result of
	        development activities, acquisition and disposition activities and
	        capital cost estimates that reflect Sproule's best estimate of what
	        it will cost to bring the proved undeveloped and probable reserves on
	        production.
	        In all cases, the FD&A number is calculated by dividing the
	        identified capital expenditures by the applicable reserve additions.
	        Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe
	        conversion ratio of 6 MCF:1 BBL is based on an energy equivalency
	        conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not
	        represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.

	    Advisory

	    The information in this press release contains certain forward-looking
statements. These statements relate to future events or our future
performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not
always, identified by the use of words such as "seek", "anticipate", "plan",
"continue", "estimate", "expect", "may", "will", "project", "predict",
"potential", "targeting", "intend", "could", "might", "should", "believe",
"would" and similar expressions. These statements involve substantial known
and unknown risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond Advantage's
control, including: the impact of general economic conditions; industry
conditions; changes in laws and regulations including the adoption of new
environmental laws and regulations and changes in how they are interpreted and
enforced; fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange and interest
rates; stock market volatility and market valuations; volatility in market
prices for oil and natural gas; liabilities inherent in oil and natural gas
operations; uncertainties associated with estimating oil and natural gas
reserves; competition for, among other things, capital, acquisitions, of
reserves, undeveloped lands and skilled personnel; incorrect assessments of
the value of acquisitions; changes in income tax laws or changes in tax laws
and incentive programs relating to the oil and gas industry and income trusts;
geological, technical, drilling and processing problems and other difficulties
in producing petroleum reserves; and obtaining required approvals of
regulatory authorities. Advantage's actual results, performance or achievement
could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such
forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurances can be given that
any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire
or occur or, if any of them do, what benefits that Advantage will derive from
them. Except as required by law, Advantage undertakes no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. For additional risk
factors in respect of Advantage and its business, please refer to it Annual
Information Form dated March 28, 2008 which is available on SEDAR at
www.sedar.com.
	    References in this press release to initial test production rates,
initial "flow" rates and "flush" production rates are useful in confirming the
presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the
rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter.
While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates
in calculating the aggregate production for the Fund.
	    Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or billion of cubic feet of gas
equivalent (BcfGE) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe
conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand
cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel and a BcfGE conversion ratio has been
calculated using a conversion rate of 1 million barrels of oil to six billion
cubic feet of gas. Such conversion rates are based on an energy equivalency
conversion method application at the burner tip and do not represent an
economic value equivalency at the wellhead.
