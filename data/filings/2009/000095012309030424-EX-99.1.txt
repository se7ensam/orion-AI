Agrium Earns $370-Million in Second Quarter 2009; Sees Strong Fundamentals

CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - Aug. 5, 2009) -

ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$

Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today its second highest quarterly
net earnings at $370-million ($2.35 diluted earnings per share) for the
second quarter of 2009.

"Solid results from Retail, Advanced Technologies and our Wholesale nitrogen
businesses resulted in Agrium achieving our second strongest quarterly net
earnings in our history. We were able to do this despite the challenge of a
short-term reduction in potash and phosphate application rates and Retail
crop nutrient margins. The outlook for our businesses and products remains
strong and we are starting to see signs of improving demand fundamentals as
we approach the fall season. Our Retail crop protection and seed businesses
in particular delivered excellent results and we ended the season with normal
crop nutrient inventories in our Retail business. We continue to anticipate a
recovery in potash demand later in the second half of 2009." said Mike
Wilson, Agrium President and CEO.

With respect to Agrium's proposal to acquire CF Industries Holdings, Inc.
("CF"), Mr. Wilson stated "We remain fully committed to acquiring CF, with
continued conviction that an Agrium and CF combination would create
significant value for all stockholders and other stakeholders. We will
continue to press CF to execute a mutually beneficial merger agreement
despite the fact that CF has so far ignored a clear mandate from their
stockholders' to conclude a transaction with us. Our offer remains far
superior to any alternative articulated by CF, including remaining
independent or paying a premium for Terra."

The 2009 second quarter results included gains of $15-million ($0.07 diluted
earnings per share) on derivative financial instruments and a $4-million
expense in stock-based compensation for the quarter. It also included an
inventory write-down of $32-million (a $0.15 decrease in diluted earnings per
share) primarily associated with our Wholesale purchase for resale business.

Similar to previous years, we intend to provide earnings guidance for the
second half of the year when we release our third quarter results.

KEY RESULTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

- - The strength of our crop protection and seed businesses was evident again
this quarter providing excellent results for these product groups, jointly
contributing $480-million in gross profit, 80 percent of Retail's total gross
profit in the second quarter. Despite significantly reduced fertilizer rates
and temporarily low crop nutrient margins we expect EBITDA from our Retail
business to approximate $400-million in 2009.(1) Retail EBITDA of
$307-million in the second quarter of 2009 was the second highest of any
quarter, behind only last year's exceptional second quarter results. Despite
crop nutrient use being well below normal, we moved through the majority of
our high cost crop nutrient inventory position and did not incur any
inventory write-down in our Retail business in 2009.

- - Wholesale performance, for urea and ammonia products in particular, was
strong this quarter with nitrogen contributing $182-million in gross profit,
86 percent of Wholesale's total gross profit. Equity earnings from our MOPCO
Egyptian investment were an impressive $10-million this quarter. Potash
margins were $377 per tonne but sales volumes were well below historical
levels.

- - Recent potash settlements in India have provided additional clarity to
global potash prices and we anticipate demand to recover to normal levels in
both our Retail and Wholesale businesses in the second half of 2009.(2)
Agrium remains committed to our brownfield expansion and continues to
evaluate greenfield opportunities.

(1) In the first quarter of 2009, a forward-looking statement indicated that
2009 Retail EBITDA was expected to be close to $0.5-billion. With lower
realized fertilizer margin in the second quarter of 2009, our expectation for
2009 Retail EBITDA is updated to approximately $0.4-billion.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

August 5, 2009

The following interim management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) updates our
annual MD&A included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, to which our
readers are referred. No update is provided where an item is not material or
there has been no material change from the discussion in our annual MD&A.

2009 Second Quarter Operating Results

NET EARNINGS

Agrium's second quarter consolidated net earnings were $370-million, or $2.35
diluted earnings per share, compared to net earnings of $636-million, or
$4.00 diluted earnings per share, for the same quarter of 2008. Consolidated
net earnings for the first half of 2009 were $310-million, or $1.97 diluted
earnings per share, compared to $831-million, or $5.24 diluted earnings per
share, for the same period last year. Net earnings before interest expense
and income taxes ("EBIT") were $543-million for the second quarter of 2009
compared with EBIT of $972-million for the second quarter of 2008. EBIT for
the first half of 2009 was $487-million compared with EBIT of $1.3-billion
for the first half of 2008. A reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings is
provided in the section "Non-GAAP Measures". Consolidated gross profit in the
second quarter of 2009 was $890-million, a $371-million decrease compared to
$1.3-billion in the second quarter of 2008. Consolidated gross profit in the
first half of 2009 was $1.2-billion, a $490-million decrease compared to
$1.7-billion for the same period of 2008. The decreases in
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year EBIT and gross profit were primarily
due to



reduced potash sales volumes and lower selling prices for most
products. For discussion on the performance of each business unit, see
section "Business Segment Performance".

Expenses were $90-million higher in the second quarter and $332-million
higher in the first half of 2009 compared to the same periods last year due
primarily to significantly lower gains on derivative financial instruments
and an increase in Retail selling expenses due the inclusion of the UAP
business since May 5, 2008, partly offset by lower stock-based compensation
expense and lower potash profit taxes.

The effective tax rate was 28 percent for both the second quarter and first
half of 2009, compared with an effective tax rate of 33 percent for the
corresponding periods of 2008. The lower tax rate was due to a higher
proportion of income earned in lower taxed jurisdictions in 2009.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE

Retail

Retail's 2009 second quarter net sales were $3.1-billion, which was 26
percent higher than the $2.5-billion in the second quarter of 2008. Gross
profit was $597-million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to
$667-million for the same period last year while Retail EBIT was $283-million
in the second quarter of 2009, versus EBIT of $409-million in the second
quarter of 2008 and $142-million in the same quarter of 2007. Retail results
are not directly comparable to the same period last year due to the inclusion
of UAP, which was acquired on May 5, 2008.

Crop nutrients net sales were $1.3-billion this quarter, an increase of
$59-million compared to the second quarter of 2008. The increase was due to
the additional five weeks of UAP business recorded this quarter, which was
mostly offset by a significant reduction in Legacy Agrium Retail sales
volumes versus the same period last year. Gross profit was $117-million this
quarter compared to $335-million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease
was due to lower sales volumes from Legacy Agrium Retail and significantly
lower margins resulting from the carryover of higher priced crop nutrient
inventories from the fall of 2008, which were sold into a lower price
environment this spring. This resulted in crop nutrient margins averaging 9
percent in the second quarter of 2009, compared to 27 percent in the second
quarter of 2008 or 24 percent in 2007 which was a more normal year. We
anticipate crop nutrient margins to continue to improve in the second half of
2009 and are expected to reach near-normal levels in the fourth quarter as
the majority of the higher priced nutrient inventory position will have been
sold.(1) North American nutrient sales volumes in the second quarter were
also influenced by the late, wet spring season which impacted farmers'
ability to apply crop nutrients. Sales volumes and margins in our South
American operations were also significantly lower this quarter than the same
period last year due to extremely dry conditions and the added challenge of
uncertainty over government policies. We anticipate improved sales volumes in
the second half of 2009 as growers catch up on reduced application rates over
the past year.(1)

Crop protection net sales increased by 41 percent this quarter, reaching
$1.2-billion in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $860-million in the
same period last year. Our gross profit this quarter reached $304-million, an
increase of $81-million over last year's $223-million. The strength of

earnings from this product line illustrates the benefits of the diversity in
our Retail business. Most of the increase in sales and gross profits was due
to the addition of a full quarter of UAP's significant crop protection
business, including a broad range of private label products. Crop protection
product margins as a percentage of net sales were 25 percent for the second
quarter of 2009 as compared to 26 percent for the same period last year
primarily due to lower margins on glyphosate products.

Net sales for seed, services and other increased by 59 percent, to
$629-million this quarter, from $396-million in the second quarter of 2008.
Gross profit was $176-million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to
$109-million for the same period last year. Seed sales accounted for about
$530-million in sales and $104-million in gross profit for the quarter.

Retail selling expenses for the second quarter of 2009 were $273-million, a
29 percent increase over last year's level, primarily due to the inclusion of
an additional five weeks of UAP business. Selling expenses as a percentage of
net sales in the second quarter of 2009 were slightly higher on a quarter
over quarter basis.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were $950-million for the second quarter of 2009
compared to $1.4-billion for the second quarter of 2008. Gross profit was
$212-million in the second quarter of 2009, a $370-million reduction from the
record second quarter for 2008 of $582-million. EBIT of $215-million in the
second quarter of 2009 was significantly lower than the $647-million earned
in the second quarter of 2008. The key factors impacting the results were
lower sales prices and volumes for nitrogen and phosphate products combined
with significantly lower potash sales volumes and lower gains on derivative
financial instruments.

Nitrogen gross profit was $182-million this quarter, compared to $246-million
in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen prices were lower than the same
period last year across all products for both benchmark and Agrium's realized
prices. Sales volumes were similar to the same period last year, with lower
UAN sales volumes, offset by higher Profertil export sales. Nitrogen cost of
product was $227 per tonne this quarter, a 27 percent decrease versus last
year. The lower production cost was a result of lower North American gas
prices and favorable movement in foreign exchange rates. Agrium's nitrogen
margins averaged $146 per tonne this quarter, compared with $196 per tonne in
the second quarter of last year. Ammonia margins were higher than the same
quarter last year. Urea margins were lower than last year but remained well
over $100 per tonne.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $4.59/MMBtu in the second quarter of
2009 versus $7.36/MMBtu in the second quarter of 2008. The U.S. benchmark
(NYMEX) natural gas price for the second quarter of 2009 was $3.60/MMBtu,
versus $10.80/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $4.86/MMBtu in the
first quarter of 2009. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was $0.49/MMBtu
for the second quarter of 2009.



Phosphate gross profit was $12-million, compared to $96-million for the same
quarter last year. Sales volumes were 12 percent lower than the same quarter
last year. Realized sales prices averaged $454 per tonne which were 43
percent less than the $791 per tonne achieved in the same quarter last year.
Benchmark phosphate prices for the same comparative period were down about 70
percent as compared to the second quarter of 2008. Phosphate cost of product
decreased $60 per tonne to $408 per tonne compared to the second quarter of
2008, due to lower sulphur, ammonia and rock costs. Gross margin for
phosphate was $46 per tonne compared with $323 per tonne in the second
quarter of 2008.

Potash gross profit was $23-million versus $184-million in the second quarter
of 2008. Realized selling prices were 81 percent higher than last year's
levels and contributed to higher per tonne margins. The higher prices were
more than offset by the impact of a significant decrease in sales volumes and
higher cost of product due to lower production volumes. Sales volumes
decreased by 513,000 tonnes compared to the same period last year. Both
international and domestic demand were significantly lower than normal due to
a combination of delayed contract settlements in China and India, credit
issues in many other international markets and the current cautious approach
to replenishing stocks by retailers and distributors in North America and
globally. Cost of product on a per tonne basis increased substantially from
the same quarter of 2008 due to lower production volumes, resulting in a
larger proportion of fixed costs being allocated to fewer sales tonnes. Gross
margin on a per tonne basis was $377 per tonne, which was 17 percent above
the $321 per tonne in the second quarter of last year.

Purchase for resale sales volumes were 81 percent higher in the second
quarter of 2009 than last year's levels, largely due to the addition of the
European CMF business. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2009 was a loss
of $28-million versus $29-million in gross profit for the same period last
year. The reduction was due to a 34 percent decrease in overall realized
selling price compared to last year's levels and a $29-million inventory
write-down this quarter as a result of net realizable value adjustments to
our purchased product inventories.

Wholesale expenses were $62-million higher in the second quarter of 2009 than
for the same period last year due primarily to a lower gain in derivative
financial instruments compared to the same period last year. Unrealized net
mark-to-market gains of $38-million and realized losses of $34-million from
natural gas, power and other derivatives in the second quarter of 2009 were
both lower than the significant gains experienced in the same period last
year. This variance in derivative valuations was partially offset by a
decrease in potash profit and capital taxes of $43-million, due mainly to
lower potash sales volumes.

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' second quarter 2009 net sales were $82-million
compared to $107-million in the second quarter of 2008. Net sales and gross
profit were impacted by reduced volumes and margins in turf and ornamental
due to lower household expenditures as a result of the slower economic
growth. ESN net sales were impacted primarily by lower selling prices as
benchmark urea prices were less than half what they were in the second
quarter of last year. However, gross profit for ESN was largely unchanged, as
slightly lower sales volumes were offset by expanded per tonne margins, as



lower costs more than offset lower sales prices. Year to date ESN sales
volumes and gross profit are both higher compared to 2008.

Gross profit for Advanced Technologies was $17-million for the quarter,
compared with $20-million for the same period last year, while EBITDA was
$12-million, a decrease of $3-million versus the comparable period in 2008.
The reduction in EBITDA was due to weaker demand and margins from a number of
our controlled-release products other than ESN, due to lower housing starts
and a depressed economy. In the second quarter, ESN accounted for 35 percent
of Advanced Technologies' gross profit, an increase from the 29 percent in
the same period last year.

Other

EBIT for our Other non-operating business unit for the second quarter of 2009
was $37-million, an increase of $132-million over the loss of $95-million for
the second quarter of 2008. EBIT for Other for the first half of 2009 was
$17-million, an increase of $130-million over the loss of $113-million for
the same period of 2008. The increases in EBIT for the second quarter and
first half of 2009 reflected a significant decrease in stock-based
compensation expense driven by lower increases in our share price in the
corresponding periods of 2009 and recognition of gross profit deferred by
Wholesale in 2008 on the sales of products to Retail now sold to external
customers in 2009.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities was $199-million in the second quarter
of 2009, compared with cash used in operating activities of $317-million in
the same period of 2008. Cash provided by operating activities was
$271-million in the first half of 2009, a $198-million increase from the same
period of last year. Driving this quarter change was the unusually high
change in non-cash working capital that occurred in the second quarter of
2008 when inventory increased significantly reflecting the price escalation
that occurred in the agricultural sector last spring and a significant
reduction in prepaid expenses and deposits. This was partially offset by a
$266-million decrease in net earnings and a $343-million non-cash decrease in
future income tax liabilities. Driving the year-over-year change was a
$0.9-billion increase in non-cash working capital due to a significant
reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, in addition to a decrease in unrealized gain on derivative
financial instruments. This was partially offset by a $521-million decrease
in net earnings and a $360-million non-cash decrease in future income tax
liabilities.

December 31, 2008:

============================================================================


Cash used in investing activities decreased by $2.7-billion in the second
quarter and first half of 2009 both primarily due to the UAP acquisition in
the second quarter of 2008 and lower capital expenditures in the first half
of 2009.

Cash provided by financing activities was $74-million in the second quarter
of 2009 compared with $1.6-billion in the same period of 2008. Cash used in
financing activities was $127-million in the first half of 2009, compared
with cash provided by financing of $1.6-billion in the same period of 2008.
The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes reflected the issuance of
long-term debt and bank indebtedness of $1.2-billion used to finance the UAP
acquisition in the second quarter of 2008 and a pay-down of our bank
indebtedness in the first half of 2009.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently,
quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. Sales are
concentrated in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced
inventories are accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally
occur after the planting seasons in North and South America. In addition, our
acquisition of UAP on May 5, 2008 impacts the comparability of quarterly
results.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 25, 2009, Agrium submitted a proposal to the board of directors
of CF to acquire all of the capital stock of CF for cash and Agrium shares at
$72.00 per CF share, or a total of approximately $3.6-billion, based on the



closing price of Agrium shares on February 24, 2009. Agrium would fund the
cash portion through available liquidity and committed financing. The board
of directors of CF rejected Agrium's proposal on March 9, 2009.

On March 16, 2009, Agrium commenced an exchange offer for all of the
outstanding shares of CF (the "Offer"), pursuant to which CF stockholders
would receive $31.70 in cash plus one common share of Agrium for each CF
share. The Offer is subject to a number of conditions, including the
negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and regulatory approvals under
Canadian and U.S. antitrust legislation. The Canadian Competition Bureau and
the Federal Trade Commission (United States) are reviewing the transaction.
On March 27, 2009, Agrium announced an increase in the cash portion to
$35.00, for an aggregate consideration of $1.8 billion in cash and 50.2
million shares. On May 11, 2009, Agrium announced an increase in the cash
portion to $40.00 for an aggregate cash consideration not to exceed $2.01
billion. The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire on August 19, 2009,
unless extended. The CF board of directors has rejected the Offer.

Agrium is fully committed to acquiring CF and intends to continue to press
the board of directors of CF to execute a mutually beneficial merger
agreement for our respective shareholders. Agrium has had extensive
discussions with CF shareholders, who have advised Agrium that they favour a
combination between Agrium and CF and want the CF board to engage in
discussions with us. Agrium is prepared to increase its Offer further if CF
can demonstrate additional value.

The rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") do not require that we obtain
the approval of our shareholders, but the TSX has the discretion to require
us to obtain shareholder approval. During February 2009, we acquired 1.2
million shares of CF at an average cost of $52.34 for the total consideration
of $65-million, the maximum allowed under FTC regulations. The shares are
classified for accounting purposes as available for sale financial
instruments with changes to the fair value being recorded in other
comprehensive income. At June 30, 2009, the fair value of the CF shares was
$92-million.

EGYPT NITROGEN PROJECT

In the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with MOPCO,
whereby MOPCO would acquire EAgrium and all related contractual obligations
through a share exchange. The share exchange was completed on January 26,
2009, which resulted in our owning 26 percent of MOPCO. We account for our
investment in MOPCO in the Wholesale business unit using the equity method.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS ("IFRS")

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' Accounting Standards Board
has published its strategic plan for convergence of Canadian generally
accepted accounting standards with IFRS as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board. The changeover date for Canadian publicly
accountable enterprises is January 1, 2011 and will require restatement of
comparative figures.

Agrium is currently in the design and development phase of its IFRS
transition plan. To date, progress remains on plan for a successful IFRS
implementation.



At this time, the full impact of transitioning to IFRS on the Company's
future financial position and future operational results is not reasonably
determinable or estimable. We continue to assess the available transitional
exemption options along with the accounting policies under IFRS and the
resulting impacts.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the
primary measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to
EBIT (net earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net
earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization
and asset impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of
performance because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not
synonymous and we believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the
comparability of historical performance for the different business segments.
Similarly, financing and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all
business segments on a basis that is meaningful for comparison with other
companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA
should not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating
activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net earnings as
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

BUSINESS RISKS

The information presented on business risks on pages 85 - 90 in our 2008
Annual Report has not changed materially since December 31, 2008.

CONTROLS & PROCEDURES

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the six months ended June 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

A second consecutive year of delayed corn and soybean planting in the U.S.
Corn Belt led to a high level of volatility in grain and oilseed prices
during the second quarter. Grain prices came under pressure following the
completion of spring planting and pressured further when the USDA reported
significantly higher than expected corn and soybean planted area at the end
of June. Prices have stabilized since then, but significant uncertainty
remains with respect to global grain and oilseed production and prices for
2009/10 at this early stage of the year. The USDA is currently forecasting
that global grain ending stocks will increase slightly. This assumes normal
yields globally, although weather and crop nutrient levels will play an
important role in determining final yields. Dry weather has hampered grain
production in Western Canada and Argentina, leading to the lowest planted
area of wheat in Argentina in recent history. In addition, monsoon rains in
India are below normal for the first two months of the growing season. The
significant reduction in global fertilizer use this past year is expected to
have some impact on yield potential this year and could result in potential
nutrient deficiencies for 2010/11, which could lead to higher than normal
application rates starting this fall.

Wet spring weather delayed demand for crop protection products in North
America this year but higher corn acreage provided solid demand for seed and
most crop protection products. The one exception was lower demand for
glyphosate based products this spring. We expect retail demand for glyphosate
to improve in the second half of the year after declining 19 percent in the
first half of 2009. Stronger than historical grain prices and crop margins
are expected to support continued growth in the seed and crop protection
product lines into the next crop year.

The outlook globally for urea and ammonia markets appears stable as producers
are comfortable with their bookings through August. This has been supported
by increased demand from India, Pakistan and Brazil and seasonal turnaround
at a number of facilities internationally. Urea prices in the U.S. Gulf have
increased 20 percent since May, and have returned to a point where the U.S.
has become an attractive market for imports. U.S. urea imports for the first
five months of 2009 were down 11 percent from 2008 levels, which have
contributed to tight U.S. inventory levels. Chinese export taxes on urea are
currently 10 percent and will remain at that level until September 15, at
which time they are expected to increase to 110 percent until the end of



October. Chinese offer prices have increased in parallel with global prices
and are currently acting as a cap on the market. The UAN market may
experience additional pressure relative to urea prices in late 2009 as the
new Trinidad UAN facility is expected to come on-stream at that time. At
current crude oil prices, European formula-based natural gas prices will
increase in the fourth quarter which could put upward pressure on nitrogen
prices.

The delay in 2009 contracts between major potash producers and Chinese and
Indian buyers created considerable uncertainty in the marketplace, resulting
in many other buyers delaying their purchasing decisions. As a result,
producers have continued to reduce capacity utilization. In the first six
months of 2009, TFI reported North American potash production was down over
60 percent from the high rates in 2008, and North American inventory levels
were at historically high levels at the end of June. Recent contract
agreements between India and global potash producers have been concluded at
prices significantly below 2008 contract values. This is expected to
influence benchmark prices for the near term but has provided additional
clarity on prices to the market. As a result, demand is expected to improve
in the second half of 2009 and rebound strongly in 2010. There continues to
be uncertainty with respect to both volumes and price of 2009 potash
contracts with China.

Global phosphate markets have recently shown some signs of stabilizing. The
TFI reported U.S. DAP/MAP June inventory levels were 9 percent below the five
year average and only 4 percent above 2008 levels. Apparent wholesale DAP/MAP
disappearance in the U.S. was down 37 percent in the 2008/09 fertilizer year
compared to the previous year. We anticipate global and North American demand
will continue to recover in the second half of 2009 and into 2010. India is
still expected to purchase additional import volumes in the second half of
2009 and South American import demand is expected to continue to improve. The
reduction in Chinese export taxes to 10 percent has been extended through
August, but at current market prices, China is not expected to be a major
factor in the export market. A risk to the phosphate market is a build in
exportable Chinese inventories when the export tax is increased, which could
cap the market in November when the export tax is again reduced.

MOPCO is a private company located in Egypt. In January 2009, Agrium acquired
its 26 percent interest through an agreement exchanging its shares and all
related contractual obligations of its EAgrium subsidiary for shares in
MOPCO. Previously, Agrium's Egypt operations had been carried in its EAgrium
subsidiary.

As at December 31, 2008, the Company adjusted the carrying value of its Egypt
operations based on the fair value of the MOPCO interest received. Prior to
such adjustment, the Egypt operations had a net carrying value of
$295-million (net of non-controlling interest). The major categories of
assets and liabilities of the EAgrium subsidiary were production assets under
construction, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and bank
indebtedness. On adjusting the Egypt operations to fair value of
$250-million, the Company recorded an impairment charge in its Wholesale
business unit of $87-million ($45-million net of non-controlling interest).

The Company determined the fair value of the interest in MOPCO using an
income approach, discounting a range of possible outcomes, with each possible
outcome bearing different risk factors, at a risk-free rate plus an
adjustment for the risk factors of each scenario. The analysis included
various management estimates about future revenue, operating margins, growth
rates, discount rates, terminal value and non-controlling interest discount.
The assumptions included anticipated future cash flows, budgets and long-term
business plans, marketplace information, industry data, economic analysis and
contracts in place at the time of the analysis. Actual results could differ



from management's estimates and assumptions, potentially resulting in future
impairment losses.

Hanfeng Evergreen Inc. is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The
investment, consisting of 11.9 million common shares, is carried in the
Advanced Technologies business unit.

(a) The Company has committed available facilities, subject to certain
    terms and conditions, of $1.4-billion for the CF acquisition not
    included in the table. The facilities are comprised of $1-billion of
    long-term debt with repayment terms of two to three years and
    $400-million of bank indebtedness. All facilities, if drawn, will bear
    interest at U.S. base rate plus a variable margin or LIBOR plus a
    variable margin. These facilities are available to fund a portion of
    the proposed acquisition of CF and cannot be used for other purposes.

(b) The Company has issued letters of credit under its revolving credit
    facilities. Outstanding letters of credit at June 30, 2009 of
    $67-million reduce unutilized credit available under the facilities to
    $572-million.

(c) Of the total, $136-million is secured. Security pledged for the
    utilized balance includes inventory, accounts receivable and other
    items with a total carrying value of $83-million. The facilities bear
    interest at various base rates plus a fixed or variable margin. The
    utilized balance includes Euro debt of $31-million.

(d) The Company has a revolving purchase and sale agreement to sell, with
    limited recourse, accounts receivable to a maximum of $200-million
    (June 30, 2008 -- $200-million). The receivables are sold to an
    unrelated financial institution. The Company provides a security
    interest to the financial institution in the form of accounts
    receivable in excess of the net cash proceeds received. The
    agreement expires in December 2012. Proceeds from collections
    reinvested in revolving-period securitizations were $685-million for
    the three months ended June 30, 2009 (June 30, 2008 -- nil) and
    $955-million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 (June 30,

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Risk management

In the normal course of business, the Company's financial position, results
of operation and cash flows are exposed to various risks. On an annual basis,
the Board approves a strategic plan that takes into account the opportunities
and major risks of the Company's business and mitigation factors to reduce
these risks. The Board also reviews risk management policies and procedures
on an annual basis and sets upper limits on the transactional exposure to be
managed and the time periods over which exposures may be managed. The Company
manages risk in accordance with its Exposure Management Policy. The objective
of the policy is to reduce volatility in cash flow and earnings.

Sensitivity analysis to risk is provided where the effect on net earnings or
shareholders' equity could be material. Sensitivity analysis is performed by
relating the reasonably possible changes in the risk variable at June 30,
2009 to financial instruments outstanding on that date while assuming all
other variables remain constant.

Market risk



(a) Currency risk

U.S. dollar denominated transactions in our Canadian operations generates
foreign exchange gains and losses on outstanding balances which are
recognized in net earnings. The net U.S. dollar denominated balance in
Canadian operations is $224-million. A strengthening of $0.01 in the U.S.
dollar against the Canadian dollar would have increased net earnings by
$2-million.



Balances in non-U.S. dollar subsidiaries           Canadian
 (in U.S. dollar equivalent)                        dollars            Euro
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 
Cash and cash equivalents                                18               2
Accounts receivable                                     146              61
Bank indebtedness                                         -             (31)
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities               (202)            (18)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        (38)             14
============================================================================


A foreign currency translation adjustment is recognized in other
comprehensive income upon translation of our Canadian and European operations
to U.S. dollars. A strengthening of $0.01 of the Canadian dollar against the
U.S. dollar would have an impact of less than $1-million on other
comprehensive income. A $0.01 weakening of the Canadian dollar would have an
equal but opposite impact. A strengthening of $0.01 of the Euro against the
U.S. dollar would have an impact of less than $1-million on other
comprehensive income. A $0.01 weakening of the Euro would have an equal but
opposite impact.

(b) Commodity price risk

For natural gas derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30,
2009, an increase of $0.10 per MMBtu would have increased net earnings by
$2-million. A $0.10 decrease per MMBtu would have an equal but opposite
impact.

(c) Interest rate risk

The Company's cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments
with a term of three months or less that earn interest at market rates. The
Company manages its interest rate risk on these investments by maximizing the
interest income earned on excess funds while maintaining the liquidity
necessary to conduct operations on a day-to-day basis. Fluctuations in market
rates of interest on cash and cash equivalents do not have a significant
impact on the Company's results of operations due to the short term to
maturity of the investments.

Credit risk

There were no significant uncollectible trade receivable balances at June 30,
2009.



The Company may be exposed to certain losses in the event that counterparties
to short-term investments and derivative financial instruments are unable to
meet their contractual obligations. The Company manages this counterparty
credit risk with policies requiring that counterparties to short-term
investments and derivative financial instruments have an investment grade or
higher credit rating and policies that limit the investing of excess funds to
liquid instruments with a maximum term of one year and limit the maximum
exposure to any one counterparty. The Company also enters into master netting
agreements that mitigate its exposure to counterparty credit risk. At June
30, 2009, all counterparties to derivative financial instruments have
maintained an investment grade or higher credit rating and there is no
indication that any counterparty will be unable to meet their obligations
under derivative contracts.

Liquidity risk

The Company's bank indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued liabilities
generally have contractual maturities of six months or less.

Fair values

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank
indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate
carrying value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of
floating-rate loans approximates their carrying value.

Marketable securities are carried at fair value and measured using
information classified as Level 1 (observable inputs based on unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets).

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is recorded at the
estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the
contracts. The Company's derivative financial instruments measured at fair
value on a recurring basis are measured using information classified as Level
2 (observable inputs based on quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets).

The fair value of long-term debt at June 30, 2009 was $1,630-million (June
30, 2008 - $1,964-million, December 31, 2008 - $1,578-million). The carrying



value of long-term debt at June 30, 2009 was $1,648-million (June 30, 2008 -
$1,921-million, December 31, 2008 - $1,634-million). The weighted-average
effective interest rate on long-term debt at June 30, 2009, was 6 percent
(June 30, 2008 - 5 percent, December 31, 2008 - 6 percent). The fair value of
long-term debt is determined using information classified as Level 2
(valuation techniques based on quoted prices for similar instruments in
active markets).

The following items are carried at fair value, which is equal to carrying
value.

11. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Company manages capital by monitoring the ratios outlined in the table
below. Net debt includes bank indebtedness and long-term debt including the
current portion, net of cash and cash equivalents. Equity includes
shareholders' equity. EBITDA is net earnings before interest expense, income
taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset impairment. Interest includes
interest on long-term debt plus other interest. The measures of debt, equity
and EBITDA described above are non-GAAP financial measures which do not have
a standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.



                                               As at               As at
