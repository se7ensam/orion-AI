    Exhibit 99.1
    News release via Canada NewsWire, Calgary 403-269-7605

	    Attention Business/Financial Editors:
	    Advantage Announces Release of Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December
	    31, 2008 Financial Results

	    (TSX: AVN.UN, NYSE: AAV)

	    CALGARY, March 18 /CNW/ - Advantage Energy Income Fund ("Advantage" or
the "Fund") is pleased to announce the financial and operating results for the
year ended December 31, 2008.

	    <<
	    Funds from Operations Increased 33% and Annual Production Increased 8%

	    -   Strong average natural gas and crude oil prices and excellent
	        drilling results resulted in a 33% increase in funds from operations
	        to $361.1 million for 2008 compared to $271.1 for 2007. Funds from
	        operations on a per unit basis increased 16% to $2.57 per Trust Unit
	        compared to $2.22 per Trust Unit for the year ended December 31,
	        2007.
	    -   Average 2008 daily production increased 8% to 32,273 boe/d compared
	        to 29,962 boe/d for 2007. This was achieved despite 1,100 boe/d (73%
	        natural gas) being curtailed since August 2008 as a result of a third
	        party facility outage at the Lookout Butte property. Fourth quarter
	        production of 31,529 boe/d was impacted by severe cold weather in
	        December and the continuing outage at Lookout Butte.
	    -   Natural gas production for 2008 increased 5% to 122.9 mmcf/d,
	        compared to 117.0 mmcf/d for 2007. Crude oil and natural gas liquids
	        production increased 13% to 11,793 bbls/d compared to 10,462 bbls/d
	        in 2007.
	    -   Operating costs for 2008 increased to $13.89 per boe due to higher
	        cost of service and supplies driven by the increasing commodity price
	        environment for most of the year. Fourth quarter 2008 operating costs
	        was $14.71 per boe due to lower production, the impact of higher
	        third party processing costs, increased property taxes and additional
	        costs due to the severe cold weather that created unplanned equipment
	        repairs.
	    -   The Fund declared distributions totaling $1.40 per Trust Unit with a
	        2008 payout ratio of just 54% as compared to 79% for 2007. Since
	        inception, the Fund has distributed $1.1 billion or $17.66 per Trust
	        Unit.

	    Highly Efficient Reserve Additions from a Very Successful 2008 Drilling
	    Program

	    -   Overall, the Fund replaced 290% of annual production with the vast
	        majority of reserve additions realized through our successful 2008
	        drilling program at Glacier, Alberta where the Fund commenced a
	        significant development drilling program on our Montney natural gas
	        resource play (refer to Advantage's year-end reserves press release
	        dated March 5, 2009).
	    -   Proven and probable reserves increased 15% to 174.8 mmboe from
	        152.2 mmboe at year end 2007. Proven reserves increased 7% to
	        102.3 mmboe from 95.6 mmboe at year end 2007. The Fund's proven plus
	        probable reserve life index increased 26% to 15.2 years compared to
	        12.1 years at the end of 2007. Natural gas reserves calculate to a
	        reserve life index of 15.9 years, and crude oil and natural gas
	        liquids calculate to a reserve life index of 13.9 years, indicative
	        of a very stable producing platform with significant upside
	        potential.
	    -   In 2008, all-in Finding, Development and Acquisition ("FD&A") costs
	        were $7.67 per proven plus probable boe before changes in future
	        development capital ("FDC") and $16.70 per boe including changes in
	        FDC. Drill bit reserve additions alone resulted in the replacement of
	        285% of annual production at a Finding and Development ("F&D") cost
	        of $7.61 per proven and probable boe before consideration of changes
	        in FDC and $16.95 per boe including the change in FDC.
	    -   The 2008 capital program totaled $263.2 million of which
	        $255.6 million was invested in development activities and
	        $7.6 million was expended on a complimentary acquisition at our Nevis
	        property. Advantage invested $101 million at Glacier, which
	        dramatically increased proven and probable reserves. Included in our
	        2008 capital expenditures were $20 million of strategic undeveloped
	        land acquisitions, the majority of which was located at Glacier. A
	        total of 124 gross (86.8 net) wells were drilled in 2008 at a 99%
	        success rate. The $7.6 million Nevis acquisition resulted in
	        increasing our working interest in 9 gross sections of land and
	        provided future drilling locations on an additional 4 gross sections
	        for Horseshoe Canyon coal bed methane.

	    Glacier Montney Results Confirms Significant Resource Play Potential

	    -   Advantage invested $101 million at Glacier in 2008 and increased
	        proven and probable reserves by 29 mmboe and confirmed horizontal
	        well rates of 2.5 to 7.5 mmcfd (417 to 1,250 boe per day).
	    -   The 2008 F&D cost at Glacier was $3.48 per proven and probable boe
	        before changes in FDC and $13.14 per boe including changes in FDC.
	    -   Montney reserves are assigned to only 32 of our 89 sections. The
	        reserve assignment is based on an average well density of 2.4 wells
	        per section of land although we currently have regulatory approval to
	        drill up to 8 wells per section consisting of 4 wells in the Upper
	        and 4 wells in the Lower Montney zones. Adjacent operators are
	        currently evaluating 16 wells per section which may lead to
	        significant future reserve additions. Further delineation drilling is
	        required to evaluate the undeveloped land potential in the remaining
	        57 sections. Based on results to date, 440 locations have been
	        confirmed in our extensive Montney land block. The drilling inventory
	        at Glacier could exceed 800 locations depending on the density of
	        horizontal wells that will ultimately be drilled per section of land.
	    -   Advantage estimates that fully developing the Montney resource
	        potential at Glacier will require additional capital expenditures in
	        excess of $2.5 billion over the life of the project which, if
	        properly deployed, could result in significant reserve and production
	        growth. Advantage will utilize a disciplined financial approach to
	        development in order to yield significant long term value growth for
	        Unitholders.

	    Hedging Update

	    -   Advantage's hedging program includes 56% of our net natural gas
	        production hedged for 2009 at an average price of $8.09 Cdn per mcf
	        and 48% hedged for 2010 at an average price of $7.46 per mcf. Crude
	        oil hedges include 46% of our net crude oil production hedged at an
	        average floor price of $69.38 Cdn per bbl and 26% hedged for 2010 at
	        an average price of $67.83 Cdn per bbl. Details on our hedging
	        program are available on our website.

	    Looking Forward

	    -   The Board of Directors approved a 2009 budget with capital
	        expenditures between $100 and $135 million with approximately 46%
	        directed to further developing our Montney natural gas reserves and
	        production at Glacier. As a result of a much lower commodity price
	        environment driven by global economic concerns, Advantage will be
	        very disciplined and proactive to undertake actions as required to
	        balance our capital and cash flows as we prepare for a challenging
	        2009. However, our capital expenditure priority will be to ensure the
	        funding of further development in our Montney resource play at
	        Glacier where the Fund sees significant reserves and production
	        growth potential.
	    -   On March 18, 2009, Advantage announced that our Board of Directors
	        had approved conversion to a growth oriented corporation and a
	        strategic asset disposition program to increase financial
	        flexibility.
	    -   The corporate conversion will be subject to two-thirds Unitholder
	        approval as well as customary court and regulatory approvals,
	        anticipated to be completed on or about June 30, 2009. The conversion
	        will enable Advantage to pursue a business plan that is focused on
	        the development and growth of the Montney natural gas resource play
	        at Glacier. The conversion will have the added benefit of removing
	        the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming changes in Canadian tax law
	        whereby the government will begin imposing taxes on income trusts on
	        January 1, 2011.
	    -   The Fund has retained Tristone Capital Inc. to assist with the
	        disposition of properties producing up to 11,300 boe/d of light oil
	        and natural gas properties located in Northeast British Columbia,
	        West Central Alberta and Northern Alberta. The net proceeds from
	        these sales or other oil and natural gas property sales will
	        initially be used to reduce outstanding bank debt to improve
	        Advantage's financial flexibility. Advantage may also draw down its
	        credit facilities in the future to redeem certain of the Fund's
	        convertible debentures. Proposals are anticipated by mid May 2009 and
	        the selected assets will be available in four distinct packages
	        varying in size from approximately 1,600 to 5,400 boe/d of
	        production.
	    -   As another step to increase Advantage's financial flexibility and to
	        focus on development and growth at Glacier, Advantage will
	        discontinue payment of cash distributions with the final cash
	        distribution paid on March 16, 2009 to unitholders of record as of
	        February 27, 2009. Going forward, Advantage does not anticipate
	        paying distributions or dividends in the immediate future and will
	        instead, direct cash flow to capital expenditures and debt repayment.

	                     Management's Discussion & Analysis
	    >>

	    The following Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"), dated as of
March 18, 2009, provides a detailed explanation of the financial and operating
results of Advantage Energy Income Fund ("Advantage", the "Fund", "us", "we"
or "our") for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 and should be read
in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements. The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and all references
are to Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. All per barrel of oil
equivalent ("boe") amounts are stated at a conversion rate of six thousand
cubic feet of natural gas being equal to one barrel of oil or liquids.

	    Non-GAAP Measures

	    The Fund discloses several financial measures in the MD&A that do not
have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. These financial measures
include funds from operations, funds from operations per Trust Unit and cash
netbacks. Management believes that these financial measures are useful
supplemental information to analyze operating performance, leverage and
provide an indication of the results generated by the Fund's principal
business activities prior to the consideration of how those activities are
financed or how the results are taxed. Investors should be cautioned that
these measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income, cash
provided by operating activities or other measures of financial performance as
determined in accordance with GAAP. Advantage's method of calculating these
measures may differ from other companies, and accordingly, they may not be
comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
	    Funds from operations, as presented, is based on cash provided by
operating activities before expenditures on asset retirement and changes in
non-cash working capital. Funds from operations per Trust Unit is based on the
number of Trust Units outstanding at each distribution record date. Cash
netbacks are dependent on the determination of funds from operations and
include the primary cash revenues and expenses on a per boe basis that
comprise funds from operations. Funds from operations reconciled to cash
provided by operating activities is as follows:

	    Corporate Conversion and Asset Disposition

	    On March 18, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved
conversion to a growth oriented corporation and a strategic asset disposition
program to increase financial flexibility.
	    The corporate conversion will be subject to approval by at least
two-thirds of the Fund's Unitholders as well as customary court and regulatory
approvals, anticipated to be completed on or about June 30, 2009. The
conversion will enable Advantage to pursue a business plan that is focused on
the development and growth of the Montney natural gas resource play at
Glacier. The conversion will have the added benefit of removing the
uncertainty surrounding the upcoming changes in Canadian tax law whereby the
government will begin imposing taxes on income trusts on January 1, 2011.
	    The Fund has retained Tristone Capital Inc. to assist with the
disposition of properties producing up to 11,300 boe/d of light oil and
natural gas properties located in Northeast British Columbia, West Central
Alberta and Northern Alberta. The net proceeds from these sales or other oil
and natural gas property sales will initially be used to reduce outstanding
bank debt to improve Advantage's financial flexibility. Advantage may also
draw down its credit facilities in the future to redeem certain of the Fund's
convertible debentures. Proposals are anticipated by mid May 2009 and the
selected assets will be available in four distinct packages varying in size
from approximately 1,600 to 5,400 boe/d of production.
	    As another step to increase Advantage's financial flexibility and to
focus on development and growth at Glacier, Advantage will discontinue payment
of cash distributions with the final cash distribution paid on March 16, 2009
to unitholders of record as of February 27, 2009. Going forward, Advantage
does not anticipate paying distributions or dividends in the immediate future
and will instead direct cash flow to capital expenditures and debt repayment.
	    Given these business developments, historical operating and financial
performance may not be indicative of future performance depending on the
magnitude of the asset disposition process and pending approval of the
corporate conversion.

	    Cash provided by operating activities and funds from operations have
increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to
2007 due to considerably higher revenue. Our 2008 annual revenue has benefited
from both higher average commodity prices and production. Improved production
is substantially due to the Sound Energy Trust ("Sound") acquisition, which
closed on September 5, 2007, and incremental production from our 2008 drilling
program. The financial and operating results from the acquired Sound
properties are included in all 2008 figures but are only included in the year
ended December 31, 2007 effective from the closing date. Funds from operations
per Trust Unit has also increased significantly, but not in the same
proportion due to the higher number of Trust Units outstanding for 2008. Trust
Units outstanding has increased due to Trust Units issued in exchange for the
Sound acquisition and our distribution reinvestment plan that allows
Unitholders to purchase Trust Units in exchange for their regular monthly cash
distributions.
	    Although cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended
December 31, 2008 is comparable with the same period of 2007, funds from
operations for the current quarter has decreased 14% and funds from operations
per Trust Unit has decreased 16%. These decreases have been due to a slightly
lower average production and a dramatic reduction in crude oil prices. The
fourth quarter of 2008 has seen significant negative economic developments as
a direct result of the global recession, which has triggered a sharp decline
in crude oil prices from lower demand. This challenging situation has
continued into 2009 placing continued downward pressure on commodity prices.
	    The primary factor that causes significant variability of Advantage's
cash provided by operating activities, funds from operations, and net income
is commodity prices. Refer to the section "Commodity Prices and Marketing" for
a more detailed discussion of commodity prices and our price risk management.

	    >>

	    Total distributions declared decreased 21% for the three months and 9%
for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to the same periods in
2007. Total distributions are lower as a result of decreases in the
distribution declared per Trust Unit during these periods. Lower total
distributions were partially offset by additional distributions due to
increased Trust Units outstanding. As commodity prices have weakened, we have
reduced the distribution level to more appropriately reflect the current price
environment. Distributions per Trust Unit were $0.32 for the three months and
$1.40 for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing decreases of 24% and
21% from the same periods in 2007. For the majority of 2008, we paid a monthly
distribution of $0.12 per Trust Unit and reduced the distribution to $0.08 per
Trust Unit effective for the December distribution paid in January. We further
reduced the monthly distribution to $0.04 per Trust Unit for the February
distribution paid in March. On March 18, 2009, we discontinued all future
distributions, consistent with our strategy to reduce debt and convert to a
growth oriented corporation that will focus capital on the Glacier Montney
natural gas resource play.

	    Distribution Taxability

	    For Canadian and U.S. holders of Advantage Trust Units, the distributions
paid for 2008 were 100% taxable. All Unitholders of the Fund are encouraged to
consult their tax advisors as to the proper treatment of Advantage
distributions for income tax purposes.

	    Revenues were significantly higher for the year ended December 31, 2008
due to the full year of additional production from the Sound acquisition and
stronger average commodity prices. During this period, the higher revenue was
partially offset by realized hedging losses that also resulted from the higher
average commodity price environment. Unfortunately, the fourth quarter of 2008
experienced a significant decrease in crude oil and NGL prices, due to the
global recession, and our revenues were substantially impacted. As we had
hedged a significant portion of our production, we also realized hedging gains
during the quarter that partially offset the reduced revenues. The Fund enters
derivative contracts whereby realized hedging gains and losses partially
offset commodity price fluctuations, which can positively or negatively impact
revenues.

	    The Fund's total daily production averaged 32,273 boe/d for the year
ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 8% realized primarily due to the Sound
acquisition, which closed September 5, 2007, and drilling results from our
successful 2008 capital program. Production for the three months ended
December 31, 2008 was 31,529 boe/d, a decrease of 3% from the 32,418 boe/d
realized in the third quarter of 2008. Production of 1,100 boe/d at our
Lookout Butte property in Southern Alberta remained shut-in during the fourth
quarter by an extended third party facility outage that began in August 2008
at the Waterton gas plant where a significant modification project is
underway. Original estimates provided by the third party indicated a potential
outage of approximately 55 to 75 days. However, subsequent information now
indicates that the gas plant may be down until April 1, 2009. Additionally, in
the fourth quarter of 2008 we also experienced freezing conditions from cold
weather that reduced production in December. On March 18, 2009, we announced
the intention to dispose of properties producing up to 11,300 boe/d of light
oil and natural gas properties located in Northeast British Columbia, West
Central Alberta and Northern Alberta. The net proceeds from these sales or
other oil and natural gas property sales will initially be used to reduce
outstanding bank debt to improve Advantage's financial flexibility. Proposals
are anticipated by mid May 2009 and the selected assets will be available in
four distinct packages varying in size from approximately 1,600 to 5,400 boe/d
of production. Assuming asset sales of approximately 10,000 to 11,300 boe/d of
production are completed, we expect production of approximately 20,000 to
22,000 boe/d from a focused asset base (60% natural gas, 40% oil and natural
gas liquids).

	    Realized natural gas prices, excluding hedging, were considerably higher
for the three months and year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 but
have decreased approximately 17% from the third quarter of 2008. The 2007/2008
winter season in North America caused inventory levels, that had been high
prior to winter, to decline to approximately the five-year average. In
addition, reduced liquefied natural gas imports into the US and the slowdown
in natural gas drilling in Western Canada provided upward price support in the
first half of this year. However, during the third and fourth quarters of
2008, there has been significant softening of natural gas prices from higher
US domestic natural gas production, mild weather conditions and forecasts, and
the ongoing global recession that has impacted demand. These factors have
resulted in much higher inventory levels that continue to place considerable
downward pressure on natural gas prices. Unfortunately, these conditions have
also continued well into 2009 with AECO gas presently trading at approximately
$3.80/GJ. Although we continue to believe in the longer-term pricing
fundamentals for natural gas, we are concerned about the current pricing and
economic environment that has the potential to extend for a considerable
period of time. The global recession could delay the recovery of natural gas
pricing longer than anticipated. While the current pricing situation is quite
weak, some of the factors that we believe will support stronger future natural
gas prices include: (i) significantly less natural gas drilling in Canada
projected for 2009, which will reduce productivity to offset declines, (ii)
signs of reduced natural gas drilling in the US, (iii) the increasing focus on
resource style natural gas wells, which have high initial declines, and which
are becoming a larger proportion of the total natural gas supply based in
Canada and the US, and (iv) the demand for natural gas for the Canadian oil
sands projects.

	    Advantage's realized crude oil prices are based on the benchmark pricing
of West Texas Intermediate Crude ("WTI") adjusted for quality, transportation
costs and $US/$Canadian exchange rates. Advantage's realized crude oil price
may not change to the same extent as WTI, due to changes in the $US/$Canadian
exchange rate, and changes in Canadian crude oil differentials relative to
WTI. The price of WTI fluctuates based on worldwide supply and demand
fundamentals. There has been significant price volatility experienced over the
last several years whereby WTI reached historic high levels in 2008, producing
a 36% increase in our average realized crude oil and NGL price, excluding
hedging, for the year. However, as we have seen remarkable crude oil price
increases, we have also seen a similarly dramatic reduction in the later half
of 2008 whereby WTI decreased 35% for the three months ended December 31, 2008
as compared to the same period of 2007 and decreased 50% from the third
quarter of 2008. This decline has had a significant negative impact on our
realized crude oil and NGL price, excluding hedging, that has dropped 27% for
the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to same quarter of 2007 and decreased
50% from the third quarter of 2008. WTI has continued to decline in 2009 to
approximately US$47/bbl, the result of demand destruction brought on by the
current global recession. The impact from this decrease in WTI will be
somewhat mitigated for Advantage due to the strengthening US dollar relative
to the Canadian dollar. As with natural gas, it seems evident that the global
recession will likely prolong depressed crude oil prices through the coming
year. Regardless of this significant decrease, we believe that the longer-term
pricing fundamentals for crude oil remain strong with many factors affecting
the continued strength including (i) supply management and supply restrictions
by the OPEC cartel, (ii) frequent civil unrest in various crude oil producing
countries and regions, (iii) strong relative worldwide demand in developing
countries, particularly in China and India, and (iv) production declines and
reduced drilling due to the lower price environment.

	    Commodity Price Risk

	    The Fund's operational results and financial condition will be dependent
on the prices received for oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas
prices have fluctuated widely during recent years and are determined by
economic and, in the case of oil prices, political factors. Supply and demand
factors, including weather and general economic conditions as well as
conditions in other oil and natural gas regions, impact prices. Any movement
in oil and natural gas prices could have an effect on the Fund's financial
condition and performance. As current and future practice, Advantage has
established a financial hedging strategy and may manage the risk associated
with changes in commodity prices by entering into derivatives. Although these
commodity price risk management activities could expose Advantage to losses or
gains, entering derivative contracts helps us to stabilize cash flows and
ensures that our capital expenditure program is substantially funded by such
cash flows. To the extent that Advantage engages in risk management activities
related to commodity prices, it will be subject to credit risk associated with
counterparties with which it contracts. Credit risk is mitigated by entering
into contracts with only stable, creditworthy parties and through frequent
reviews of exposures to individual entities.
	    We have been active in entering new financial contracts to protect future
cash flows and currently the Fund has the following derivatives in place:

	    For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized in income a realized
derivative loss of $27.4 million on settled derivative contracts (2007 - $18.6
million realized derivative gain). As at December 31, 2008, the fair value of
derivative contracts remaining to be settled was an approximate $41.0 million
net asset (December 31, 2007 - $2.2 million net asset) resulting in the
recognition of a $38.8 million unrealized derivative gain for the 2008 year
(2007 - $11.0 million unrealized derivative loss) due to changes in fair value
since December 31, 2007. The valuation of the derivatives is the estimated
fair value to settle the contracts as at December 31, 2008 and is based on
pricing models, estimates, assumptions and market data available at that time.
As such, the unrealized amounts are not cash and the actual gains or losses
realized on eventual cash settlement can vary materially due to subsequent
fluctuations in commodity prices as compared to the valuation assumptions.
These fair values are extremely sensitive to assumptions regarding forward
commodity prices as demonstrated from our recognized $34.0 million unrealized
derivative gain during the fourth quarter of 2008 as commodity prices
continued to decrease and the $7.0 million net derivative asset recognized at
September 30, 2008 is now valued as a $41.0 million net asset. The Fund does
not apply hedge accounting and current accounting standards require changes in
the fair value to be included in the consolidated statement of loss and
comprehensive loss as an unrealized derivative gain or loss with a
corresponding derivative asset and liability recorded on the balance sheet.
Our outstanding derivative contracts will settle from January 2009 to March
2011 corresponding to when Advantage will receive revenues from production.

	    Advantage pays royalties to the owners of mineral rights from which we
have leases. The Fund currently has mineral leases with provincial
governments, individuals and other companies. Royalties for the year have
increased in total due to the increase in revenue from higher production and
commodity prices. However, total royalties for the fourth quarter have
decreased as both production and prices are lower as compared to the same
quarter of 2007. Royalties as a percentage of revenue, excluding hedging, have
modestly increased as higher prices generally attract a higher royalty rate.
Royalty rates are dependent on prices and individual well production levels
such that average royalty rates will vary as the nature of our properties
change through ongoing development activities and acquisitions. Our royalty
rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was slightly lower than expected due to
the recognition of several royalty credits during the period. We expect the
royalty rate to be in the range of 18% to 20% for 2009 given current commodity
prices and the Fund's production levels.
	    The Alberta Provincial Government implemented a new royalty framework for
conventional oil, natural gas and oil sands effective January 1, 2009.  Given
the methodology used in the new royalty regime, royalties and as a result,
cash flows will be affected by depths and productivity of wells. In addition,
royalties are price sensitive with higher royalty levels applying when
commodity prices are higher. Lower rate natural gas wells will see a benefit
of lower royalties while conventional oil will be subject to an increase in
royalties that is again less punitive at lower rates. Commodity prices and
individual well production rates are both key factors in the calculation. The
majority of Advantage's production in Alberta comes from lower rate wells due
to well-established large, long life properties. In addition, we have a
significant presence in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Therefore, the
impact may not be significant based on our current production and the current
commodity price environment. Advantage will take the new royalty regime into
consideration in preparing future development projects. Project economics are
evaluated taking into consideration all relevant factors including the new
royalty regime given the commodity pricing environment anticipated. Those
projects that maximize return to Advantage Unitholders will continue to be
selected for development.
	    On March 3, 2009, the Alberta Government released a three-part incentive
program aimed to stimulate new economic activity. The first part of the plan
includes a one-year drilling royalty credit of $200 per metre drilled based on
a sliding scale dependant on 2008 corporate production in the Province of
Alberta. The second part of the plan includes a one-year new well incentive
program which offers a maximum five percent royalty rate for the first year of
production from new oil or gas wells. Lastly, to encourage the clean-up of
inactive oil and gas wells, the province will invest $30 million in a fund
committed to abandoning and reclaiming oil well sites. We are currently
evaluating the program and our initial assessment is that Advantage will
realize financial benefits from the drilling incentive and reduced royalty
rate.

	    >>

	    Total operating costs increased 29% for the year ended December 31, 2008
as compared to 2007 primarily due to increased production from the Sound
acquisition, which closed September 5, 2007, and cost escalation driven by the
strong oil and natural gas environment during the first half of 2008.
Operating costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 were up just 4% from $41.2
million incurred in the third quarter of 2008 and 8% higher from the fourth
quarter of 2007. Operating costs reflect a general industry increase which has
continued despite recessionary pressures. Operating costs in the fourth
quarter are 6% higher than the $13.82 realized during the third quarter of
2008. Fourth quarter operating costs per boe were higher primarily due to
lower average quarterly production due primarily to freezing conditions
experienced in December, increased third party processing fees, and higher
property taxes than expected. We anticipate that operating costs in the latter
half of 2009 will decrease as the slower economy will reduce the cost of
services and supplies. We will continue to be opportunistic and proactive in
pursuing optimization initiatives that will improve our operating cost
structure. In 2009, the Fund entered into fixed price power hedges commencing
March 2009 and continuing to December 2009. Under these arrangements, 2.0 MW
have been hedged at an average fixed price of $69.38/MWh. We expect that
operating costs will be in the range of $13.95 to $14.45 per boe for 2009;
however, this will be impacted by the magnitude of our asset disposition
program.

	    >>

	    Total general and administrative ("G&A") expense has decreased 55% for
the three months ended and increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The higher total G&A expense for the year has been primarily due to an
increase in average staff levels that have resulted from the Sound
acquisition, general growth of the Fund, and a one-time payment to terminate
an office lease that occurred in the first quarter of 2008. G&A was lower in
the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the same quarter of 2007 due to
several large nonrecurring expenditures that were recognized in the 2007
period.
	    Current employee compensation includes salary, benefits, a short-term
incentive plan and a long-term incentive plan. The long-term incentive plan
consists of a Restricted Trust Unit Plan (the "Plan"), as approved by the
Unitholders on June 23, 2006. The purpose of the long-term compensation plan
is to retain and attract employees, to reward and encourage performance, and
to focus employees on operating and financial performance that results in
lasting Unitholder return.
	    The Plan authorizes the Board of Directors to grant Restricted Trust
Units ("RTUs") to directors, officers, or employees of the Fund. The number of
RTUs granted is based on the Fund's Trust Unit return for a calendar year and
compared to a peer group approved by the Board of Directors. The Trust Unit
return is calculated at the end of the year and is primarily based on the
year-over-year change in the Trust Unit price plus distributions. If the Trust
Unit return for a year is positive, an RTU grant will be calculated based on
the return and market capitalization. If the Trust Unit return for a year is
negative, but the return is still within the top two-thirds of the approved
peer group performance, the Board of Directors may choose a discretionary RTU
grant. The RTU grants vest one-third immediately on grant date, with the
remaining two-thirds vesting evenly on the following two yearly anniversary
dates. The holders of RTUs may elect to receive cash upon vesting in lieu of
the number of Trust Units to be issued, subject to consent of the Fund.
Compensation cost related to the Plan is recognized as compensation expense
over the service period beginning at the grant date and incorporates the Trust
Unit grant price, the estimated number of RTUs to vest, and certain management
estimates. The maximum amount of RTUs granted in any one calendar year is
limited to 175% of the base salaries of those individuals participating in the
Plan for such period. For 2008, although Advantage experienced a negative
return for the year, the approved peer group also experienced likewise
negative returns. As a result, Advantage's 2008 annual return was within the
top two-thirds of the approved peer group and the Board of Directors granted
an RTU at their discretion. The RTU was deemed to be granted at January 15,
2009 and was valued at $3.8 million to be issued in Trust Units at $5.49 per
Trust Unit. No compensation expense was included in general and administration
expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 as the RTU was granted after
year-end. A total of 171,093 Trust Units were issued to employees in early
2009 in satisfaction of the first third of the grant that vested immediately.
The remaining two-thirds of the RTU grant will vest evenly on the following
two yearly anniversary dates. Since implementing the Plan in 2006, the grant
thresholds have not been previously met, and there have been no RTU grants
made during prior years and no related compensation expense has been
recognized.

	    In 2006, the Fund and Advantage Investment Management Ltd. (the
"Manager") reached an agreement to internalize the pre-existing management
contract arrangement. As part of the agreement, Advantage agreed to purchase
all of the outstanding shares of the Manager pursuant to the terms of the
Arrangement, thereby eliminating the management fee and performance incentive
effective April 1, 2006. The Trust Unit consideration issued in exchange for
the outstanding shares of the Manager was placed in escrow for a 3-year period
and is being deferred and amortized into income as management internalization
expense over the specific vesting periods during which employee services are
provided. The management internalization is lower for the three months and
year ended December 31, 2008 as one third vested and was paid in June 2007
with an additional one third vested and paid in June 2008.

	    >>

	    Interest expense in total and per boe for the full year 2008 has
increased modestly as compared to 2007 primarily due to the additional debt
assumed by the Fund from the Sound acquisition on September 5, 2007. However,
interest expense in total and per boe for the three months ended December 31,
2008 have decreased as compared to the same period of 2007 as a result of
declining interest rates in the fourth quarter. Bank lending rates have
declined significantly in response to rate reductions enacted by central banks
to stimulate the economy. We monitor the debt level to ensure an optimal mix
of financing and cost of capital that will provide a maximum return to our
Unitholders. Our current credit facilities have been a favorable financing
alternative with an effective interest rate of only 5.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2008. The Fund's interest rates are primarily based on short term
Bankers Acceptance rates plus a stamping fee.

	    Interest and accretion on convertible debentures has increased for the
year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 due to Advantage assuming
Sound's 8.75% and 8.00% convertible debentures on the acquisition. The
increased interest and accretion from the additional debentures has been
partially offset by the maturation of both the 10% convertible debentures with
a face value of $1.4 million on November 1, 2007 and the 9% convertible
debentures with a face value of $5.4 million on August 1, 2008. These
debenture maturities have resulted in lower total interest and accretion for
the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period of
2007.

	    Depletion and depreciation of property and equipment is provided on the
"unit-of-production" method based on total proved reserves. Accretion
represents the increase in the asset retirement obligation liability each
reporting period due to the passage of time. The depletion, depreciation and
accretion ("DD&A") provision has increased in total for the year ended
December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007, due to the increase in
production and fixed assets, mainly attributed to the Sound acquisition and
our ongoing capital development program. The slight increase in the DD&A rate
per boe for this period is due to high capital expenditures in 2008 and the
higher value assigned to the Sound acquisition than accumulated from prior
development activities. The total DD&A provision for the three months ended
December 31, 2008 is less than the same period of 2007, because of lower
production. The D&D rate per boe in the fourth quarter was comparable to 2007.

	    Goodwill

	    The Fund frequently assesses goodwill impairment which is effectively a
comparison of the fair value of the Fund to the values assigned to the
identifiable assets and liabilities. The fair value of the Fund is typically
determined by reference to the market capitalization adjusted for a number of
potential valuation factors. The values of the identifiable assets and
liabilities include the current assessed value of our reserves and other
assets and liabilities. Near the end of 2008, Advantage and the entire oil and
gas industry, experienced a substantial decline in market capitalization as a
result of the worldwide recession, resulting soft commodity prices, and
general negative market reaction. As a result, the entire $120.3 million
balance of goodwill was determined to be impaired at December 31, 2008, as
there is no market perception of goodwill.

	    Taxes

	    Current taxes paid or payable for the quarter ended December 31, 2008
amounted to $0.1 million, comparable to the $0.5 million expensed for the same
period of 2007. The higher current taxes for the year are due to the increased
Saskatchewan properties and activity within these properties from the Ketch
and Sound acquisitions. Current taxes primarily represent Saskatchewan
resource surcharge, which is based on the petroleum and natural gas revenues
within the province of Saskatchewan.
	    Future income taxes arise from differences between the accounting and tax
bases of the assets and liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the
Fund recognized a future income tax reduction of $10.8 million compared to
$24.6 million for 2007. Under the Fund's current structure, payments are made
between the operating company and the Fund transferring income tax obligations
to Unitholders and as a result no cash income taxes would be paid by the
operating company or the Fund prior to 2011. However, the Specified Investment
Flow-Through Entity ("SIFT") tax legislation was enacted on June 22, 2007
altering the tax treatment by subjecting income trusts to a two-tier tax
structure, similar to that of corporations, whereby the taxable portion of
distributions paid by trusts will be subject to tax at the trust level and at
the Unitholder level. The rules are effective for tax years beginning in 2011
for existing publicly-traded trusts. The impact of the new tax law has been
reflected in both 2008 and 2007 and resulted in an additional future income
tax expense of $Nil (2007 - $42.9 million). As at December 31, 2008, we had a
future income tax liability balance of $55.9 million, compared to $66.7
million at December 31, 2007. Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles require that a future income tax liability be recorded when the
book value of assets exceeds the balance of tax pools. It further requires
that a future tax liability be recorded on an acquisition when a corporation
acquires assets with associated tax pools that are less than the purchase
price. During the year ended December 31, 2007, Advantage recorded a future
tax liability of $29.4 million with the acquisition of Sound.
	    On December 14, 2007, the Federal government enacted legislation phasing
in corporate income tax rate reductions which will reduce federal tax rates
from 22.1% to 15.0% by 2012. Rate reductions will also apply to the new tax on
distributions of income trusts and other specified investment flow-through
entities as of 2011, reducing the tax rate in 2011 to 29.5% and in 2012 to
28.0%. These rates include a deemed provincial rate of 13%.
	    The Fund has approximately $1.8 billion in tax pools and deductions at
December 31, 2008, which can be used to reduce the amount of taxes paid by
Advantage. The Fund and Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. ("AOG") had the following
estimated tax pools in place at December 31, 2008:

	    Advantage experienced a net loss for the three months and year ended
December 31, 2008 primarily due to a $120.3 million impairment of goodwill.
Excluding this one-time non-cash item, Advantage had net income of $99.7
million for 2008, delivering significant financial results. For the full year,
we experienced considerably higher revenues from increased production and
average commodity prices. This was partially offset by some higher expenses,
including operating costs, depletion and depreciation. Although overall
Advantage had a successful year, the fourth quarter began to show strains from
the sudden drop in commodity prices that reduced revenues and negatively
impacted net income. Commodity prices have continued to worsen in 2009,
presenting a significant challenge for the entire oil and gas industry. We
expect this situation to have a wide-ranging impact on the sector for the
coming year. Net loss for the quarter and year also included unrealized
derivative gains of $34.0 million and $38.8 million, respectively, from the
low commodity price environment (see "Commodity Price Risk" section). The
unrealized amounts are not cash and the actual gains or losses realized on
eventual cash settlement can vary materially due to subsequent fluctuations in
commodity prices. The Fund does not apply hedge accounting and current
accounting standards require changes in the fair value to be included in the
consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss as an unrealized
derivative gain or loss with a corresponding derivative asset and liability
recorded on the balance sheet. These derivative contracts currently
outstanding will settle from January 2009 to March 2011 corresponding to when
Advantage will receive revenues from production.

	    Funds from operations and cash netbacks increased in total and per boe
for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due primarily to
additional production from the Sound acquisition and higher average commodity
prices through the first three quarters of 2008. Increased cash netbacks per
boe for the year ended December 31, 2008 were partially offset by realized
losses on derivatives, and increased operating expenses and royalties.
Realized hedging losses resulted from the higher commodity price environment
as the Fund entered derivative contracts to lessen commodity price
fluctuations, which can positively or negatively impact cash flows. Operating
costs increased during 2008 due to significantly higher field costs associated
with a general industry escalation and higher relative operating costs from
the Sound acquisition. Royalties also increased as would be expected since
they are generally based on current commodity prices. Funds from operations
and cash netbacks per boe for the three months ended December 31, 2008
decreased from the same period of 2007, a direct result of the commodity price
drops that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the financial crisis
deepened into a global recession. The decrease in commodity prices was
significantly offset by realized gains on derivatives during the period.
Operating costs per boe were higher for the three months ended December 31,
2008 due to early cold weather conditions that increased some operating costs
and lowered corresponding production volumes. However, we expect to see some
easing of operating costs in 2009 as the poor economic environment continues
to have an impact on the service sector.

	    Contractual Obligations and Commitments

	    The Fund has contractual obligations in the normal course of operations
including purchases of assets and services, operating agreements,
transportation commitments, sales contracts and convertible debentures. These
obligations are of a recurring and consistent nature and impact cash flow in
an ongoing manner. The following table is a summary of the Fund's remaining
contractual obligations and commitments. Advantage has no guarantees or
off-balance sheet arrangements other than as disclosed.

	        convertible to Trust Units based on an established conversion price.

	        for a further 364 day revolving period at the option of the
	        syndicate. If not extended, the revolving credit facility is

	    Advantage monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments according
to market conditions in an effort to meet its objectives given the current
outlook of the business and industry in general. The capital structure of the
Fund is composed of working capital (excluding derivative assets and
liabilities), bank indebtedness, convertible debentures, capital lease
obligations and Unitholders' equity. Advantage may manage its capital
structure by issuing new Trust Units, obtaining additional financing either
through bank indebtedness or convertible debenture issuances, refinancing
current debt, issuing other financial or equity-based instruments, adjusting
or discontinuing the amount of monthly distributions, suspending or renewing
its distribution reinvestment plan, adjusting capital spending, or disposing
of assets. The capital structure is reviewed by Management and the Board of
Directors on an ongoing basis.
	    In late 2008, a financial crisis materialized which has now turned into a
full global recession. This situation has significantly impacted the ability
to raise capital. Despite this situation, the Fund continues to generate funds
from operations sufficient to fund our operations and a reduced capital
program. Management of the Fund's capital structure is facilitated through its
financial and operational forecasting processes. The forecast of the Fund's
future cash flows is based on estimates of production, commodity prices,
forecast capital and operating expenditures, and other investing and financing
activities. The forecast is regularly updated based on new commodity prices
and other changes, which the Fund views as critical in the current
environment. Selected forecast information is frequently provided to the Board
of Directors. This continual financial assessment process further enables the
Fund to mitigate risks. The Fund continues to satisfy all liabilities and
commitments as they come due. We have an established $710 million credit
facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions; the balance of
which utilized at December 31, 2008 was $587 million. This facility will be
subject for renewal again in June 2009. The Fund additionally has several
convertible debentures that will mature in 2009, whereby we have the option to
settle such obligations by cash or though the issuance of Trust Units.
Management has budgeted for a capital program of $100 to $130 million for
fiscal 2009, as it is important to bring on additional production to offset
natural reserve declines and to grow the Fund. Management has significantly
reduced the capital program from 2008 and will continually monitor our capital
expenditures and make adjustments as needed in order to remain self-sufficient
within our funds from operations through the foreseeable future.
	    The current economic situation has also placed additional pressure on
commodity prices. Crude oil has dropped from a historic high to approximately
US$47/bbl. The impact from the decrease in WTI will be somewhat mitigated for
Advantage due to the strengthening US dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.
Natural gas prices that had been improving early in 2008, have now started to
decline due to the ailing economy as well as increased inventory levels from
strong injections and mild weather. Natural gas has dropped to approximately
CAD$3.80/GJ. The net effect for the Fund from prolonged weak commodity prices
would be reductions in operating netbacks and funds from operations.
Management has partially mitigated this risk through our commodity hedging
program but the lower commodity price environment has still had a significant
negative impact. In order to strengthen our financial position and balance our
cash flows, the monthly distribution has been discontinued to repay debt and
focus capital spending on our Montney natural gas resource play.
	    To summarize, we have implemented a strategy to maximize self sufficiency
such that funds from operations will satisfy our capital program, reduce debt,
and meet other expenditure requirements. We do not anticipate any problems
satisfying obligations as they become due. A successful hedging program was
also executed to help protect our funds from operations. As a result, we feel
that Advantage has implemented adequate strategies to protect our business as
much as possible in this environment. However, as with all companies, we are
still exposed to risks as a result of the current economic situation and the
potential duration. We continue to closely monitor the possible impact on our
business and strategy, and will make adjustments as necessary with prudent
management.

	    Unitholders' Equity and Convertible Debentures

	    Advantage has utilized a combination of Trust Units, convertible
debentures and bank debt to finance acquisitions and development activities.
	    As at December 31, 2008, the Fund had 142.8 million Trust Units
outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2008, 4,414,830 Trust Units
were issued as a result of the Premium Distribution(TM), Distribution
Reinvestment and Optional Trust Unit Purchase Plan (the "Plan"), generating
$39.9 million reinvested in the Fund and representing an approximate 20%
participation rate (for the year ended December 31, 2007, 4,028,252 Trust
Units were issued under the Plan, generating $46.7 million reinvested in the
Fund and representing an approximate 18% participation rate). As at March 18,
2009, Advantage had 145.2 million Trust Units issued and outstanding.
	    At December 31, 2008, the Fund had $219.2 million convertible debentures
outstanding that were immediately convertible to 9.5 million Trust Units based
on the applicable conversion prices (December 31, 2007 - $224.6 million
outstanding and convertible to 9.8 million Trust Units). During the year ended
December 31, 2008, $25,000 debentures were converted resulting in the issuance
of 1,001 Trust Units and the 9.00% debentures matured on August 1, 2008,
resulting in a cash payment of $5,392,000 to the debenture holders. As at
March 18, 2009, the Fund had $214.3 million convertible debentures
outstanding, after the remaining $4.9 million 8.25% debentures matured on
February 1, 2009 and were settled through the issuance of 946,887 Trust Units.
We have $29.8 million of 8.75% debentures that will mature on June 30, 2009
and $52.3 million of 7.50% debentures that mature on October 1, 2009. These
obligations can be settled through the payment of cash or issuance of Trust
Units at Advantage's option.
	    Advantage has a Trust Units Rights Incentive Plan for external directors
as approved by the Unitholders of the Fund. A total of 500,000 Trust Units
were reserved for issuance under the plan with an aggregate of 400,000 rights
granted since inception. The initial exercise price of rights granted under
the plan may not be less than the current market price of the Trust Units as
of the date of the grant and the maximum term of each right is not to exceed
ten years with all rights vesting immediately upon grant. At the option of the
rights holder, the exercise price of the rights can be adjusted downwards over
time based upon distributions paid by the Fund to Unitholders. In 2008, all
remaining 150,000 outstanding rights were exercised at $8.60 per right for
total cash proceeds of $1,290,000. No Trust Unit Rights were outstanding as of
December 31, 2008.
	    As a result of the SIFT tax legislation, an income trust is permitted to
double its market capitalization as it stands on October 31, 2006 by growing a
maximum of 40% in 2007 and 20% for the years 2008 to 2010. Any unused
expansion from the prior year can be brought forward into the following year
until the new tax rules take effect. In addition, an income trust may replace
debt that was outstanding as of October 31, 2006 with new equity or issue new,
non-convertible debt without affecting the normal growth percentage.  An
income trust may also merge with another income trust without a change to
their normal growth percentage, provided there is no net addition to equity as
a result of the merger. As a result of the "normal growth" guidelines, the
Fund is permitted to issue approximately $2.3 billion of new equity from
January 1, 2009 to January 1, 2011, which we believe is adequate for any
growth we expect to incur.
	    On January 20, 2009, the Fund adopted a Unitholder Rights Agreement (the
"Agreement") for which Unitholder approval will be sought at the Fund's next
annual meeting of Unitholders. Under the terms of the Agreement, Unitholders
will be granted one right per unit. Each right entitles the holder to purchase
a Trust Unit from treasury at a specified exercise price in the event of an
unsolicited take-over bid for the Fund. The purpose of the Agreement is to
allow Unitholders and the Board adequate time to consider and evaluate any
unsolicited bid made for the Fund, to provide the Board with adequate time to
identify, develop and negotiate value-enhancing alternatives, if considered
appropriate, to any such unsolicited bid, to encourage the fair treatment of
Unitholders in connection with any take-over bid for the Fund and to ensure
that any proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Unitholders of
the Fund. The Agreement is similar to other rights plans adopted by many
Canadian income trusts and corporations. The Rights Plan is not triggered if
an offer to acquire Fund Trust Units is made as a "permited bid" and thereby
allows sufficient time for the Board and Unitholders to consider and react to
the offer.

	    Bank Indebtedness, Credit Facility and Other Obligations

	    At December 31, 2008, Advantage had bank indebtedness outstanding of
$587.4 million. The Fund has a $710 million credit facility agreement
consisting of a $690 million extendible revolving loan facility and a $20
million operating loan facility. The current credit facilities are
collateralized by a $1 billion floating charge demand debenture, a general
security agreement and a subordination agreement from the Fund covering all
assets and cash flows. As well, the borrowing base for the Fund's credit
facilities is determined through utilizing our regular reserve estimates. The
banking syndicate thoroughly evaluates the reserve estimates based upon their
own commodity price expectations to determine the amount of the borrowing
base. Revision or changes in the reserve estimates and commodity prices can
have either a positive or a negative impact on the borrowing base of the Fund.
 In June 2008, the Fund renewed its credit facilities for a further year with
the next annual review scheduled to occur in June 2009. There can be no
assurances that the $710 million credit facility will be renewed at the
current borrowing base level given the present commodity price environment.
On March 18, 2009, we announced our intention to dispose of certain assets.
The net proceeds from these sales or other oil and natural gas property sales
will initially be used to reduce our outstanding bank debt to improve
Advantage's financial flexibility.
	    Advantage had a working capital deficiency of $146.4 million as at
December 31, 2008. Our working capital includes items expected for normal
operations such as trade receivables, prepaids, deposits, trade payables and
accruals as well as the current portion of capital lease obligations. Working
capital varies primarily due to the timing of such items, the current level of
business activity including our capital program, commodity price volatility,
and seasonal fluctuations. We do not anticipate any problems in meeting future
obligations as they become due given the strength of our funds from
operations. It is also important to note that working capital is effectively
integrated with Advantage's operating credit facility, which assists with the
timing of cash flows as required. The increase in our working capital
deficiency at December 31, 2008 is due to the additional inclusion of $87
million in principal amount of convertible debentures that mature during 2009
and are classified as a current liability. The $4.9 million principal amount
8.25% debentures matured on February 1, 2009 and were settled through the
issuance of 946,887 Trust Units. We have $29.8 million of 8.75% debentures
that will mature on June 30, 2009 and $52.3 million of 7.50% debentures that
mature on October 1, 2009. These obligations can be settled through the
payment of cash or issuance of Trust Units at Advantage's option.
	    Advantage has capital lease obligations on various pieces of equipment
used in its operations. The total amount of principal obligation outstanding
at December 31, 2008 is $5.7 million, bearing interest at effective rates
ranging from 5.5% to 6.7%, and is collateralized by the related equipment. The
leases expire at dates ranging from December 2009 to August 2010.

	    Advantage's growth strategy has been to acquire properties in or near
areas where we have large land positions, shallow to medium depth drilling
opportunities, and a balance of year round access. We focus on areas where
past activity has yielded long-life reserves with high cash netbacks.
Advantage is very well positioned to selectively exploit the highest
value-generating drilling opportunities given the size, strength and diversity
of our asset base. As a result, the Fund has a high level of flexibility to
distribute its capital program and ensure a risk-balanced platform of
projects. Our preference is to operate a high percentage of our properties
such that we can maintain control of capital expenditures, operations and cash
flows.
	    For the three month period ended December 31, 2008, the Fund spent a net
$99.3 million. Total capital spending in the quarter included $66.4 million at
Glacier, $9.4 million at Nevis, $5.8 million at Willesden Green, and $1.6
million at Chip Lake. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund spent a
net $255.6 million and drilled a total of 86.8 net (124 gross) wells at a 99%
success rate. Total capital spending for the year included $101.7 million at
Glacier, $49.6 million at Nevis, $17.2 million at Martin Creek, $15.1 million
at Willesden, $9.4 million at Sousa, and $8.1 million at Chip Lake.
	    During 2008, we commenced a significant development drilling program on
our Montney natural gas resource play in Glacier, Alberta. Our investment at
Glacier considerably increased reserves and confirmed horizontal well rates of
2.5 to 7.5 mmcf/d (417 to 1,250 boe/d). At Nevis, continued light oil drilling
in the Wabamun formation extended the field and resulted in numerous wells
with initial production exceeding 200 boe/day. A 35 gross (27 net) well
Horseshoe Canyon coal bed methane drilling program in 2008 also confirmed
several more phases of future drilling. At Nevis, a total of 47 gross (38.8
net) wells were drilled at a 100% success rate and added 2,980 boe/day of
initial production. At Martin Creek, our successful 10 well gross (8 net)
drilling program in early 2008 added 1,490 boe/day of initial production. At
Willesden Green, a new light oil pool was discovered with the drilling of 2
gross (2 net) wells with initial combined production of 800 boe/day. In
addition, 3 gross (3 net) wells were successfully drilled for liquids rich
natural gas production from the Rock Creek formation. At Northville, Brazeau
and Youngstown, 6 gross (4.3 net) wells were successfully drilled adding
additional reserves and defined additional drilling locations.
	    Property acquisitions year to date include a $7.6 million property
acquisition closed in the third quarter which increased our working interest
ownership and drilling inventory in the Horseshoe Canyon coal bed methane
lands at Nevis.
	    On December 18, 2008, the Board approved budgeted capital expenditures
for 2009 in the range of $100 to $130 million. This is down from 2008 as we
feel a conservative approach is appropriate in the current economic climate,
where commodity prices are depressed and available financing is limited. The
capital spending will be primarily directed towards drilling, infrastructure
and strategic investments in our Montney natural gas resource play at Glacier
in Northwest Alberta. We will continue to evaluate and adjust our 2009 capital
program as the year progresses.

	    The Fund generated higher funds from operations during 2008 compared to
2007 due to higher production levels and a stronger average commodity price
environment that prevailed through the first three quarters of the year. As a
result, the Fund was able to adequately finance its capital expenditures and
distributions to Unitholders. However, given the current economy and its
effects on commodity prices, our bank indebtedness increased during the fourth
quarter as a source of funds. We have been proactive in balancing our cash
flows and reduced our distribution in December 2008 followed by a further
reduction in January 2009 as commodity prices continued to erode. On March 18,
2009, we announced that our monthly distribution will be discontinued and
future cash flow redirect to repay debt and focus capital on our Montney
natural gas resource play. We will be closely monitoring our future sources
and uses of funds.

	    The table above highlights the Fund's performance for the fourth quarter
of 2008 and also for the preceding seven quarters. Production during the
2006/2007 winter was steady until we experienced a decrease in the second
quarter of 2007 due to several facility turnarounds at that time. The Sound
acquisition closed on September 5, 2007, and significantly increased
production for the third and fourth quarters of 2007. Production has gradually
decreased through the first half of 2008 due to natural declines, wet and cold
weather delays, and facility turnarounds. Production increased modestly in the
third quarter of 2008 as new wells were brought on production and most
facility turnarounds were completed. During the fourth quarter, production
again decreased as we experienced freezing conditions from early cold weather
as well as an extended third party facility outage. Financial results,
particularly revenues and funds from operations, have increased through to the
second quarter of 2008, as both commodity prices and production steadily
increased over that timeframe. However, revenues and funds from operations
slightly declined in the third quarter of 2008, as commodity prices began to
decline in response to the financial crisis that materialized in the fall of
2008. This trend worsened in the fourth quarter, as a full global recession
set in, and commodity prices continued on a downward trend. We experienced a
net loss in the third quarter of 2007 due to a significant drop in natural gas
prices realized at that time, amortization of the management internalization
consideration and increased depletion and depreciation expense. Net income
increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to the full integration of the
Sound acquisition and moderately improved commodity prices. Net losses were
realized in the first and second quarters of 2008, primarily as a result of
significant unrealized losses on commodity derivative contracts for future
periods. Commodity price declines in the third quarter of 2008 gave rise to
significant unrealized gains on these same derivative contracts, and in turn
the Fund reported record high net income. We recognized a considerable net
loss in the fourth quarter of 2008, a combined result of falling commodity
prices and an impairment of our entire goodwill.

	    Critical Accounting Estimates

	    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires
Management to make certain judgments and estimates. Changes in these judgments
and estimates could have a material impact on the Fund's financial results and
financial condition.
	    Management relies on the estimate of reserves as prepared by the Fund's
independent qualified reserves evaluator. The process of estimating reserves
is critical to several accounting estimates. The process of estimating
reserves is complex and requires significant judgments and decisions based on
available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. These
estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development
and production activities becomes available and as economic conditions impact
crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, royalty burden changes, and
future development costs. Reserve estimates impact net income through
depletion and depreciation of fixed assets, the provision for asset retirement
costs and related accretion expense, and impairment calculations for fixed
assets and goodwill. The reserve estimates are also used to assess the
borrowing base for the Fund's credit facilities. Revision or changes in the
reserve estimates can have either a positive or a negative impact on net
income and the borrowing base of the Fund.
	    Management's process of determining the provision for future income
taxes, the provision for asset retirement obligation costs and related
accretion expense, and the fair values assigned to any acquired company's
assets and liabilities in a business combination is based on estimates. These
estimates are significant and can include reserves, future production rates,
future crude oil and natural gas prices, future costs, future interest rates,
future tax rates and other relevant assumptions. Revisions or changes in any
of these estimates can have either a positive or a negative impact on asset
and liability values and net income.
	    In accordance with GAAP, derivative assets and liabilities are recorded
at their fair values at the reporting date, with unrealized gains and losses
recognized directly into net income and comprehensive income in the same
period. The fair value of derivatives outstanding is an estimate based on
pricing models, estimates, assumptions and market data available at that time.
As such, the unrealized amounts are not cash and the actual gains or losses
realized on eventual cash settlement can vary materially due to subsequent
fluctuations in commodity prices as compared to the valuation assumptions.

	    International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS")

	    In February 2008, the Accounting Standards Board of the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants confirmed that publicly accountable
entities will be required to adopt IFRS effective January 1, 2011, including
preparation of comparative financial information. Management has engaged its
key personnel responsible for financial reporting and developed an overall
plan to address IFRS implementation. The initial stage of the plan involved
staff training and ongoing education. Key personnel received professional
education on IFRS accounting principles and standards, both in general and for
the oil and gas industry in particular. Review of changes to IFRS has been
incorporated into existing processes of internal control over financial
reporting. A preliminary project plan for IFRS implementation has been drafted
and will be subject to ongoing revision as there are developments. As well,
appropriate operating personnel have been engaged, as necessary, to determine
how to implement the requirements of IFRS into the Fund's manual and
information systems that collect and process financial data. We expect to have
continual discussion with our external auditors throughout the process
regarding IFRS and implementation.
	    The most significant change identified will be accounting for property,
plant and equipment. The Fund, like many Canadian oil and gas reporting
issuers, applies the "full cost" concept in accounting for its oil and gas
assets. Under full cost, capital expenditures are maintained in a single cost
centre for each country, and the cost centre is subject to a single depletion
calculation and impairment test. IFRS will require the Fund to make a much
more detailed assessment of its oil and gas property, plant and equipment. For
depletion and depreciation, the Fund must identify asset components, and
determine an appropriate depreciation or depletion method for each component.
With regards to impairment calculation purposes, we must be identify "Cash
Generating Units", which are defined as the smallest group of assets that
produces independent cash flows. An impairment test must be performed
individually for all cash generating units. The recognition of impairments in
a prior year can be reversed subsequently depending on such calculations. It
is also important to note that the International Accounting Standards Board
("IASB") is currently undertaking an extractive industries project, to develop
accounting standards specifically for businesses like that of the Fund.
However, the project will not be complete prior to IFRS adoption in Canada. We
have also identified a number of other areas whereby differences between
Canadian GAAP and IFRS are likely to exist for Advantage. However, currently
we are concentrating on the accounting for property, plant and equipment and
will evaluate these other areas in due course and develop more detailed plans
to address the identified issues.

	    Controls and Procedures

	    The Fund has established procedures and internal control systems to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Management of the Fund is committed to providing timely,
accurate and balanced disclosure of all material information about the Fund.
Disclosure controls and procedures are in place to ensure all ongoing
reporting requirements are met and material information is disclosed on a
timely basis. The Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial
Officer, individually, sign certifications that the financial statements,
together with the other financial information included in the regular filings,
fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented in
the filings. The certifications further acknowledge that the filings do not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated or that is necessary to make a statement not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which it was made, with respect
to the period covered by the filings.

	    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	    The Fund has established a Disclosure Committee consisting of the
executive members with the responsibility of overseeing the Fund's disclosure
practices and designing disclosure controls and procedures ("DCP"), as such
term is defined in National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in
Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings, to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the Fund in its annual filings,
interim filings or other reports filed or submitted by the Fund under
applicable securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in applicable securities
legislation and that all material information relating to the Fund is made
known to them by others, particularly during the period in which the Fund's
annual and interim filings are being prepared. All written public disclosures
are reviewed and approved by at least one member of the Disclosure Committee
prior to issuance. Additionally, the Disclosure Committee assists the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Fund in making
certifications with respect to the disclosure controls of the Fund required
under applicable regulations and ensures that the Board of Directors is
promptly and fully informed regarding potential disclosure issues facing the
Fund.
	    The Fund's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting ("ICFR"), as such term is
defined in National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers'
Annual and Interim Filings. Management of Advantage, including our Chief
Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2008. Based on that evaluation, Management has
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the
end of the period, in all material respects. It should be noted that while the
Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer believe that
the Fund's design of disclosure controls and procedures provide a reasonable
level of assurance that they are effective, they do not expect that the
disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system does not provide
absolute, but rather is designed to provide reasonable, assurance that the
objective of the control system is met.

	    Management's Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

	    The Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. The Fund's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed, under the supervision and with the
participation of executive and financial officers of the Fund, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the Fund's financial statements for external reporting purposes
in accordance with GAAP.
	    The Fund's internal control over financial reporting includes policies
and procedures that: 1. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions
of assets of the Fund; 2. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP; and 3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
	    The Fund's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect all misstatements because of inherent limitations. Additionally,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the Fund's
policies and procedures.
	    The Fund's management assessed the design and effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this assessment, management concluded that the Fund maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.
	    During the year ended December 31, 2008, there has been no change in the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting.

	    Corporate Governance

	    The Board of Directors' mandate is to supervise the management of the
business and affairs of the Fund including the business and affairs of the
Fund delegated to AOG. In particular, all decisions relating to: (i) the
acquisition and disposition of properties for a purchase price or proceeds in
excess of $5 million; (ii) the approval of annual operating and capital
expenditure budgets; and (iii) the establishment of credit facilities and the
issuance of additional Trust Units, will be made by the Board.
	    Computershare Trust Company of Canada, the Trustee of the Fund, has
delegated certain matters to the Board of Directors. These include all
decisions relating to issuance of additional Trust Units and the determination
of the amount of distributions. Any amendment to any material contract to
which the Fund is a party will require the approval of the Board of Directors
and, in some cases, Unitholder approval.
	    The Board of Directors meets regularly to review the business and affairs
of the Fund and AOG and to make any required decisions. The Board of Directors
consists of eleven members, eight of whom are unrelated to the Fund. The
Independent Reserve Evaluation Committee has four members, the Audit Committee
has five members, and the Human Resources, Compensation and Corporate
Governance Committee has four members. All members of the various committees
are independent. One member of the Audit Committee has been designated a
"Financial Expert" as defined in applicable regulatory guidance. In addition,
the Chairman of the Board is not related and is not an executive officer of
the Fund.
	    The Board of Directors approved and Management implemented a Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics. The purpose of the code is to lay out the
expectation for the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct from
our directors, officers and employees. The code reflects our commitment to a
culture of honesty, integrity and accountability and outlines the basic
principles and policies with which all employees are expected to comply. Our
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at
www.advantageincome.com.
	    As a Canadian issuer listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"),
Advantage is not required to comply with most of the NYSE rules and listing
standards and instead may comply with domestic requirements. As a foreign
private issuer, Advantage is only required to comply with four of the NYSE
Rules: (i) have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of the
United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii) the Chief Executive
Officer must promptly notify the NYSE in writing after an executive officer
becomes aware of any material non-compliance with the applicable NYSE Rules;
(iii) submit an executed annual written affirmation, as well as an interim
affirmation each time a change occurs to the audit committee; and (iv) provide
a brief description of any significant differences between its corporate
governance practices and those followed by U.S. companies listed under the
NYSE. Advantage has reviewed the NYSE listing standards and confirms that its
corporate governance practices do not differ significantly from such
standards.
	    A further discussion of the Fund's corporate governance practices can be
found in the Management Proxy Circular.

	    Outlook

	    The Fund's 2009 budget, as approved by the Board of Directors, is
tailored to the current economic climate. Our natural gas resource play at
Montney in Glacier, Northwest Alberta will be the largest area of focus. We
reiterate that these are extremely uncertain times. Although the 2009 budget
incorporates flexibility in its current form, management and the Board will
review the budget continually, and adapt when necessary. Advantage's 2009
capital expenditures budget is estimated to be approximately $100 to $130
million. Capital spending is estimated to be allocated 46% to Montney, and 54%
to other core areas. Given the low commodity price environment and increasing
concerns with the economy, Advantage will target 2009 capital expenditures at
the lower end of our guidance range.
	    On March 18, 2009, we announced the intention to dispose of properties
producing up to 11,300 boe/d of light oil and natural gas properties located
in Northeast British Columbia, West Central Alberta and Northern Alberta. The
net proceeds from these sales or other oil and natural gas property sales will
initially be used to reduce outstanding bank debt to improve Advantage's
financial flexibility. Proposals are anticipated by mid May 2009 and the
selected assets will be available in four distinct packages varying in size
from approximately 1,600 to 5,400 boe/d of production. Assuming asset sales of
approximately 10,000 to 11,300 boe/d of production are completed, we expect
production of approximately 20,000 to 22,000 boe/d from a focused asset base
(60% natural gas, 40% oil and natural gas liquids).
	    Industry supply, servicing and maintenance costs increased through the
first three quarters of 2008 driven primarily from higher crude oil and
natural gas prices. Also, there were significant increases from electrical
power costs, processing fees, steel and chemicals. We expect to see some
easing of operating costs as the lower commodity price environment is expected
to remain for a sustained period. Per unit operating costs on an annual basis
are expected to range between the $13.95 to $14.45/boe in 2009; however, this
will be impacted by the magnitude of our asset disposition program.
	    Advantage's funds from operations in 2009 will continue to be impacted by
the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices and the $US/$Canadian
exchange rate. Additional hedging has been completed for 2009 and 2010 to
stabilize cash flows and ensure that the Fund's capital program is fully
funded. Approximately 56% of our natural gas production, net of royalties, is
now hedged for the 2009 calendar year at an average fixed price of $8.09/mcf.
Advantage has also hedged 46% of its 2009 crude oil production, net of
royalties, at an average floor price of $69.38/bbl. For 2010, we have hedged
48% of our natural gas production, net of royalties, at an average fixed price
of $7.46/mcf and 26% of our crude oil production, net of royalties, at an
average fixed price of $67.83/bbl.
	    Advantage will continue to focus on low cost production and reserve
additions through low to medium risk development drilling opportunities that
have arisen as a result of the acquisitions completed in prior years and from
the significant inventory of drilling opportunities that has resulted from the
Ketch and Sound mergers. Our total drilling inventory in our Glacier Montney
natural gas resource play has grown to over 440 confirmed drilling locations
and we have significant additional conventional drilling locations.
	    Looking forward, Advantage's high quality assets combined with a
significant unconventional and conventional inventory, strong hedging program
and excellent tax pools provides many options for the Fund to maximize value
generation for our Unitholders.

	    Sensitivities

	    The following table displays the current estimated sensitivity on funds
from operations and funds from operations per Trust Unit to changes in
production, commodity prices, exchange rates and interest rates for 2009

	    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	    December 31, 2008

	    All tabular amounts in thousands except as otherwise indicated.

	    1.  Business and Structure of the Fund

	        Advantage Energy Income Fund ("Advantage" or the "Fund") was formed
	        on May 23, 2001 as a result of a plan of arrangement. For Canadian
	        tax purposes, Advantage is an open-ended unincorporated mutual fund
	        trust created under the laws of the Province of Alberta pursuant to a
	        Trust Indenture originally dated April 17, 2001, and as occasionally
	        amended, between Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. ("AOG") and Computershare
	        Trust Company of Canada, as trustee. The Fund commenced operations on
	        May 24, 2001. The beneficiaries of the Fund are the holders of the
	        Trust Units (the "Unitholders").

	        The principal undertaking of the Fund is to indirectly acquire and
	        hold interests in petroleum and natural gas properties and assets
	        related thereto. The business of the Fund is carried on by its
	        wholly-owned subsidiary, AOG. The Fund's primary assets are currently
	        the common shares of AOG, a royalty in the producing properties of
	        AOG (the "AOG Royalty") and notes of AOG (the "AOG Notes"). The
	        Fund's strategy, through AOG, is to minimize exposure to exploration
	        risk while focusing on growth through acquisitions and development of
	        producing crude oil and natural gas properties.

	        The purpose of the Fund is to distribute available cash flow to
	        Unitholders on a monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the
	        Trust Indenture. The Fund's available cash flow includes principal
	        repayments and interest income earned from the AOG Notes, royalty
	        income earned from the AOG Royalty, and any dividends declared on the
	        common shares of AOG less any expenses of the Fund including interest
	        on convertible debentures. Cash received on the AOG Notes, AOG
	        Royalty and common shares of AOG result in the effective transfer of
	        the economic interest in the properties of AOG to the Fund. However,
	        while the royalty is a contractual interest in the properties owned
	        by AOG, it does not confer ownership in the underlying resource
	        properties. Distributions from the Fund to Unitholders are entirely
	        discretionary and are determined by Management and the Board of
	        Directors. We closely monitor our distribution policy considering
	        forecasted cash flows, optimal debt levels, capital spending
	        activity, taxability to Unitholders, working capital requirements,
	        and other potential cash expenditures. Distributions are announced
	        monthly and are based on the cash available after retaining a portion
	        to meet such spending requirements. The level of distributions are
	        primarily determined by cash flows received from the production of
	        oil and natural gas from existing Canadian resource properties and
	        are highly dependent upon our success in exploiting the current
	        reserve base and acquiring additional reserves. Furthermore, monthly
	        distributions we pay to Unitholders are highly dependent upon the
	        prices received for such oil and natural gas production.

	        On March 18, 2009, Advantage announced its intention to convert to a
	        growth oriented corporation and has discontinued the payment of
	        distributions to focus on debt repayment and developing the Montney
	        natural gas resource play (note 17).

	    2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

	        The Management of the Fund prepares its consolidated financial
	        statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
	        principles ("Canadian GAAP") and all amounts are stated in Canadian
	        dollars. The preparation of consolidated financial statements
	        requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	        reported amount of assets, liabilities and equity and disclosures of
	        contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements
	        and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
	        The following significant accounting policies are presented to assist
	        the reader in evaluating these consolidated financial statements and,
	        together with the notes, should be considered an integral part of the
	        consolidated financial statements.

	        (a) Consolidation and joint operations

	        These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
	        Fund and all subsidiaries, including AOG. All intercompany balances
	        and transactions have been eliminated.

	        The Fund conducts exploration and production activities jointly with
	        other participants. The accounts of the Fund reflect its
	        proportionate interest in such joint operations.

	        (b) Fixed assets

	            (i) Petroleum and natural gas properties

	            The Fund follows the "full cost" method of accounting in
	            accordance with the guideline issued by the Canadian Institute of
	            Chartered Accountants ("CICA") whereby all costs associated with
	            the acquisition of and the exploration for and development of
	            petroleum and natural gas reserves, whether productive or
	            unproductive, are capitalized in a Canadian cost centre and
	            charged to income as set out below. Such costs include lease
	            acquisition, drilling and completion, production facilities,
	            asset retirement costs, geological and geophysical costs and
	            overhead expenses related to exploration and development
	            activities.

	            Gains or losses are not recognized upon disposition of petroleum
	            and natural gas properties unless crediting the proceeds against
	            accumulated costs would result in a change in the rate of
	            depletion and depreciation of 20% or more.

	            Depletion of petroleum and natural gas properties and
	            depreciation of lease, well equipment and production facilities
	            is provided on accumulated costs using the "unit-of-production"
	            method based on estimated net proved petroleum and natural gas
	            reserves, before royalties, as determined by independent
	            engineers. For purposes of the depletion and depreciation
	            calculation, proved petroleum and natural gas reserves are
	            converted to a common unit-of-measure on the basis of one barrel
	            of oil or liquids being equal to six thousand cubic feet of
	            natural gas.

	            The depletion and depreciation cost base includes total
	            capitalized costs, less costs of unproved properties, plus a
	            provision for future development costs of proved undeveloped
	            reserves. Costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties
	            are excluded from depletion calculations until it is determined
	            whether or not proved reserves are attributable to the properties
	            or impairment occurs.

	            Petroleum and natural gas assets are evaluated in each reporting
	            period to determine that the carrying amount in a cost centre is
	            recoverable and does not exceed the fair value of the properties
	            in the cost centre (the "ceiling test"). The carrying amounts are
	            assessed to be recoverable when the sum of the undiscounted net
	            cash flows expected from the production of proved reserves, the
	            lower of cost and market of unproved properties and the cost of
	            major development projects exceeds the carrying amount of the
	            cost centre. When the carrying amount is not assessed to be
	            recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that
	            the carrying amount of the cost centre exceeds the sum of the
	            discounted net cash flows expected from the production of proved
	            and probable reserves, the lower of cost and market of unproved
	            properties and the cost of major development projects of the cost
	            centre. The net cash flows are estimated using expected future
	            product prices and costs and are discounted using a risk-free
	            interest rate. Under Canadian GAAP, there has been no impairment
	            of the Fund's petroleum and natural gas properties since
	            inception.

	            (ii) Furniture and equipment

	            The Fund records furniture and equipment at cost and provides
	            depreciation on the declining balance method at a rate of 20% per
	            annum which is designed to amortize the cost of the assets over
	            their estimated useful lives. The Fund records leasehold
	            improvements at cost and provides depreciation on the straight-
	            line method over the term of the lease.

	        (c) Goodwill

	        Goodwill is the excess purchase price of a business over the fair
	        value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is
	        stated at cost less impairment and is not amortized. Goodwill
	        impairment is assessed at year-end, or as economic events dictate, by
	        comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (the Fund) to its
	        carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the Fund is
	        less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is
	        recognized by allocating the fair value of the Fund to the
	        identifiable assets and liabilities as if the Fund had been acquired
	        in a business acquisition for a purchase price equal to the fair
	        value. The excess of the fair value of the Fund over the values
	        assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied
	        fair value of the goodwill. Any excess of the carrying value of the
	        goodwill over the implied fair value is the impairment amount and is
	        charged to income in the period incurred.

	        (d) Distributions

	        Distributions declared are calculated on an accrual basis.

	        (e) Financial instruments

	        The Fund's financial instruments consist of financial assets,
	        financial liabilities, and non-financial derivatives. All financial
	        instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the balance
	        sheet. Measurement of financial instruments subsequent to the initial
	        recognition, as well as resulting gains and losses, are recorded
	        based on how each financial instrument was initially classified. The
	        Fund has classified each identified financial instrument into the
	        following categories: held for trading, loans and receivables, held
	        to maturity investments, available for sale financial assets, and
	        other financial liabilities. Held for trading financial instruments
	        are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in
	        earnings immediately. Available for sale financial assets are
	        measured at fair value with gains and losses, other than impairment
	        losses, recognized in other comprehensive income and transferred to
	        earnings when the asset is derecognized. Loans and receivables, held
	        to maturity investments and other financial liabilities are
	        recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method and
	        impairment losses are recorded in earnings when incurred. With all
	        new financial instruments, an election is available that allows
	        entities to classify any financial instrument as held for trading.
	        Only those financial assets and liabilities that must be classified
	        as held for trading are classified as such by the Fund.

	        As the Fund frequently uses non-financial derivative instruments to
	        manage market risk associated with volatile commodity prices, such
	        instruments must be classified as held for trading and recorded on
	        the balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets and liabilities.
	        Under the alternative hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses on
	        derivatives classified as effective cash flow hedges are included in
	        other comprehensive income until the time at which the hedged item is
	        realized. The Fund does not utilize derivative instruments for
	        speculative purposes but has elected not to apply hedge accounting.
	        Therefore, gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as
	        unrealized gains and losses on derivatives in the consolidated
	        statement of loss, comprehensive loss and accumulated deficit in the
	        period they occur and as realized gains and losses on derivatives
	        when the contracts are settled. Since unrealized gains and losses on
	        derivatives are non-cash items, there is no impact on cash provided
	        by operating activities as a result of their recognition.

	        The Fund also evaluates whether any host contracts contain embedded
	        derivatives, and records them separately from the host contract when
	        their economic characteristics and risk are not clearly and closely
	        related to those of the host contract, the terms of the embedded
	        derivatives are the same as those of a freestanding derivative, and
	        the combined contract is not classified as held for trading or
	        designated at fair value. The Fund has not identified any embedded
	        derivatives that would require separation from the host contract and
	        fair value accounting.

	        Transaction costs are frequently attributed to the acquisition or
	        issue of a financial asset or liability. Such costs incurred on held
	        for trading financial instruments are expensed immediately. For other
	        financial instruments, an entity can adopt an accounting policy of
	        either expensing transaction costs as they occur or adding such
	        transaction costs to the fair value of the financial instrument. The
	        Fund has chosen a policy of adding transaction costs to the fair
	        value initially recognized for financial assets and liabilities that
	        are not classified as held for trading.

	        (f) Comprehensive income

	        Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive
	        income ("OCI") with amounts included in OCI shown net of tax.
	        Accumulated other comprehensive income is comprised of the cumulative
	        amounts of OCI. To date, the Fund does not have any adjustments in
	        OCI and therefore comprehensive income is currently equal to net
	        income.

	        (g) Convertible debentures

	        The Fund's convertible debentures are financial liabilities
	        consisting of a liability with an embedded conversion feature. As
	        such, the debentures are segregated between liabilities and equity
	        based on the relative fair market value of the liability and equity
	        portions. Therefore, the debenture liabilities are presented at less
	        than their eventual maturity values. The liability and equity
	        components are further reduced for issuance costs initially incurred.
	        The discount of the liability component as compared to maturity value
	        is accreted by the "effective interest" method over the debenture
	        term and expensed accordingly. As debentures are converted to Trust
	        Units, an appropriate portion of the liability and equity components
	        are transferred to Unitholders' capital.

	        (h) Asset retirement obligations

	        The Fund follows the "asset retirement obligation" method of
	        recording the future cost associated with removal, site restoration
	        and asset retirement costs. The fair value of the liability for the
	        Fund's asset retirement obligations is recorded in the period in
	        which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using the
	        Fund's credit adjusted risk-free interest rate and the corresponding
	        amount recognized by increasing the carrying amount of fixed assets.
	        The asset recorded is depleted on a "unit-of-production" basis over
	        the life of the reserves consistent with the Fund's depletion and
	        depreciation policy for petroleum and natural gas properties. The
	        liability amount is increased each reporting period due to the
	        passage of time and the amount of accretion is charged to income in
	        the period. Revisions to the estimated timing of cash flows or to the
	        original estimated undiscounted cost could also result in an increase
	        or decrease to the obligation. Actual costs incurred upon settlement
	        of the retirement obligations are charged against the obligation to
	        the extent of the liability recorded.

	        (i) Income taxes

	        The Fund is considered an open-ended unincorporated mutual fund trust
	        under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Any taxable income is allocated to
	        the Unitholders and therefore no provision for current income taxes
	        relating to the Fund is included in these financial statements.

	        The Fund and its subsidiaries follow the "liability" method of
	        accounting for future income taxes. Under this method future income
	        tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
	        between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax basis
	        using substantially enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply when
	        the differences reverse. The effect a change in income tax rates has
	        on future tax assets and liabilities is recognized in net income in
	        the period in which the change is substantively enacted.

	        (j) Unit-based compensation

	        Advantage accounts for compensation expense based on the "fair
	        value" of rights granted under its unit-based compensation plans. The
	        Fund has Trust Units held in escrow relating to the management
	        internalization (note 14), a unit-based compensation plan for
	        external directors of the Fund, and a Restricted Trust Unit Plan
	        (note 11).

	        The escrowed Trust Units relating to the management internalization
	        vest equally over three years, the period during which employees are
	        required to provide service to receive the Trust Units. Therefore,
	        the management internalization consideration is being deferred and
	        amortized into income as management internalization expense over the
	        specific vesting periods during which employee services are provided,
	        including an estimate of future Trust Unit forfeitures.

	        Awards under the external directors' unit-based compensation plan
	        vest immediately with associated compensation expense recognized in
	        the current period earnings and estimated forfeiture rates are not
	        incorporated in the determination of fair value. The compensation
	        expense results in the creation of contributed surplus until the
	        rights are exercised. Consideration paid upon the exercise of the
	        rights together with the amount previously recognized in contributed
	        surplus is recorded as an increase in Unitholders' capital.

	        Advantage's current employee compensation includes a Restricted Trust
	        Unit Plan (the "Plan"), as approved by the Unitholders on June 23,
	        2006, and Trust Units issuable for the retention of certain employees
	        of the Fund. The Plan authorizes the Board of Directors to grant
	        Restricted Trust Units ("RTUs") to directors, officers, or employees
	        of the Fund. The number of RTUs granted is based on the Fund's Trust
	        Unit return for a calendar year and compared to a peer group approved
	        by the Board of Directors. The Trust Unit return is calculated at the
	        end of the year and is primarily based on the year-over-year change
	        in the Trust Unit price plus distributions. If the Trust Unit return
	        for a year is positive, an RTU grant will be calculated based on the
	        return and market capitalization. If the Trust Unit return for a year
	        is negative, but the return is still within the top two-thirds of the
	        approved peer group performance, the Board of Directors may choose a
	        discretionary RTU grant. The RTU grants vest one third immediately on
	        grant date, with the remaining two thirds vesting evenly on the
	        following two yearly anniversary dates. The holders of RTUs may elect
	        to receive cash upon vesting in lieu of the number of Trust Units to
	        be issued, subject to consent of the Fund. Compensation cost related
	        to the Plan is recognized as compensation expense over the service
	        period and incorporates the Trust Unit grant price, the estimated
	        number of RTUs to vest, and certain management estimates. The maximum
	        amount of RTUs granted in any one calendar year is limited to 175% of
	        the base salaries of those individuals participating in the Plan for
	        such period.

	        (k) Revenue recognition

	        Revenue associated with the sale of crude oil, natural gas and
	        natural gas liquids is recognized when the title and risks pass to
	        the purchaser, normally at the pipeline delivery point for natural
	        gas and at the wellhead for crude oil.

	        (l) Per Trust Unit amounts

	        Net loss per Trust Unit is calculated using the weighted average
	        number of Trust Units outstanding during the year. Diluted net loss
	        per Trust Unit is calculated using the "if-converted" method to
	        determine the dilutive effect of convertible debentures and the
	        "treasury stock" method for trust unit rights granted to directors,
	        management internalization escrowed Trust Units and Restricted Trust
	        Units.

	        (m) Measurement uncertainty

	        The amounts recorded for depletion and depreciation of fixed assets,
	        the provision for asset retirement obligation costs and related
	        accretion expense, impairment calculations for fixed assets and
	        goodwill, derivative fair value calculations, future income tax
	        provisions, as well as fair values assigned to any identifiable
	        assets and liabilities in business combinations are based on
	        estimates. These estimates are significant and include proved and
	        probable reserves, future production rates, future crude oil and
	        natural gas prices, future costs, future interest rates, fair value
	        assessments, and other relevant assumptions. By their nature, these
	        estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on
	        the consolidated financial statements of changes in such estimates in
	        future years could be material.

	        (n) Capital disclosures

	        Effective January 1, 2008, the Fund adopted CICA Handbook Section
	        1535, Capital Disclosures. This Section establishes standards for
	        disclosing information about an entity's capital and how it is
	        managed to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the
	        entity's objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital.
	        The adoption of this Section requires that information on capital
	        management be included in the notes to the consolidated financial
	        statements (see note 15). This new standard does not have any effect
	        on the Fund's financial position or results of operations.

	        (o) Recent accounting pronouncements issued but not implemented

	            (i) Goodwill and intangible assets

	            In February 2008, the CICA issued Section 3064, Goodwill and
	            Intangible Assets, replacing Section 3062, Goodwill and Other
	            Intangible Assets and Section 3450, Research and Development
	            Costs. The new Section will become effective January 1, 2009.
	            Management has evaluated the new Section and there will be no
	            impact for the financial statements of the Fund.

	            (ii) International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS")

	            In February 2008, the CICA Accounting Standards Board confirmed
	            that IFRS will replace Canadian GAAP effective January 1, 2011
	            for publicly accountable enterprises. Management is currently
	            evaluating the effects of all current and pending pronouncements
	            of the International Accounting Standards Board on the financial
	            statements of the Fund, and has developed a plan for
	            implementation.

	        (p) Comparative figures

	        Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the
	        current year's presentation.

	    3.  Sound Energy Trust Acquisition

	        On September 5, 2007, Advantage acquired all of the issued and
	        outstanding Trust Units and Exchangeable Shares of Sound Energy Trust
	        ("Sound") for $21.4 million cash consideration, 16,977,184 Advantage
	        Trust Units and $0.9 million of acquisition costs. Sound Unitholders
	        and Exchangeable Shareholders elected to receive either 0.30
	        Advantage Trust Units for each Sound Trust Unit or $0.66 in cash and
	        0.2557 Advantage Trust Units for each Sound Trust Unit. All of the
	        Sound Exchangeable Shares were exchanged for Advantage Trust Units on
	        the same ratio as the Sound Trust Units based on the conversion ratio
	        in effect at the effective date of the acquisition. Sound was an
	        energy trust engaged in the development, acquisition and production
	        of natural gas and crude oil in western Canada. The acquisition was
	        accounted for using the "purchase method" with the results of
	        operations included in the consolidated financial statements as of
	        the closing date of the acquisition.

	        The purchase price has been allocated as follows:

	        Net assets acquired and             Consideration:
	         liabilities assumed:

	        Fixed assets           $ 514,060    16,977,184 Trust

	         obligations             (16,695)
	        Capital lease
	         obligations              (1,567)
	                              -----------
	                               $ 251,159
	                              -----------

	        The value of the Trust Units issued as consideration was determined
	        based on the weighted average trading value of Advantage Trust Units
	        during the two-day period before and after the terms of the
	        acquisition were agreed to and announced. The allocation of the
	        purchase price has been revised in 2008 due to the realization of
	        estimates. As a result, fixed assets increased $4.4 million, accounts
	        receivable increased $0.2 million, and accounts payable and accrued
	        liabilities increased $4.6 million.

	        During the year ended December 31, 2008, Advantage capitalized
	        general and administrative expenditures directly related to
	        exploration and development activities of $11,127,000
	        (2007 - $9,653,000).

	        Costs of $68,267,000 (2007 - $60,238,000) for unproved properties
	        have been excluded from the calculation of depletion expense, and
	        future development costs of $378,242,000 (2007 - $190,146,000) have
	        been included in costs subject to depletion.

	        The Fund performed a ceiling test calculation at December 31, 2008 to
	        assess the recoverable value of fixed assets. Based on the
	        calculation, the carrying amounts are recoverable as compared to the
	        sum of the undiscounted net cash flows expected from the production
	        of proved reserves based on the following benchmark prices:

	        by the Fund when performing the ceiling test calculation.

	    5.  Goodwill

	        The Fund frequently assesses goodwill impairment which is effectively
	        a comparison of the fair value of the Fund to the values assigned to
	        the identifiable assets and liabilities. The fair value of the Fund
	        is typically determined by reference to the market capitalization
	        adjusted for a number of potential valuation factors. The values of
	        the identifiable assets and liabilities include the current assessed
	        value of our reserves and other assets and liabilities. Near the end
	        of 2008, Advantage and the entire oil and gas industry, experienced a
	        substantial decline in market capitalization as a result of the
	        worldwide recession, resulting soft commodity prices, and general
	        negative market reaction. As a result, the entire balance of goodwill
	        was determined to be impaired at December 31, 2008, as there is no
	        market perception of goodwill.

	    6.  Capital Lease Obligations

	        The Fund has capital leases on a variety of fixed assets. Future
	        minimum lease payments at December 31, 2008 consist of the following:

	        ----------------------------------------------

	        During the second quarter of 2007, Advantage entered a new lease
	        arrangement that resulted in the recognition of a fixed asset
	        addition and capital lease obligation of $4.1 million. The lease
	        obligation bears interest at 5.8% and is secured by the related
	        equipment. The lease term expires June 2011 with a final purchase
	        obligation of $1.5 million at which time ownership of the equipment
	        will transfer to Advantage.

	        Effective September 4, 2007, Advantage entered a new lease
	        arrangement that resulted in the recognition of a fixed asset
	        addition and capital lease obligation of $1.8 million. The lease
	        obligation bears interest at 6.7% and is secured by the related
	        equipment. The lease term expires August 2010 with a final payment
	        obligation of $0.7 million. Distributions to Unitholders are not
	        permitted if the Fund is in default of such capital lease.

	        On September 5, 2007, Advantage assumed two capital lease obligations
	        in the acquisition of Sound (note 3) resulting in the recognition of
	        capital lease obligations of $1.6 million. Both of the lease
	        obligations bear interest at 5.6% and are secured by the related
	        equipment. The lease terms expire December 2009 and April 2010 with a
	        total final payment obligation of $0.9 million.

	        Fixed assets subject to capital leases are depreciated on a "unit-of-
	        production" basis over the life of the reserves consistent with the
	        Fund's depletion and depreciation policy for petroleum and natural
	        gas properties and is included in depletion, depreciation and
	        accretion expense.

	    7.  Convertible Debentures

	        The convertible unsecured subordinated debentures pay interest semi-
	        annually and are convertible at the option of the holder into Trust
	        Units of Advantage at the applicable conversion price per Trust Unit
	        plus accrued and unpaid interest. The details of the convertible
	        debentures including fair market values initially assigned and
	        issuance costs are as follows:

	        Due to the acquisition of Sound (note 3), 8.75% and 8.00% convertible
	        debentures were assumed by Advantage on September 5, 2007. As a
	        result of the change in control of Sound, the Fund was required by
	        the debenture indentures to make an offer to purchase all of the
	        outstanding convertible debentures assumed from Sound at a price
	        equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
	        interest. On October 17, 2007, the expiry date of the offer, 911,709
	        Trust Units were issued and $19.9 million in total cash consideration
	        was paid in exchange for $29,665,000 8.75% convertible debentures and
	        2,220,289 Trust Units were issued in exchange for $25,507,000 8.0%
	        convertible debentures.

	        During the year ended December 31, 2008, $25,000 debentures (2007 -
	        $24,000) were converted resulting in the issuance of 1,001 Trust
	        Units (2007 - 1,386 Trust Units).

	        The principal amount of 9.00% convertible debentures matured on
	        August 1, 2008 and the Fund settled the obligation by payment of $5.4
	        million in cash.

	    8.  Bank Indebtedness

	        Advantage has a credit facility agreement with a syndicate of
	        financial institutions which provides for a $690 million extendible
	        revolving loan facility and a $20 million operating loan facility.
	        The loan's interest rate is based on either prime, US base rate,
	        LIBOR or bankers' acceptance rates, at the Fund's option, subject to
	        certain basis point or stamping fee adjustments ranging from 0.00% to
	        1.50% depending on the Fund's debt to cash flow ratio. The credit
	        facilities are collateralized by a $1 billion floating charge demand
	        debenture, a general security agreement and a subordination agreement
	        from the Fund covering all assets and cash flows. The credit
	        facilities are subject to review on an annual basis with the next
	        renewal due in June 2009. Various borrowing options are available
	        under the credit facilities, including prime rate-based advances, US
	        base rate advances, US dollar LIBOR advances and bankers' acceptances
	        loans. The credit facilities constitute a revolving facility for a
	        364 day term which is extendible annually for a further 364 day
	        revolving period at the option of the syndicate. If not extended, the
	        revolving credit facility is converted to a two year term facility
	        with the principal payable at the end of such two year term. The
	        credit facilities contain standard commercial covenants for
	        facilities of this nature. The only financial covenant is a
	        requirement for AOG to maintain a minimum cash flow to interest
	        expense ratio of 3.5:1, determined on a rolling four quarter basis.
	        The credit facilities also prohibit the Fund from entering into any
	        derivative contract where the term of such contract exceeds two years
	        or the aggregate of such contracts hedge greater than 60% of the
	        Fund's estimated oil and gas production. Breach of any covenant will
	        result in an event of default in which case AOG has 20 days to remedy
	        such default. If the default is not remedied or waived, and if
	        required by the majority of lenders, the administrative agent of the
	        lenders has the option to declare all obligations of AOG under the
	        credit facilities to be immediately due and payable without further
	        demand, presentation, protest, or notice of any kind. Distributions
	        by AOG to the Fund (and effectively by the Fund to Unitholders) are
	        subordinated to the repayment of any amounts owing under the credit
	        facilities. Distributions to Unitholders are not permitted if the
	        Fund is in default of such credit facilities or if the amount of the
	        Fund's outstanding indebtedness under such facilities exceeds the
	        then existing current borrowing base. Interest payments under the
	        debentures are also subordinated to indebtedness under the credit
	        facilities and payments under the debentures are similarly
	        restricted. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the effective
	        interest rate on the outstanding amounts under the facility was
	        approximately 5.0% (2007 - 5.7%).

	    9.  Asset Retirement Obligations

	        The Fund's asset retirement obligations result from net ownership
	        interests in petroleum and natural gas assets including well sites,
	        gathering systems and processing facilities. The Fund estimates the
	        total undiscounted and inflated amount of cash flows required to
	        settle its asset retirement obligations is approximately $249.9
	        million which will be incurred between 2009 and 2058. A credit-
	        adjusted risk-free rate of 7% and an inflation factor of 2% were used
	        to calculate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations.

	        A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligations is provided
	        below:

	    10. Income Taxes

	        The taxable income of the Fund is comprised of interest income
	        related to the AOG Notes and royalty income from the AOG Royalty less
	        deductions for Canadian Oil and Gas Property Expense, Trust Unit
	        issue costs, and interest on convertible debentures. Given that
	        taxable income of the Fund is allocated to the Unitholders, no
	        provision for current income taxes relating to the Fund is included
	        in these financial statements. On December 14, 2007, the Federal
	        government enacted legislation phasing in corporate income tax rate
	        reductions which will reduce federal tax rates from 22.1% to 15.0% by
	        2012. Rate reductions will also apply to the new tax on distributions
	        of income trusts and other specified investment flow-through entities
	        as of 2011, reducing the tax rate in 2011 to 29.5% and in 2012 to
	        28.0%. These rates include a deemed provincial rate of 13%.

	        The provision for income taxes varies from the amount that would be
	        computed by applying the combined Canadian federal and provincial
	        income tax rates for the following reasons:

	        On June 23, 2006, Advantage internalized the external management
	        contract structure and eliminated all related fees for total original
	        consideration of 1,933,208 Advantage Trust Units initially valued at
	        $39.1 million and subject to escrow provisions over a 3-year period,
	        vesting one-third each year beginning June 23, 2007. For the year
	        ended December 31, 2008, a total of 10,351 Trust Units issued for the
	        management internalization were forfeited (2007 - 24,909 Trust Units)
	        and $7.0 million has been recognized as management internalization
	        expense (2007 - $15.7 million). As at December 31, 2008, 564,612
	        Trust Units remain held in escrow (December 31, 2007 - 1,193,622
	        Trust Units).

	        On July 24, 2006, Advantage announced that it adopted a Premium
	        Distribution(TM), Distribution Reinvestment and Optional Trust Unit
	        Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). For eligible Unitholders that elect to
	        participate in the Plan, Advantage will settle the monthly
	        distribution obligation through the issuance of additional Trust
	        Units at 95% of the Average Market Price (as defined in the Plan).
	        Unitholder enrollment in the Premium Distribution(TM) component of
	        the Plan effectively authorizes the subsequent disposal of the issued
	        Trust Units in exchange for a cash payment equal to 102% of the cash
	        distributions that the Unitholder would otherwise have received if
	        they did not participate in the Plan. During the year ended December
	        31, 2008, 4,414,830 Trust Units (2007 - 4,028,252 Trust Units) were
	        issued under the Plan, generating $39.9 million (2007 - $46.7
	        million) reinvested in the Fund.

	        On February 14, 2007 Advantage issued 7,800,000 Trust Units, plus an
	        additional 800,000 Trust Units upon exercise of the Underwriters'
	        over-allotment option on March 7, 2007, at $12.80 per Trust Unit for
	        approximate net proceeds of $104.1 million (net of Underwriters' fees
	        and other issue costs of $6.0 million).

	        On September 5, 2007, Advantage issued 16,977,184 Trust Units, valued
	        at $228.9 million, as partial consideration for the acquisition of
	        Sound (note 3). Trust Unit issuance costs of $0.3 million were
	        incurred for the Sound acquisition.

	        Due to the acquisition of Sound (note 3), 8.75% and 8.00% convertible
	        debentures were assumed by Advantage on September 5, 2007. As a
	        result of the change in control of Sound, the Fund was required by
	        the debenture indentures to make an offer to purchase all of the
	        outstanding convertible debentures assumed from Sound at a price
	        equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
	        interest. On October 17, 2007, the expiry date of the offer, 911,709
	        Trust Units were issued and $19.9 million in total cash consideration
	        was paid in exchange for $29,665,000 8.75% convertible debentures and
	        2,220,289 Trust Units were issued in exchange for $25,507,000 8.0%
	        convertible debentures.

	        (c) Trust Units Rights Incentive Plan

	        Effective June 25, 2002, a Trust Units Rights Incentive Plan for
	        external directors of the Fund was established and approved by the
	        Unitholders of Advantage. A total of 500,000 Trust Units were
	        reserved for issuance under the plan with an aggregate of 400,000
	        rights granted since inception. At December 31, 2007, 150,000 rights
	        remained outstanding under the plan, all of which were exercised at
	        $8.60 per right in 2008 for total cash proceeds of $1,290,000.
	        Contributed surplus of $691,000 in respect of these rights has been
	        transferred to Unitholders' capital. No Trust Unit Rights are
	        outstanding as of December 31, 2008.

	        (d) Unit-based compensation

	        Advantage's current employee compensation includes a Restricted Trust
	        Unit Plan, as approved by the Unitholders on June 23, 2006. The
	        purpose of the long-term compensation plan is to retain and attract
	        employees, to reward and encourage performance, and to focus
	        employees on operating and financial performance that results in
	        lasting Unitholder return.

	        Although Advantage experienced a negative return for the 2008 year,
	        the approved peer group also experienced likewise negative returns.
	        As a result, Advantage's 2008 annual return was within the top two-
	        thirds of the approved peer group and the Board of Directors granted
	        Restricted Trust Units at their discretion. The RTU was deemed to be
	        granted at January 15, 2009 and was valued at $3.8 million to be
	        issued in Trust Units at $5.49 per Trust Unit. No compensation
	        expense was included in general and administration expense for the
	        year ended December 31, 2008 as the RTU was granted after year-end. A
	        total of 171,093 Trust Units were issued to employees in early 2009
	        in satisfaction of the first third of the grant that vested
	        immediately. The remaining two-thirds of the RTU grant will vest
	        evenly on the following two yearly anniversary dates. Since
	        implementing the Plan in 2006, the grant thresholds have not been
	        previously met, and there have been no RTU grants made during prior
	        years and no related compensation expense has been recognized.

	        (e) Net loss per Trust Unit

	        The calculations of basic and diluted net loss per Trust Unit are
	        derived from both loss available to Unitholders and weighted average
	        Trust Units outstanding calculated as follows:

	                                                   Year ended    Year ended
	                                                   December 31,  December 31,
	                                                      2008          2007
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	        Loss available to Unitholders
	          Basic and diluted                        $   (20,577)  $    (7,535)
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	        Weighted average Trust Units outstanding
	          Basic and diluted                        139,483,151   119,604,019
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	        The calculation of diluted net loss per Trust Unit excludes all
	        series of convertible debentures for the years as the impact would be
	        anti-dilutive. Total weighted average Trust Units issuable in
	        exchange for the convertible debentures and excluded from the diluted
	        net loss per Trust Unit calculation for the year ended December 31,
	        2008 were 9,713,840 (2007 - 9,083,663 Trust Units). As at
	        December 31, 2008, the total convertible debentures outstanding were
	        immediately convertible to 9,529,075 Trust Units (2007 -
	        9,847,253 Trust Units).

	        All of the Trust Unit Rights and Management Internalization escrowed
	        Trust Units have been excluded from the calculations of diluted net
	        loss per Trust Unit for the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2007
	        as the impacts would be anti-dilutive. Total weighted average Trust
	        Units issuable in exchange for the Trust Unit Rights and Management
	        Internalization escrowed Trust Units and excluded from the diluted
	        net loss per Trust Unit calculation for the year ended December 31,
	        2008 were 8,795 and 576,827, respectively (year ended December 31,
	        2007 - 42,918 and 582,861 Trust Units, respectively).

	    12. Accumulated Deficit

	        Accumulated deficit consists of accumulated income and accumulated
	        distributions for the Fund since inception as follows:

	                                                   December 31,  December 31,
	                                                       2008          2007
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	        Accumulated Income                         $   199,411   $   219,988
	        Accumulated Distributions                   (1,076,465)     (879,823)
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	        Accumulated Deficit                        $  (877,054)  $  (659,835)
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	        The Fund has historically paid distributions in excess of accumulated
	        income as distributions are typically based on cash flows generated
	        in the period while accumulated income is based on such cash flows
	        less other non-cash charges such as depletion, depreciation, and
	        accretion expense recorded on the original investment in petroleum
	        and natural gas properties, management internalization expense and
	        other asset impairments. For the year ended December 31, 2008 the
	        Fund declared $196.6 million in distributions representing $1.40 per
	        distributable Trust Unit (2007 - $215.2 million in distributions
	        representing $1.77 per distributable Trust Unit).

	    13. Financial Instruments

	        Financial instruments of the Fund include accounts receivable,
	        deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, distributions
	        payable to Unitholders, bank indebtedness, convertible debentures and
	        derivative assets and liabilities.

	        Accounts receivable and deposits are classified as loans and
	        receivables and measured at amortized cost. Accounts payable and
	        accrued liabilities, distributions payable to Unitholders and bank
	        indebtedness are all classified as other liabilities and similarly
	        measured at amortized cost. As at December 31, 2008, there were no
	        significant differences between the carrying amounts reported on the
	        balance sheet and the estimated fair values of these financial
	        instruments due to the short terms to maturity and the floating
	        interest rate on the bank indebtedness.

	        The Fund has convertible debenture obligations outstanding, of which
	        the liability component has been classified as other liabilities and
	        measured at amortized cost. The convertible debentures have different
	        fixed terms and interest rates (note 7) resulting in fair values that
	        will vary over time as market conditions change. As at December 31,
	        2008, the estimated fair value of the total outstanding convertible
	        debenture obligation was $191.2 million (December 31, 2007 -
	        $215.4 million). The fair value of convertible debentures was
	        determined based on the current public trading activity of such
	        debentures.

	        Advantage has an established strategy to manage the risk associated
	        with changes in commodity prices by entering into derivatives, which
	        are recorded at fair value as derivative assets and liabilities with
	        gains and losses recognized through earnings. As the fair value of
	        the contracts varies with commodity prices, they give rise to
	        financial assets and liabilities. The fair values of the derivatives
	        are determined through valuation models completed internally and by
	        third parties. Various assumptions based on current market
	        information were used in these valuations, including settled forward
	        commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, volatility
	        and other relevant factors. The actual gains and losses realized on
	        eventual cash settlement can vary materially due to subsequent
	        fluctuations in commodity prices as compared to the valuation
	        assumptions.

	        Credit Risk

	        Accounts receivable, deposits, and derivative assets are subject to
	        credit risk exposure and the carrying values reflect Management's
	        assessment of the associated maximum exposure to such credit risk.
	        Advantage mitigates such credit risk by closely monitoring
	        significant counterparties and dealing with a broad selection of
	        partners that diversify risk within the sector. The Fund's deposits
	        are primarily due from the Alberta Provincial government and are
	        viewed by Management as having minimal associated credit risk. To the
	        extent that Advantage enters derivatives to manage commodity price
	        risk, it may be subject to credit risk associated with counterparties
	        with which it contracts. Credit risk is mitigated by entering into
	        contracts with only stable, creditworthy parties and through frequent
	        reviews of exposures to individual entities. In addition, the Fund
	        only enters into derivative contracts with major national banks and
	        international energy firms to further mitigate associated credit
	        risk.

	        Substantially all of the Fund's accounts receivable are due from
	        customers and joint operation partners concentrated in the Canadian
	        oil and gas industry. As such, accounts receivable are subject to
	        normal industry credit risks. As at December 31, 2008, $14.2 million
	        or 17% of accounts receivable are outstanding for 90 days or more.
	        The Fund believes that the entire balance is collectible, and in some
	        instances we have the ability to mitigate risk through withholding
	        production or offsetting payables with the same parties. Accordingly,
	        management has not provided for an allowance for doubtful accounts at
	        December 31, 2008.

	        Liquidity Risk

	        The Fund is subject to liquidity risk attributed from accounts
	        payable and accrued liabilities, distributions payable to
	        Unitholders, bank indebtedness, convertible debentures, and
	        derivative liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
	        distributions payable to Unitholders and derivative liabilities are
	        primarily due within one year of the balance sheet date and Advantage
	        does not anticipate any problems in satisfying the obligations due to
	        the strength of cash provided by operating activities and the
	        existing credit facility. The Fund's bank indebtedness is subject to
	        a $710 million credit facility agreement. Although the credit
	        facility is a source of liquidity risk, the facility also mitigates
	        liquidity risk by enabling Advantage to manage interim cash flow
	        fluctuations. The credit facility constitutes a revolving facility
	        for a 364 day term which is extendible annually for a further 364 day
	        revolving period at the option of the syndicate. If not extended, the
	        revolving credit facility is converted to a two year term facility
	        with the principal payable at the end of such two year term. The
	        terms of the credit facility are such that it provides Advantage
	        adequate flexibility to evaluate and assess liquidity issues if and
	        when they arise. Additionally, the Fund regularly monitors liquidity
	        related to obligations by evaluating forecasted cash flows, optimal
	        debt levels, capital spending activity, working capital requirements,
	        and other potential cash expenditures. This continual financial
	        assessment process further enables the Fund to mitigate liquidity
	        risk.

	        Advantage has several series of convertible debentures outstanding
	        that mature from 2009 to 2011 (note 7). Interest payments are made
	        semi-annually with excess cash provided by operating activities. As
	        the debentures become due, the Fund can satisfy the obligations in
	        cash or issue Trust Units at a price determined in the applicable
	        debenture agreements. This settlement alternative allows the Fund to
	        adequately manage liquidity, plan available cash resources and
	        implement an optimal capital structure.

	        To the extent that Advantage enters derivatives to manage commodity
	        price risk, it may be subject to liquidity risk as derivative
	        liabilities become due. While the Fund has elected not to follow
	        hedge accounting, derivative instruments are not entered for
	        speculative purposes and Management closely monitors existing
	        commodity risk exposures. As such, liquidity risk is mitigated since
	        any losses actually realized are subsidized by increased cash flows
	        realized from the higher commodity price environment.

	        The timing of cash outflows relating to financial liabilities are as
	        follows:
	                                  One to      Four
	                      Less than    three     to five

	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	        The Fund's bank indebtedness does not have specific maturity dates.
	        It is governed by a credit facility agreement with a syndicate of
	        financial institutions (note 8). Under the terms of the agreement,
	        the facility is reviewed annually, with the next review scheduled in
	        June 2009. The facility is revolving, and is extendible at each
	        annual review for a further 364 day period at the option of the
	        syndicate. If not extended, the credit facility is converted at that
	        time into a two year term facility, with the principal payable at the
	        end of such two year term. Management fully expects that the facility
	        will be extended at each annual review.

	        Interest Rate Risk

	        The Fund is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that bank
	        indebtedness is at a floating rate of interest and the Fund's maximum
	        exposure to interest rate risk is based on the effective interest
	        rate and the current carrying value of the bank indebtedness. The
	        Fund monitors the interest rate markets to ensure that appropriate
	        steps can be taken if interest rate volatility compromises the Fund's
	        cash flows. A 1% increase in interest rate for the year ended
	        December 31, 2008 could have increased net loss by approximately
	        $4.2 million for that period (year ended December 31, 2007 -
	        $3.0 million).

	        Price and Currency Risk

	        Advantage's derivative assets and liabilities are subject to both
	        price and currency risks as their fair values are based on
	        assumptions including forward commodity prices and foreign exchange
	        rates. The Fund enters derivative financial instruments to manage
	        commodity price risk exposure relative to actual commodity production
	        and does not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
	        Changes in the price assumptions can have a significant effect on the
	        fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities and thereby
	        impact net income. It is estimated that a 10% change in the forward
	        natural gas prices used to calculate the fair value of the natural
	        gas derivatives at December 31, 2008 could impact net loss by
	        approximately $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As
	        well, a change of 10% in the forward crude oil prices used to
	        calculate the fair value of the crude oil derivatives at December 31,
	        2008 could impact net loss by $2.8 million for the year ended
	        December 31, 2008. A similar change in the currency rate assumption
	        underlying the derivatives fair value does not have a material impact
	        on net income.

	        As at December 31, 2008 the Fund had the following derivatives in

	        As at December 31, 2008, the fair value of the derivatives
	        outstanding resulted in an asset of approximately $42,620,000
	        (December 31, 2007 - $7,201,000) and a liability of approximately
	        $1,650,000 (December 31, 2007 - $5,020,000). For the year ended
	        December 31, 2008, $38,789,000 was recognized in net loss as an
	        unrealized derivative gain (December 31, 2007 - $11,049,000
	        unrealized derivative loss) and $27,439,000 was recognized in net
	        loss as a realized derivative loss (December 31, 2007 - $18,594,000
	        realized derivative gain).

	    14. Management Internalization

	        Concurrent with the acquisition of Ketch Resources Trust in 2006,
	        Advantage internalized the external management contract structure and
	        eliminated all related fees. The Fund reached an agreement with
	        Advantage Investment Management Ltd. ("AIM" or the "Manager") to
	        purchase all of the outstanding shares of AIM pursuant to the terms
	        of the Plan of Arrangement for total original consideration of
	        1,933,208 Advantage Trust Units. The Trust Units were initially
	        valued at $39.1 million using the weighted average trading value for
	        Advantage Trust Units on the Unitholder approval date of June 22,
	        2006 and are subject to escrow provisions over a 3-year period,
	        vesting one-third each year beginning in 2007. The management
	        internalization consideration is being deferred and amortized into
	        income as management internalization expense over the specific
	        vesting periods during which employee services are provided,
	        including an estimate of future Trust Unit forfeitures. For the year
	        ended December 31, 2008, a total of 10,351 Trust Units issued for the
	        management internalization were forfeited (2007 - 24,909 Trust Units)
	        and $7.0 million has been recognized as management internalization
	        expense (2007 - $15.7 million). As at December 31, 2008,
	        564,612 Trust Units remain held in escrow (December 31, 2007 -
	        1,193,622 Trust Units).

	    15. Capital Management

	        The Fund manages its capital with the following objectives:

	        -  To ensure sufficient financial flexibility to achieve the ongoing
	           business objectives including replacement of production, funding
	           of future growth opportunities, and pursuit of accretive
	           acquisitions; and

	        -  To maximize Unitholder return through enhancing the Trust Unit
	           value.

	        Advantage monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments
	        according to market conditions in an effort to meet its objectives
	        given the current outlook of the business and industry in general.
	        The capital structure of the Fund is composed of working capital
	        (excluding derivative assets and liabilities), bank indebtedness,
	        convertible debentures, capital lease obligations and Unitholders'
	        equity. Advantage may manage its capital structure by issuing new
	        Trust Units, obtaining additional financing either through bank
	        indebtedness or convertible debenture issuances, refinancing current
	        debt, issuing other financial or equity-based instruments, adjusting
	        or discontinuing the amount of monthly distributions, suspending or
	        renewing its distribution reinvestment plan, adjusting capital
	        spending, or disposing of non-core assets. The capital structure is
	        reviewed by Management and the Board of Directors on an ongoing
	        basis. Advantage's capital structure as at December 31, 2008 is as
	        follows:

	                                                           December 31, 2008
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	        Bank indebtedness (long-term)                            $   587,404
	        Working capital deficit(1)                                   146,397
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	        Net debt                                                     733,801
	        Trust Units outstanding market value                         731,263
	        Convertible debentures maturity value (long-term)            132,221
	        Capital lease obligations (long-term)                          3,906
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	        Total                                                    $ 1,601,191
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	        (1) Working capital deficit includes accounts receivable, prepaid
	            expenses and deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
	            distributions payable, and the current portion of capital lease
	            obligations and convertible debentures.


	        The Fund's bank indebtedness is governed by a $710 million credit
	        facility agreement (note 8) that contains standard commercial
	        covenants for facilities of this nature. The only financial covenant
	        is a requirement for AOG to maintain a minimum cash flow to interest
	        expense ratio of 3.5:1, determined on a rolling four quarter basis.
	        The Fund is in compliance with all credit facility covenants. As
	        well, the borrowing base for the Fund's credit facilities is
	        determined through utilizing Advantage's regular reserve estimates.
	        The banking syndicate thoroughly evaluates the reserve estimates
	        based upon their own commodity price expectations to determine the
	        amount of the borrowing base. Revision or changes in the reserve
	        estimates and commodity prices can have either a positive or a
	        negative impact on the borrowing base of the Fund. Advantage's
	        issuance of convertible debentures is limited by its Trust Indenture
	        which currently restricts the issuance of additional convertible
	        debentures to 25% of market capitalization subsequent to issuance.
	        Advantage's Trust Indenture also provides for the issuance of an
	        unlimited number of Trust Units. However, through tax legislation, an
	        income trust is restricted to doubling its market capitalization as
	        it stands on October 31, 2006 by growing a maximum of 40% in 2007 and
	        20% for the years 2008 to 2010. In addition, an income trust may
	        replace debt that was outstanding as of October 31, 2006 with new
	        equity or issue new, non-convertible debt without affecting the
	        normal growth percentage. As a result of the "normal growth"
	        guidelines, the Fund is permitted to issue approximately $2.3 billion
	        of new equity from January 1, 2009 to January 1, 2011, which we
	        believe is adequate for any growth we expect to incur. If an income
	        trust exceeds the established limits on the issuance of new trust
	        units and convertible debt that constitute normal growth, the income
	        trust will be immediately subject to the Specified Investment
	        Flow-Through Entity tax legislation whereby the taxable portion of
	        distributions paid will be subject to tax at the trust level.

	        Management of the Fund's capital structure is facilitated through its
	        financial and operational forecasting processes. The forecast of the
	        Fund's future cash flows is based on estimates of production,
	        commodity prices, forecast capital and operating expenditures, and
	        other investing and financing activities. The forecast is regularly
	        updated based on new commodity prices and other changes, which the
	        Fund views as critical in the current environment. Selected forecast
	        information is frequently provided to the Board of Directors.

	        The Fund's capital management objectives, policies and processes have
	        remained unchanged during the year ended December 31, 2008.

	    16. Commitments

	        Advantage has several lease commitments relating to office buildings.
	        The estimated annual minimum operating lease rental payments for
	        buildings are as follows:

	        2009                                                      $    3,862
	        2010                                                           3,878
	        2011                                                           1,471
	        2012                                                           1,072
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	                                                                  $   10,283
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	    17. Subsequent event

	        On March 18, 2009, Advantage announced that our Board of Directors
	        had approved conversion to a growth oriented corporation and a
	        strategic asset disposition program to increase financial
	        flexibility.

	        The corporate conversion will be subject to approval by at least
	        two-thirds of the Fund's Unitholders as well as customary court and
	        regulatory approvals, anticipated to be completed on or about
	        June 30, 2009. The conversion will enable Advantage to pursue a
	        business plan that is focused on the development and growth of the
	        Montney natural gas resource play at Glacier.

	        The Fund has engaged an advisory firm to assist in the disposal of
	        light oil and natural gas properties located in Northeast British
	        Columbia, West Central Alberta and Northern Alberta with proposals
	        anticipated by mid May 2009.

	        As another step to increase Advantage's financial flexibility and to
	        focus on development and growth at Glacier, Advantage announced it
	        will discontinue payment of cash distributions with the final cash
	        distribution paid on March 16, 2009 to Unitholders of record as of
	        February 27, 2009. Going forward, Advantage does not anticipate
	        paying  distributions or dividends in the immediate future and will
	        instead direct cash flow to capital expenditures and debt repayment.

	    18. Reconciliation of Financial Statements to United States Generally
	        Accepted Accounting Principles

	        The consolidated financial statements of Advantage have been prepared
	        in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
	        Canada. Canadian GAAP, in most respects, conforms to generally
	        accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP"). Any
	        differences in accounting principles between Canadian GAAP and US
	        GAAP, as they apply to Advantage, are not material, except as
	        described below.

	        (a) Unit-based compensation

	        Advantage accounts for compensation expense based on the fair value
	        of the equity awards on the grant date and the initial fair value is
	        not subsequently remeasured. Advantage's unit-based compensation
	        consists of a Restricted Trust Unit Plan and Trust Units held in
	        escrow subject to service requirement provisions. The initial fair
	        value is expensed over the vesting period of the Trust Units or
	        rights granted.

	        Under US GAAP, the Fund adopted SFAS 123(R) "Share-Based Payment" on
	        January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective approach and applies
	        the fair value method of accounting for all Unit-based compensation
	        granted after January 1, 2006. A US GAAP difference exists as
	        unit-based compensation grants are considered liability awards for US
	        GAAP and equity awards for Canadian GAAP. Under US GAAP, the fair
	        value of a liability award is measured at the grant date and is
	        subsequently remeasured at each reporting period. When the rights are
	        exercised and the Trust Units vested, the amount recorded as a
	        liability is recognized as temporary equity.

	        (b) Convertible debentures

	        The Fund applies CICA 3863 "Financial Instruments - Presentation" in
	        accounting for convertible debentures which results in their
	        classification as liabilities. The convertible debentures also have
	        an embedded conversion feature which must be segregated between
	        liabilities and equity, based on the relative fair market value of
	        the liability and equity portions. Therefore, the debenture
	        liabilities are presented at less than their eventual maturity
	        values. The liability and equity components are further reduced for
	        issuance costs initially incurred. The discount of the liability
	        component, net of issuance costs, as compared to maturity value is
	        accreted by the effective interest method over the debenture term. As
	        debentures are converted to Trust Units, an appropriate portion of
	        the liability and equity components are transferred to Unitholders'
	        capital. Interest and accretion expense on the convertible debentures
	        are shown on the Consolidated Statements of Loss.

	        Under US GAAP, the entire convertible debenture balance would be
	        shown as a liability. The embedded conversion feature would not be
	        accounted for separately as a component of equity. Additionally,
	        under US GAAP, issuance costs are generally shown as a deferred
	        charge rather than netted from the convertible debenture balance and
	        are amortized to interest expense over the term of the debenture.
	        Given that the convertible debentures are carried at maturity value,
	        it is not necessary to accrete the balance over the term of the
	        debentures which results in an expense reduction. Interest and
	        accretion on convertible debentures represents interest expense on
	        the convertible debentures and amortization of the associated
	        deferred issuance costs.

	        (c) Depletion and depreciation

	        For Canadian GAAP, depletion of petroleum and natural gas properties
	        and depreciation of lease and well equipment is provided on
	        accumulated costs using the unit-of-production method based on
	        estimated net proved petroleum and natural gas reserves, before
	        royalties, based on forecast prices and costs.

	        US GAAP provides for a similar accounting methodology except that
	        estimated net proved petroleum and natural gas reserves are net of
	        royalties and based on constant prices and costs. Therefore,
	        depletion and depreciation under US GAAP will be different since
	        changes to royalty rates will impact both proved reserves and
	        production and differences between constant prices and costs as
	        compared to forecast prices and costs will impact proved reserve
	        volumes. Additionally, differences in depletion and depreciation will
	        result in divergence of net book value for Canadian GAAP and US GAAP
	        from year-to-year and impact future depletion and depreciation
	        expense as well as the net book value utilized for future ceiling
	        test calculations.

	        (d) Ceiling test

	        Under Canadian GAAP, petroleum and natural gas assets are evaluated
	        each reporting period to determine that the carrying amount is
	        recoverable and does not exceed the fair value of the properties in
	        the cost centre (the "ceiling test"). The carrying amounts are
	        assessed to be recoverable when the sum of the undiscounted net cash
	        flows expected from the production of proved reserves, the lower of
	        cost and market of unproved properties and the cost of major
	        development projects exceeds the carrying amount of the cost centre.
	        When the carrying amount is not assessed to be recoverable, an
	        impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount
	        of the cost centre exceeds the sum of the discounted net cash flows
	        expected from the production of proved and probable reserves, the
	        lower of cost and market of unproved properties and the cost of major
	        development projects of the cost centre. The cash flows are estimated
	        using expected future product prices and costs and are discounted
	        using a risk-free interest rate. For Canadian GAAP purposes,
	        Advantage has not recognized an impairment loss since inception.

	        Under US GAAP, the carrying amounts of petroleum and natural gas
	        assets, net of deferred income taxes, shall not exceed an amount
	        equal to the sum of the present value of estimated net future
	        after-tax cash flows of proved reserves (at current prices and costs
	        as of the balance sheet date) computed using a discount factor of
	        ten percent plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of
	        unproved properties. Any excess is charged to expense as an
	        impairment loss. Under US GAAP, Advantage recognized impairment
	        losses of $49.5 million in 2001 ($28.3 million net of tax),
	        $535.4 million in 2006 ($477.8 million net of tax), and
	        $1,047.5 million in 2008 ($770.8 million net of tax). Impairment
	        losses decrease net book value of property and equipment which
	        reduces depletion and depreciation expense subsequently recorded as
	        well as future ceiling test calculations.

	        (e) Income tax

	        The future income tax accounting standard under Canadian GAAP is
	        substantially similar to the deferred income tax approach as required
	        by US GAAP. Pursuant to Canadian GAAP, substantively enacted tax
	        rates are used to calculate future income tax, whereas US GAAP
	        applies enacted tax rates. However, there were no tax rate
	        differences for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The
	        differences between Canadian GAAP and US GAAP relate to future income
	        tax impact on GAAP differences for fixed assets.

	        Under Canadian GAAP as at December 31, 2008, the Fund's carrying
	        value of its net assets exceeded its tax bases and resulted in a
	        future income tax liability. Adjustments under US GAAP result in a
	        large future income tax recovery and a future income tax asset, as
	        the ceiling test write down significantly lowered the Fund's fixed
	        assets carrying value under US GAAP.

	        Under US GAAP, an entity that is subject to income tax in multiple
	        jurisdictions is required to disclose income tax expense in each
	        jurisdiction. The total amount of income taxes in 2007 and 2008 is
	        entirely at the provincial level.

	        (f) Goodwill

	        Under Canadian and US GAAP, the Fund is required to test the carrying
	        amount of goodwill at each balance sheet reporting date and the
	        methodologies are substantially the same. However, the carrying value
	        of the reporting unit (the Fund) under US GAAP is much lower due to
	        the impairments to property, plant and equipment required under US
	        GAAP (note 18(d)). As the fair value of the reporting unit (the Fund)
	        is in excess of its carrying values as determined under US GAAP,
	        there is no impairment of goodwill for US GAAP reporting purposes.

	        (g) Unitholders' equity

	        Unitholders' equity of Advantage consists primarily of Trust Units.
	        The Trust Units are redeemable at any time on demand by the holders,
	        which is required for the Fund to retain its Canadian mutual fund
	        trust status. The holders are entitled to receive a price per Trust
	        Unit equal to the lesser of: (i) 85% of the simple average of the
	        closing market prices of the Trust Units, on the principal market on
	        which the Trust Units are quoted for trading, during the
	        10 trading-day period commencing immediately after the date on which
	        the Trust Units are surrendered for redemption; and (ii) the closing
	        market price on the principal market on which the Trust Units are
	        quoted for trading on the redemption date. For Canadian GAAP
	        purposes, the Trust Units are considered permanent equity and are
	        presented as a component of Unitholders' equity.

	        Under US GAAP, it is required that equity with a redemption feature
	        be presented as temporary equity between the liability and equity
	        sections of the balance sheet. The temporary equity is shown at an
	        amount equal to the redemption value based on the terms of the Trust
	        Units. Changes in the redemption value from year-to-year are charged
	        to deficit. All components of Unitholders' equity related to Trust
	        Units are eliminated. When calculating net income per Trust Unit,
	        increases in the redemption value during a period results in a
	        reduction of net income available to Unitholders while decreases in
	        the redemption value increases net income available to Unitholders.
	        For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, net income available
	        to Unitholders was increased by $476.2 million and $390.3 million
	        corresponding to changes in the Trust Units redemption value for the
	        respective periods.

	        A continuity schedule of significant equity accounts for each
	        reporting period is required disclosure under US GAAP. The following
	        table is a continuity of unitholders' equity, the Fund's only
	        significant equity account:

	                                                   Year ended    Year ended

	        (h) Balance Sheet Disclosure

	        US GAAP requires disclosure of certain line items for balances that
	        would be aggregated in the Canadian GAAP financials. The following
	        are the additional line items to be disclosed for accounts receivable
	        and accounts payable:

	                                                   December 31,  December 31,

	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	        (i) Statements of cash flow

	        The differences between Canadian GAAP and US GAAP have not resulted
	        in any significant variances concerning the statements of cash flows
	        as reported.

	        (j) Sound acquisition

	        On September 5, 2007, Advantage acquired all of the issued and
	        outstanding Trust Units and Exchangeable Shares of Sound. The
	        accounting for business combinations is effectively the same under
	        US and Canadian GAAP. However, the purchase price under US GAAP is
	        different as a result of AOG realizing a future income tax asset from
	        previously unrecognized temporary differences. The purchase price
	        under US GAAP has been allocated as follows:

	        Net assets acquired and
	         liabilities assumed:                 Consideration:

	        Fixed assets             $ 484,630    16,977,184 Trust

	        (k) US Accounting Pronouncements Implemented

	        SFAS 157 Fair Value Measurements: This Statement defines fair value,
	        establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands
	        disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies
	        under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair
	        value measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any
	        new fair value measurements. The implementation date for this
	        standard was originally as of the beginning of the first interim or
	        annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2007. However,
	        the FASB postponed this implementation date by one year for
	        non-financial assets and liabilities by the issuance of Staff
	        Position 157-2. Accordingly, the Fund has implemented FAS 157 for all
	        financial assets and liabilities only. The implementation did not
	        result in any changes to the fair values of financial assets and
	        liabilities of the Fund.

	        (l) Recent US Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Implemented

	        SFAS 141 (R) Business Combinations: This Statement requires assets
	        and liabilities acquired in a business combination, contingent
	        consideration, and certain acquired contingencies to be measured at
	        their fair values as of the date of acquisition. In addition,
	        acquisition-related and restructuring costs are to be recognized
	        separately from the business combination. This standard applies to
	        business combinations entered into after January 1, 2009. As the
	        standard is applied prospectively, the Fund will assess the impact on
	        any future business combinations.

	        FASB Staff Position 157-2: This Staff Position delays the
	        implementation of the requirements of SFAS 157 with respect to
	        non-financial assets and liabilities, until the first interim or
	        annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2008. The Fund
	        has not yet assessed the full impact, if any, of this standard on the
	        consolidated financial statements.

	        SFAS 162, Hierarchy of GAAP: This Statement establishes a hierarchy
	        among the existing types of accounting pronouncements in the United
	        States. The implementation date for this standard is as of the
	        beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins
	        after November 15, 2008. The Fund has assessed the impact of this
	        Statement and does not anticipate any significant impact on the
	        consolidated financial statements.

	        FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt
	        Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including
	        Partial Cash Settlement): If an entity issues convertible debt within
	        the scope of the Staff Position, it is required to separate the
	        instrument into a liability-classified component and an
	        equity-classified component. The implementation date for this
	        standard was originally as of the beginning of the first interim or
	        annual reporting period that begins after December 15, 2008. The Fund
	        has assessed the impact of this Staff Position and does not
	        anticipate any significant impact on the consolidated financial
	        statements.

	        The application of US GAAP would have the following effect on net
	        loss as reported:
