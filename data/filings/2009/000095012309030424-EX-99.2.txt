MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

August 5, 2009

The following interim management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) updates our
annual MD&A included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, to which our
readers are referred. No update is provided where an item is not material or
there has been no material change from the discussion in our annual MD&A.

2009 Second Quarter Operating Results

NET EARNINGS

Agrium's second quarter consolidated net earnings were $370-million, or $2.35
diluted earnings per share, compared to net earnings of $636-million, or
$4.00 diluted earnings per share, for the same quarter of 2008. Consolidated
net earnings for the first half of 2009 were $310-million, or $1.97 diluted
earnings per share, compared to $831-million, or $5.24 diluted earnings per
share, for the same period last year. Net earnings before interest expense
and income taxes ("EBIT") were $543-million for the second quarter of 2009
compared with EBIT of $972-million for the second quarter of 2008. EBIT for
the first half of 2009 was $487-million compared with EBIT of $1.3-billion
for the first half of 2008. A reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings is
provided in the section "Non-GAAP Measures". Consolidated gross profit in the
second quarter of 2009 was $890-million, a $371-million decrease compared to
$1.3-billion in the second quarter of 2008. Consolidated gross profit in the
first half of 2009 was $1.2-billion, a $490-million decrease compared to
$1.7-billion for the same period of 2008. The decreases in
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year EBIT and gross profit were primarily
due to



reduced potash sales volumes and lower selling prices for most
products. For discussion on the performance of each business unit, see
section "Business Segment Performance".

Expenses were $90-million higher in the second quarter and $332-million
higher in the first half of 2009 compared to the same periods last year due
primarily to significantly lower gains on derivative financial instruments
and an increase in Retail selling expenses due the inclusion of the UAP
business since May 5, 2008, partly offset by lower stock-based compensation
expense and lower potash profit taxes.

The effective tax rate was 28 percent for both the second quarter and first
half of 2009, compared with an effective tax rate of 33 percent for the
corresponding periods of 2008. The lower tax rate was due to a higher
proportion of income earned in lower taxed jurisdictions in 2009.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE

Retail

Retail's 2009 second quarter net sales were $3.1-billion, which was 26
percent higher than the $2.5-billion in the second quarter of 2008. Gross
profit was $597-million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to
$667-million for the same period last year while Retail EBIT was $283-million
in the second quarter of 2009, versus EBIT of $409-million in the second
quarter of 2008 and $142-million in the same quarter of 2007. Retail results
are not directly comparable to the same period last year due to the inclusion
of UAP, which was acquired on May 5, 2008.

Crop nutrients net sales were $1.3-billion this quarter, an increase of
$59-million compared to the second quarter of 2008. The increase was due to
the additional five weeks of UAP business recorded this quarter, which was
mostly offset by a significant reduction in Legacy Agrium Retail sales
volumes versus the same period last year. Gross profit was $117-million this
quarter compared to $335-million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease
was due to lower sales volumes from Legacy Agrium Retail and significantly
lower margins resulting from the carryover of higher priced crop nutrient
inventories from the fall of 2008, which were sold into a lower price
environment this spring. This resulted in crop nutrient margins averaging 9
percent in the second quarter of 2009, compared to 27 percent in the second
quarter of 2008 or 24 percent in 2007 which was a more normal year. We
anticipate crop nutrient margins to continue to improve in the second half of
2009 and are expected to reach near-normal levels in the fourth quarter as
the majority of the higher priced nutrient inventory position will have been
sold.(1) North American nutrient sales volumes in the second quarter were
also influenced by the late, wet spring season which impacted farmers'
ability to apply crop nutrients. Sales volumes and margins in our South
American operations were also significantly lower this quarter than the same
period last year due to extremely dry conditions and the added challenge of
uncertainty over government policies. We anticipate improved sales volumes in
the second half of 2009 as growers catch up on reduced application rates over
the past year.(1)

Crop protection net sales increased by 41 percent this quarter, reaching
$1.2-billion in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $860-million in the
same period last year. Our gross profit this quarter reached $304-million, an
increase of $81-million over last year's $223-million. The strength of

"Management's Discussion and Analysis".


earnings from this product line illustrates the benefits of the diversity in
our Retail business. Most of the increase in sales and gross profits was due
to the addition of a full quarter of UAP's significant crop protection
business, including a broad range of private label products. Crop protection
product margins as a percentage of net sales were 25 percent for the second
quarter of 2009 as compared to 26 percent for the same period last year
primarily due to lower margins on glyphosate products.

Net sales for seed, services and other increased by 59 percent, to
$629-million this quarter, from $396-million in the second quarter of 2008.
Gross profit was $176-million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to
$109-million for the same period last year. Seed sales accounted for about
$530-million in sales and $104-million in gross profit for the quarter.

Retail selling expenses for the second quarter of 2009 were $273-million, a
29 percent increase over last year's level, primarily due to the inclusion of
an additional five weeks of UAP business. Selling expenses as a percentage of
net sales in the second quarter of 2009 were slightly higher on a quarter
over quarter basis.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were $950-million for the second quarter of 2009
compared to $1.4-billion for the second quarter of 2008. Gross profit was
$212-million in the second quarter of 2009, a $370-million reduction from the
record second quarter for 2008 of $582-million. EBIT of $215-million in the
second quarter of 2009 was significantly lower than the $647-million earned
in the second quarter of 2008. The key factors impacting the results were
lower sales prices and volumes for nitrogen and phosphate products combined
with significantly lower potash sales volumes and lower gains on derivative
financial instruments.

Nitrogen gross profit was $182-million this quarter, compared to $246-million
in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen prices were lower than the same
period last year across all products for both benchmark and Agrium's realized
prices. Sales volumes were similar to the same period last year, with lower
UAN sales volumes, offset by higher Profertil export sales. Nitrogen cost of
product was $227 per tonne this quarter, a 27 percent decrease versus last
year. The lower production cost was a result of lower North American gas
prices and favorable movement in foreign exchange rates. Agrium's nitrogen
margins averaged $146 per tonne this quarter, compared with $196 per tonne in
the second quarter of last year. Ammonia margins were higher than the same
quarter last year. Urea margins were lower than last year but remained well
over $100 per tonne.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $4.59/MMBtu in the second quarter of
2009 versus $7.36/MMBtu in the second quarter of 2008. The U.S. benchmark
(NYMEX) natural gas price for the second quarter of 2009 was $3.60/MMBtu,
versus $10.80/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $4.86/MMBtu in the
first quarter of 2009. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was $0.49/MMBtu
for the second quarter of 2009.



Phosphate gross profit was $12-million, compared to $96-million for the same
quarter last year. Sales volumes were 12 percent lower than the same quarter
last year. Realized sales prices averaged $454 per tonne which were 43
percent less than the $791 per tonne achieved in the same quarter last year.
Benchmark phosphate prices for the same comparative period were down about 70
percent as compared to the second quarter of 2008. Phosphate cost of product
decreased $60 per tonne to $408 per tonne compared to the second quarter of
2008, due to lower sulphur, ammonia and rock costs. Gross margin for
phosphate was $46 per tonne compared with $323 per tonne in the second
quarter of 2008.

Potash gross profit was $23-million versus $184-million in the second quarter
of 2008. Realized selling prices were 81 percent higher than last year's
levels and contributed to higher per tonne margins. The higher prices were
more than offset by the impact of a significant decrease in sales volumes and
higher cost of product due to lower production volumes. Sales volumes
decreased by 513,000 tonnes compared to the same period last year. Both
international and domestic demand were significantly lower than normal due to
a combination of delayed contract settlements in China and India, credit
issues in many other international markets and the current cautious approach
to replenishing stocks by retailers and distributors in North America and
globally. Cost of product on a per tonne basis increased substantially from
the same quarter of 2008 due to lower production volumes, resulting in a
larger proportion of fixed costs being allocated to fewer sales tonnes. Gross
margin on a per tonne basis was $377 per tonne, which was 17 percent above
the $321 per tonne in the second quarter of last year.

Purchase for resale sales volumes were 81 percent higher in the second
quarter of 2009 than last year's levels, largely due to the addition of the
European CMF business. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2009 was a loss
of $28-million versus $29-million in gross profit for the same period last
year. The reduction was due to a 34 percent decrease in overall realized
selling price compared to last year's levels and a $29-million inventory
write-down this quarter as a result of net realizable value adjustments to
our purchased product inventories.

Wholesale expenses were $62-million higher in the second quarter of 2009 than
for the same period last year due primarily to a lower gain in derivative
financial instruments compared to the same period last year. Unrealized net
mark-to-market gains of $38-million and realized losses of $34-million from
natural gas, power and other derivatives in the second quarter of 2009 were
both lower than the significant gains experienced in the same period last
year. This variance in derivative valuations was partially offset by a
decrease in potash profit and capital taxes of $43-million, due mainly to
lower potash sales volumes.

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' second quarter 2009 net sales were $82-million
compared to $107-million in the second quarter of 2008. Net sales and gross
profit were impacted by reduced volumes and margins in turf and ornamental
due to lower household expenditures as a result of the slower economic
growth. ESN net sales were impacted primarily by lower selling prices as
benchmark urea prices were less than half what they were in the second
quarter of last year. However, gross profit for ESN was largely unchanged, as
slightly lower sales volumes were offset by expanded per tonne margins, as



lower costs more than offset lower sales prices. Year to date ESN sales
volumes and gross profit are both higher compared to 2008.

Gross profit for Advanced Technologies was $17-million for the quarter,
compared with $20-million for the same period last year, while EBITDA was
$12-million, a decrease of $3-million versus the comparable period in 2008.
The reduction in EBITDA was due to weaker demand and margins from a number of
our controlled-release products other than ESN, due to lower housing starts
and a depressed economy. In the second quarter, ESN accounted for 35 percent
of Advanced Technologies' gross profit, an increase from the 29 percent in
the same period last year.

Other

EBIT for our Other non-operating business unit for the second quarter of 2009
was $37-million, an increase of $132-million over the loss of $95-million for
the second quarter of 2008. EBIT for Other for the first half of 2009 was
$17-million, an increase of $130-million over the loss of $113-million for
the same period of 2008. The increases in EBIT for the second quarter and
first half of 2009 reflected a significant decrease in stock-based
compensation expense driven by lower increases in our share price in the
corresponding periods of 2009 and recognition of gross profit deferred by
Wholesale in 2008 on the sales of products to Retail now sold to external
customers in 2009.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities was $199-million in the second quarter
of 2009, compared with cash used in operating activities of $317-million in
the same period of 2008. Cash provided by operating activities was
$271-million in the first half of 2009, a $198-million increase from the same
period of last year. Driving this quarter change was the unusually high
change in non-cash working capital that occurred in the second quarter of
2008 when inventory increased significantly reflecting the price escalation
that occurred in the agricultural sector last spring and a significant
reduction in prepaid expenses and deposits. This was partially offset by a
$266-million decrease in net earnings and a $343-million non-cash decrease in
future income tax liabilities. Driving the year-over-year change was a
$0.9-billion increase in non-cash working capital due to a significant
reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, in addition to a decrease in unrealized gain on derivative
financial instruments. This was partially offset by a $521-million decrease
in net earnings and a $360-million non-cash decrease in future income tax
liabilities.

Below is a summary of our inventory balances as at June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008:

============================================================================


Cash used in investing activities decreased by $2.7-billion in the second
quarter and first half of 2009 both primarily due to the UAP acquisition in
the second quarter of 2008 and lower capital expenditures in the first half
of 2009.

Cash provided by financing activities was $74-million in the second quarter
of 2009 compared with $1.6-billion in the same period of 2008. Cash used in
financing activities was $127-million in the first half of 2009, compared
with cash provided by financing of $1.6-billion in the same period of 2008.
The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes reflected the issuance of
long-term debt and bank indebtedness of $1.2-billion used to finance the UAP
acquisition in the second quarter of 2008 and a pay-down of our bank
indebtedness in the first half of 2009.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently,
quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. Sales are
concentrated in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced
inventories are accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally
occur after the planting seasons in North and South America. In addition, our
acquisition of UAP on May 5, 2008 impacts the comparability of quarterly
results.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 25, 2009, Agrium submitted a proposal to the board of directors
of CF to acquire all of the capital stock of CF for cash and Agrium shares at
$72.00 per CF share, or a total of approximately $3.6-billion, based on the



closing price of Agrium shares on February 24, 2009. Agrium would fund the
cash portion through available liquidity and committed financing. The board
of directors of CF rejected Agrium's proposal on March 9, 2009.

On March 16, 2009, Agrium commenced an exchange offer for all of the
outstanding shares of CF (the "Offer"), pursuant to which CF stockholders
would receive $31.70 in cash plus one common share of Agrium for each CF
share. The Offer is subject to a number of conditions, including the
negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and regulatory approvals under
Canadian and U.S. antitrust legislation. The Canadian Competition Bureau and
the Federal Trade Commission (United States) are reviewing the transaction.
On March 27, 2009, Agrium announced an increase in the cash portion to
$35.00, for an aggregate consideration of $1.8 billion in cash and 50.2
million shares. On May 11, 2009, Agrium announced an increase in the cash
portion to $40.00 for an aggregate cash consideration not to exceed $2.01
billion. The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire on August 19, 2009,
unless extended. The CF board of directors has rejected the Offer.

Agrium is fully committed to acquiring CF and intends to continue to press
the board of directors of CF to execute a mutually beneficial merger
agreement for our respective shareholders. Agrium has had extensive
discussions with CF shareholders, who have advised Agrium that they favour a
combination between Agrium and CF and want the CF board to engage in
discussions with us. Agrium is prepared to increase its Offer further if CF
can demonstrate additional value.

The rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") do not require that we obtain
the approval of our shareholders, but the TSX has the discretion to require
us to obtain shareholder approval. During February 2009, we acquired 1.2
million shares of CF at an average cost of $52.34 for the total consideration
of $65-million, the maximum allowed under FTC regulations. The shares are
classified for accounting purposes as available for sale financial
instruments with changes to the fair value being recorded in other
comprehensive income. At June 30, 2009, the fair value of the CF shares was
$92-million.

EGYPT NITROGEN PROJECT

In the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with MOPCO,
whereby MOPCO would acquire EAgrium and all related contractual obligations
through a share exchange. The share exchange was completed on January 26,
2009, which resulted in our owning 26 percent of MOPCO. We account for our
investment in MOPCO in the Wholesale business unit using the equity method.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS ("IFRS")

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' Accounting Standards Board
has published its strategic plan for convergence of Canadian generally
accepted accounting standards with IFRS as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board. The changeover date for Canadian publicly
accountable enterprises is January 1, 2011 and will require restatement of
comparative figures.

Agrium is currently in the design and development phase of its IFRS
transition plan. To date, progress remains on plan for a successful IFRS
implementation.



At this time, the full impact of transitioning to IFRS on the Company's
future financial position and future operational results is not reasonably
determinable or estimable. We continue to assess the available transitional
exemption options along with the accounting policies under IFRS and the
resulting impacts.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the
primary measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to
EBIT (net earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net
earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization
and asset impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of
performance because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not
synonymous and we believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the
comparability of historical performance for the different business segments.
Similarly, financing and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all
business segments on a basis that is meaningful for comparison with other
companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA
should not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating
activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net earnings as
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

BUSINESS RISKS

The information presented on business risks on pages 85 - 90 in our 2008
Annual Report has not changed materially since December 31, 2008.

CONTROLS & PROCEDURES

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the six months ended June 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

A second consecutive year of delayed corn and soybean planting in the U.S.
Corn Belt led to a high level of volatility in grain and oilseed prices
during the second quarter. Grain prices came under pressure following the
completion of spring planting and pressured further when the USDA reported
significantly higher than expected corn and soybean planted area at the end
of June. Prices have stabilized since then, but significant uncertainty
remains with respect to global grain and oilseed production and prices for
2009/10 at this early stage of the year. The USDA is currently forecasting
that global grain ending stocks will increase slightly. This assumes normal
yields globally, although weather and crop nutrient levels will play an
important role in determining final yields. Dry weather has hampered grain
production in Western Canada and Argentina, leading to the lowest planted
area of wheat in Argentina in recent history. In addition, monsoon rains in
India are below normal for the first two months of the growing season. The
significant reduction in global fertilizer use this past year is expected to
have some impact on yield potential this year and could result in potential
nutrient deficiencies for 2010/11, which could lead to higher than normal
application rates starting this fall.

Wet spring weather delayed demand for crop protection products in North
America this year but higher corn acreage provided solid demand for seed and
most crop protection products. The one exception was lower demand for
glyphosate based products this spring. We expect retail demand for glyphosate
to improve in the second half of the year after declining 19 percent in the
first half of 2009. Stronger than historical grain prices and crop margins
are expected to support continued growth in the seed and crop protection
product lines into the next crop year.

The outlook globally for urea and ammonia markets appears stable as producers
are comfortable with their bookings through August. This has been supported
by increased demand from India, Pakistan and Brazil and seasonal turnaround
at a number of facilities internationally. Urea prices in the U.S. Gulf have
increased 20 percent since May, and have returned to a point where the U.S.
has become an attractive market for imports. U.S. urea imports for the first
five months of 2009 were down 11 percent from 2008 levels, which have
contributed to tight U.S. inventory levels. Chinese export taxes on urea are
currently 10 percent and will remain at that level until September 15, at
which time they are expected to increase to 110 percent until the end of



October. Chinese offer prices have increased in parallel with global prices
and are currently acting as a cap on the market. The UAN market may
experience additional pressure relative to urea prices in late 2009 as the
new Trinidad UAN facility is expected to come on-stream at that time. At
current crude oil prices, European formula-based natural gas prices will
increase in the fourth quarter which could put upward pressure on nitrogen
prices.

The delay in 2009 contracts between major potash producers and Chinese and
Indian buyers created considerable uncertainty in the marketplace, resulting
in many other buyers delaying their purchasing decisions. As a result,
producers have continued to reduce capacity utilization. In the first six
months of 2009, TFI reported North American potash production was down over
60 percent from the high rates in 2008, and North American inventory levels
were at historically high levels at the end of June. Recent contract
agreements between India and global potash producers have been concluded at
prices significantly below 2008 contract values. This is expected to
influence benchmark prices for the near term but has provided additional
clarity on prices to the market. As a result, demand is expected to improve
in the second half of 2009 and rebound strongly in 2010. There continues to
be uncertainty with respect to both volumes and price of 2009 potash
contracts with China.

Global phosphate markets have recently shown some signs of stabilizing. The
TFI reported U.S. DAP/MAP June inventory levels were 9 percent below the five
year average and only 4 percent above 2008 levels. Apparent wholesale DAP/MAP
disappearance in the U.S. was down 37 percent in the 2008/09 fertilizer year
compared to the previous year. We anticipate global and North American demand
will continue to recover in the second half of 2009 and into 2010. India is
still expected to purchase additional import volumes in the second half of
2009 and South American import demand is expected to continue to improve. The
reduction in Chinese export taxes to 10 percent has been extended through
August, but at current market prices, China is not expected to be a major
factor in the export market. A risk to the phosphate market is a build in
exportable Chinese inventories when the export tax is increased, which could
cap the market in November when the export tax is again reduced.
