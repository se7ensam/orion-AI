 Exhibit 99.1  

  AEGON repays one third of government support  THE HAGUE - AEGON yesterday repaid one third of the EUR 3 billion in core capital the company secured last year through its largest shareholder, Vereniging AEGON and funded by the Dutch government. AEGON
first announced its intention to repay the Dutch government in August when it raised EUR 1 billion in a successful equity issue.  The total
payment to the Dutch government amounts to EUR 1.15 billion. Under the terms of AEGON’s agreement with the Dutch government, the premium for repayment amounted to EUR 108 million based on the volume weighted average share price of AEGON
shares of EUR 4.8315 during the five trading days from November 23 until November 27. The amount repaid includes accrued interest from May 22, 2009 of EUR 44 million.  Repayment of the initial EUR 1 billion to the Dutch government is an important first step toward full repayment of the core capital funded by the Dutch government.
