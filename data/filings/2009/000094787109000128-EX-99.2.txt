    [Reasons
for the above Earnings Forecast]
    The
Company did not disclose the consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2009 due to the difficulty involved in forecasting trends in
the demand for semiconductors and investment plans for semiconductor related
capital expenditures.  However, the Company is able to disclose the
consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, taking
into forecast factors such as recent trends in orders input received and the
implementation of corporate restructuring aimed at improving
earnings.  Accordingly, the relevant consolidated earnings forecast
are as above.
    With
respect to the Company’s future operating
environment, movements towards substantial reduction or postponement of capital
expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers have become more pronounced, and the
Company anticipates that the operating environment will continue to be extremely
difficult.  Corporate restructuring expenses, including impairment
loss on fixed assets corresponding to future reduction or weakness in the
market, are included as operating expense in the forecast set forth
above.  The Company also anticipates that it will increase the
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in income taxes.

      [Reasons
for the above Revisions]
      The
Company's policy with respect to dividends is that, while aiming to make
consistent distributions, because of the fluctuation of the market in which it
operates, the Company makes dividend payouts following a target payout ratio of
20% or more.
      Because
the consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 set
forth above are expected to be difficult, the Company is forecasting a year-end
dividend of 5 yen per share.
