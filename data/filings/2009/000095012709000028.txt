Attached herewith as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release, dated February 4, 2009,
whereby Acergy S.A. (the "Company") announced that it will release its fourth
quarter and full year results on Wednesday February 18, 2009. A conference call

The attached press release shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section
18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the
liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in
any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set
forth by specific reference in such filing.

Certain statements set forth above and contained in the press release furnished
pursuant to this Form 6-K may include "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use
of words like "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may,"
"plan," "project," "will," "should," "seek," and similar expressions. The
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding
the expected timing of the conference call regarding the Company's fourth
quarter and full year results and the expected participants of that conference
call. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions
and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others
which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and
future results and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking
statements: our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general
economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we
operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and
administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in
operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely
completion of ship conversion programs; the impact of laws and regulations; and
operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these
factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you
should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.
