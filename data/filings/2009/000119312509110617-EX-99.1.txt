Press Release

 

 Exhibit 99.1  

  Embedded value of EUR 11.35 per share  The embedded value 2008, as reported today, demonstrates both stable performance of the in-force book, as well as continued successful focus on profitable new business. Management considers embedded value to be an
additional measure for shareholders to value the existing business of the company.  Alex Wynaendts, CEO, said: “Despite the difficult operating
environment in 2008, AEGON performed satisfactorily on the in-force book and well on new business. The decrease in embedded value primarily reflects equity market falls, an increase in the risk premium used to set the discount rate and the impact of
widening credit spreads in combination with lower assumed fixed interest returns.”  The embedded value life insurance (EVLI) was down to EUR 23
billion. The EVLI benefited from the increased value of new business of EUR 0.8 billion and the performance of the in-force book of EUR 0.9 billion. However, this was offset by lower than expected investment returns of EUR 3.2 billion, a change in
economic assumptions of EUR 2 billion and negative currency translation effects of EUR 0.3 billion.  Free surplus on the life insurance business at
year-end was up to EUR 2.3 billion with limited net capital injections of EUR 0.5 billion. Considering the economic turmoil in 2008, the embedded value operating margin remained fairly stable at 6.8%, driven by new business in the UK and
Central & Eastern Europe.  At year-end 2008, the total embedded value amounted to EUR 18.5 billion, a decrease of 15% compared to 2007. Adjusted
for the value of AEGON preferred shares, the total embedded value per common share amounted to EUR 11.35, a decrease of 16%.

community to evaluate AEGON’s business relative to the businesses of our peers.  Local currencies and constant currency exchange rates
