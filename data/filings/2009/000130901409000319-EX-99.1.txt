Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, Inc., said,
“As we expected, market demand for recruitment services in the first quarter was significantly
impacted by the global economic crisis and the slowdown of the Chinese economy. However, through
cost control and financial discipline, we were able to maintain our track record of profitability
and achieve better than forecasted earnings in the first quarter. We believe the measures we are
currently undertaking to streamline our processes, increase productivity and more effectively
allocate resources will strengthen our operations and position us for greater profitability and
growth when market conditions improve.”

First Quarter 2009 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009 were RMB178.3 million (US$26.1 million),
a decrease of 24.6% from RMB236.4 million for the same quarter in 2008.


Print advertising revenues for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 42.4% to RMB70.6 million
(US$10.3 million) compared with RMB122.4 million for the same quarter in 2008. The decrease was
primarily due to fewer print advertising pages in 51job Weekly, which was impacted by a decline in
market demand resulting from the global economic crisis and slowdown of the Chinese economy during
the first quarter of 2009. The estimated number of print advertising pages generated in the first
quarter of 2009 decreased 36.5% to 2,916 compared with 4,593 pages in the same quarter in 2008.
Print advertising prices charged in each city were relatively unchanged compared to the first
quarter of 2008, but average revenue per page decreased 9.2% due to a greater contribution of
advertising volume from lower priced cities.


Online recruitment services revenues for the first quarter of 2009 were RMB68.2 million (US$10.0
million), representing a 13.0% decrease from RMB78.4 million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The decrease was primarily due to lower average revenue per unique employer, which was
partially offset by an increase in the number of unique employers using the Company’s online
recruitment services. Average revenue per unique employer decreased 17.4% in the first quarter of
2009 compared to the same quarter in 2008 as employers reduced expenditures for online recruitment
products and/or chose lower priced products. Unique employers using the Company’s online
recruitment services increased 5.3% to 63,684 in the first quarter of 2009 compared with 60,461 in
the same quarter of the prior year.


Other human resource related revenues for the first quarter of 2009 increased 10.9% to RMB39.5
million (US$5.8 million) from RMB35.6 million in the same quarter of 2008 principally due to
greater customer demand for human resource outsourcing services, which was partially offset by
lower revenues from executive search and training services.


Gross profit for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 24.1% to RMB94.7 million (US$13.9 million)
from RMB124.8 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is equal to
gross profit divided by net revenues, improved to 56.1% in the first quarter of 2009 compared with
55.7% in the same quarter in 2008 primarily due to lower printing related expenses and cost
control.


Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 3.8% to RMB83.0 million (US$12.1
million) from RMB86.2 million for the same quarter of 2008 due to lower sales and marketing
expenses, which was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 49.2% for the first quarter of 2009 compared with
38.5% for the first quarter of 2008. Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 45.4% in the first quarter of 2009 compared with 36.1%
in the first quarter of 2008.


Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 10.4% to RMB49.6 million
(US$7.3 million) from RMB55.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to a
decrease in advertising and promotion expenses, which was partially offset by higher salary and
benefits expenses resulting from a greater number of staff employed as compared to the same quarter
in 2008.


General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2009 increased 8.1% to RMB33.3 million
(US$4.9 million) from RMB30.8 million in the first quarter of 2008, which was mainly attributable
to higher rental expenses, property management fees and share-based compensation expense.


Income from operations for the first quarter of 2009 decreased to RMB11.7 million (US$1.7 million)
from RMB38.6 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The Company’s effective tax rate was
39.5% in the first quarter of 2009 compared with 35.9% in the first quarter of the prior year as
certain non-tax deductible expenses, including share-based compensation, comprised a higher portion
of the taxable income base.


Net income for the first quarter of 2009 decreased to RMB9.4 million (US$1.4 million) from RMB22.2
million for the same quarter in 2008. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the first
quarter of 2009 were RMB0.17 (US$0.02) compared with RMB0.39 for the same quarter in 2008. Fully
diluted earnings per ADS for the first quarter of 2009 were RMB0.34 (US$0.05) compared with RMB0.78
in the first quarter of 2008.


In the first quarter of 2009, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB7.6 million (US$1.1 million) compared with RMB6.3 million in the first quarter of 2008. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation gain of RMB31 thousand (US$5 thousand) in
the first quarter of 2009 due to the slight depreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar,
compared with a translation loss of RMB10.3 million in the first quarter of 2008.


Excluding share-based compensation expense and the impact of foreign currency translation, non-GAAP
adjusted income for the first quarter of 2009 decreased to RMB17.0 million (US$2.5 million) from
RMB38.8 million for the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per common
share were RMB0.30 (US$0.04) in the first quarter of 2009 compared with RMB0.68 in the first
quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per ADS in the first quarter of 2009
were RMB0.60 (US$0.09) compared with RMB1.37 in the first quarter of 2008.


In September 2008, the Company announced that its shareholders had approved a share repurchase
program authorizing the repurchase of up to US$25 million worth of outstanding ADSs. In the first
quarter of 2009, the Company repurchased 236,020 ADSs, representing 472,040 common shares, in the
open market for an aggregate consideration of US$1.6 million, including transaction fees.


As of March 31, 2009, the Company had cash and short-term investments totaling RMB1,086.3 million
(US$159.0 million) compared with RMB1,074.4 million at December 31, 2008.


Business Outlook


For the second quarter of 2009, based on current market and operating conditions, the Company’s
revenue target is in the estimated range of RMB175 million to RMB185 million (US$25.6 million to
US$27.1 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense and any foreign currency translation
loss or gain, the Company’s non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the second quarter of 2009
is in the estimated range of RMB0.22 to RMB0.32 per common share (US$0.06 to US$0.09 per ADS). The
Company expects aggregate share-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2009 to be in
the estimated range of RMB7 to RMB8 million (US$1.0 million to US$1.2 million).


Currency Convenience Translation


For the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars at
the rate of RMB6.8329 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi
per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board,
as of March 31, 2009.


Conference Call Information


Management of 51job will host a conference call at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 11, 2009 (9:00

call will be available live and on replay through 51job’s investor relations website, ir.51job.com.
Please go to the website at least fifteen minutes early to register or install any necessary audio
software. Participants may also dial into the teleconference at +1-877-856-1964 (+1-719-325-4780
for international callers) and provide the passcode 4361812. An audio replay of the conference

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of adjusted net
income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from
results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and foreign
currency translation gain or loss. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company’s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company’s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss from its non-GAAP
financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation gain or loss is
unrelated to the Company’s core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor
impact the Company’s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP measures excluding
share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss are important in
helping investors to understand the Company’s current financial performance and future prospects
and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The
presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to
GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The
non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.

operating results constitute “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon management’s current expectations, and actual
results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are
