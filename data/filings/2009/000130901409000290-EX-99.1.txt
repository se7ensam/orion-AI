Ballard Reports First Quarter 2009 Results


For Immediate Release – April 28, 2009


VANCOUVER, CANADA– Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDP) announced its results for the
first quarter ended March 31, 2009 today. All amounts are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.


“Our first quarter results are generally consistent with the outlook provided in January, with weak
product shipments and revenue in Q1, expected to ramp up over the back half of the year,” said John
Sheridan, President and CEO. He added, “While the negative macroeconomic backdrop is presenting
clear risks to Ballard’s 15-30% revenue growth target, we still view this type of growth as
attainable, but given the risks in the environment, more likely to the low end of this range.”


The company also confirmed its full year guidance for:






     
    •
     
    Total product shipments: 4,000 units (115% growth from 2008)









     
    •
     
    Operating cash consumption1: $17 million to $27 million (7% to 40% reduction
from 2008)





First Quarter 2009 Overview






     
    •
     
    Total Product Shipments of 192 units, a decrease from 284 units in Q1 2008.









     
    •
     
    Shipments expected to ramp up over the back half of the year.









     
    •
     
    FCgenTM-1300 development program is on track for Indian market deployment.









     
    •

consortium starting in August 2009.









     
    •
     
    Key progress in material handling, with lift truck fleet conversions by Plug Power for
Central Grocers and Nestlé Waters.









     
    •
     
    Organizational restructuring completed, resulting in a 7% workforce reduction with

First Quarter 2009 Financial Highlights






     
    •
     
    Revenue was $8.1 million (Q1 2008: $16.0 million).









     
    •
     
    Product and service revenues for the core Fuel Cell Products segment of $3.9
million were consistent with the prior year quarter.









     
    •
     
    The overall year over year quarterly decline was primarily driven by:









     
    •
     
    The slow down in the automotive sector and its impact on Contract
Automotive and Material Products revenues; and









     
    •
     
    The decline in engineering development revenues due primarily to the
elimination of automotive fuel cell development work subsequent to the
closing of the AFCC transaction and completion of the 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell development program, both in 2008.









     
    •
     
    Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization decreased $3.4 million.









     
    •
     
    Research and product development decreased $3.8 million to $7.8 million.









     
    •
     
    Sales and Marketing flat at $1.8 million.









     
    •
     
    General and Administrative increased $0.4 million to $4.3 million, which
includes $1.1 million in severance expense related to the 7% workforce reduction.









     
    •
     
    Operating cash consumption1 was $11.0 million, a 20% increase from $9.2
million in the first quarter of 2008.









     
    •
     
    Net Loss was ($18.6) million or ($0.22) loss per share, a decrease of $99.6 million from
Q1 2008 net income of $81.0 million. 2008 net income included a $97 million gain from the
sale of our automotive assets.









     
    •
     
    Normalized net loss1 was ($17.5) million or ($0.21) per share, representing
a $1.6 million increase in loss from Q1 2008 ($15.9 million) driven by lower margins and
engineering development revenues, partially offset by reductions in operating expenses.









     
    •
     
    Cash reserves of $66.7 million and debt-free balance sheet.





First Quarter 2009 Financial Results


Ballard’s revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased to $8.1 million, or 50%,
compared to $16.0 million for the first quarter of 2008 due primarily to the continuing slowdown
in the automotive sector negatively impacting the supporting business segments. Contract
Automotive and Material Products revenues were down $5.6 million due to lower shipments of
light-duty automotive modules and carbon friction material products combined with the elimination
of light-duty automotive fuel cell program work subsequent to the closing of the AFCC Transaction
on January 31, 2008 (the “AFCC Transaction”). In addition, Fuel Cell Products engineering
development revenues were down $2.3 million due primarily to the completion of the 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell development program in the third quarter of 2008. In the core Fuel Cell
Products segment, product and service revenues of $3.9 million were essentially flat versus the
prior year quarter of $4.0 million.


Ballard’s net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2009 increased to $18.6 million, or
($0.22) per share, compared with net income of $81.0 million, or $0.87 per share, in the first
quarter of 2008. The first quarter net income in 2008 included a gain on sale of assets of $96.9
million related to the AFCC Transaction. The first quarter net loss in 2009 included severance and
related costs of $1.1 million relating to a 7% workforce reduction initiated in March 2009.


Ballard’s normalized net loss1 for the first quarter of 2009 increased $1.6 million to
$17.5 million, or ($0.21) per share, compared with a normalized net loss of $15.9 million, or
($0.17) per share, for 2008. Product and service revenue and related gross margin declines of $4.0
million and $1.7 million, respectively, combined with lower engineering development revenues of
$3.9 million, were only partially offset by reductions in operating expenses of $4.5 million. In
addition, declines in investment and other income of $1.1 million negatively impacted normalized
net loss in 2009 as compared to 2008.


Operating cash consumption1 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 increased 20% to
$11.0 million, compared to $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2008. The higher operating cash
consumption in the first quarter of 2009 was driven by increased capital expenditures, a decline
in investment income, lower product and service gross margins and lower engineering development
revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower working capital requirements and lower
operating expenses.

Endnotes:

1 Normalized net loss and operating cash consumption are non-GAAP measures used to
assist in assessing Ballard’s financial performance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar
measures presented by other companies. Normalized net loss measures Ballard’s net loss after
excluding items that are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal continued operating
activity of the business. Gains on sale of assets held for sale, losses from discontinued
operations, write-downs of long-lived assets and severance and related costs are not considered
part of Ballard’s core activities, and are either unusual or are expected to occur infrequently.
Therefore Ballard removes these in the calculation of normalized net loss. Operating cash
consumption measures the amount of cash required to fund the operating activities of Ballard’s
business and excludes financing and investing activities except for net additions to property,
plant and equipment.
