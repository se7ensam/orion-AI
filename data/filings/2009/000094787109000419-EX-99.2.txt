    Message to
Shareholders
     
    To Our
Shareholders
     
    We are
pleased to send you our “Report for the 67th Fiscal Year (from April 1, 2008 to
March 31, 2009).”
     
    In the
semiconductor-related market, excess inventory and price pressures persisted
since the previous fiscal year and the anticipated demand during this fiscal
year for desktop high performance PC replacements, as well as demand for home
electronics ahead of the Beijing Olympics, fell short of
expectations.  Furthermore, ripple effects of the financial crisis in
the U.S. spread to Europe and to emerging markets in Southeast Asia and
elsewhere, which had previously been stable.  These factors reinforced
the defensive stance of semiconductor manufacturers, many of whom implemented
production cuts and froze or postponed their capital expenditure
programs.
     
    In
response to these dramatic changes in the environment, Advantest actively cut
costs throughout the fiscal year, and implemented emergency measures in November
2008, which included reduction of fixed costs such as reduction of the workforce
and reduced compensation for directors, corporate auditors, executive officers
and managers.  However, the business climate continued to deteriorate
once entering 2009 and Advantest responded with follow-on measures by reviewing
underperforming product lines, aiming for further workforce optimization through
acceptance of voluntary retirement from full-time employees and other measures
as its planned structural reforms.
     
    However,
orders input received and net sales declined steeply compared to the previous
fiscal year.  Accordingly, orders input received decreased by 69.1%
from the previous fiscal year to ¥50.1 billion, net sales decreased by 58.1%
from the previous fiscal year to ¥76.7 billion, operating loss was ¥49.5
billion, loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated company was
¥52.8 billion, and net loss was ¥74.9 billion.
     
    Despite
economic and employment stimulus packages recently announced by many countries
to counter the global economic slowdown, the timing of the recovery remains
uncertain and visibility is still limited.  In the
semiconductor-related market, trends in demand for end-user products including
automobiles, mobile phones, and consumer electronics remain uncertain and the
possibility of significant changes still lies ahead with restructuring underway
in the semiconductor industry.  Thus, Advantest refrains from making
any predictions on the timing of the recovery of capital
expenditures.
     
    In this
operating environment, in addition to the measures already implemented,
Advantest will focus on deriving efficiency gains in its research and
development and manufacturing processes by consolidating subsidiaries, reducing
fixed costs through consolidation and closing of business offices and other
facilities, improving productivity of in-house processes, and reinforcing the
Advantest Group’s sales structure.  Furthermore, Advantest will
implement measures to enable it to take full advantage of the next upturn in the
market, including implementing organizational reform to complement restructuring
undertaken by its customers, reinforcing global service networks and developing
new products and entering into new businesses.
     
    With
respect to the dividend distribution to the shareholders, Advantest resolved at
the meeting of the Board of Directors held on May 26, 2009 to distribute a year
end dividend of 5 yen per share, with a payment date of June 2,
2009.  Since Advantest has paid an interim dividend of 25 yen, the
total dividend per share for the fiscal year will be 30 yen per share.

     
    We hope
that we may rely on you for your continued support and guidance in the
future.

Report
     
    (April 1,
2008 through March 31, 2009)

Conditions of the Advantest Group
     
    (1)         Business
conditions during the fiscal year
     
    (i)  Operations
and Results of Business
     
    Overall
     
    In the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the global economy saw a continued
deceleration during the first half of the fiscal year due to the expansion of
the sub-prime loan crisis in the U.S., and the Lehman shock in September 2008
further aggravated the financial crisis and accelerated the rapid deterioration
of the global economy.
    In the
semiconductor-related market, although excess inventory and price pressures
persisted since the previous fiscal year, many hoped at the beginning of this
fiscal year that desktop high performance PC replacements, as well as demand for
home electronics ahead of the Beijing Olympics, would drive an upturn in the
market. However, growth in demand fell short of expectations, and semiconductor
manufacturers continued to take a cautious stance on capital expenditures,
prolonging Advantest’s extremely difficult business environment.
    Furthermore,
ripple effects of the financial crisis in the U.S. spread to Europe and to
emerging markets in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, which had previously been
stable. Decreasing demand for end-user products reinforced the defensive stance
of semiconductor manufacturers, many of whom implemented production cuts and
froze or postponed their capital expenditure programs starting from the second
half of the fiscal year.
    In
response to these dramatic changes in the environment, Advantest actively cut
costs throughout the fiscal year, and also implemented emergency measures to
improve profitability in November 2008. These measures included reduction of
fixed costs such as, reduction of the workforce, and reduced compensation for
directors, corporate auditors, executive officers and managers. However, the
business climate continued to deteriorate in 2009 and Advantest responded with
further measures by reviewing underperforming product lines, acceptance of
voluntary retirement from full-time employees and among others, aiming for
further workforce optimization as its planned structural reforms.
    However,
orders input received and net sales declined steeply compared to the previous
fiscal year, causing Advantest to recognize inventory valuation losses of ¥8.7
billion, restructuring costs of ¥5.1 billion, impairment loss on property,
plant, and equipment of ¥13.8 billion and a valuation allowance on deferred tax
assets of ¥45.1 billion.
    Accordingly,
orders input received decreased by 69.1% from the previous fiscal year to ¥50.1
billion, net sales decreased by 58.1% from the previous fiscal year to ¥76.7
billion, operating loss was ¥49.5 billion, loss before income taxes and equity
in loss of affiliated company was ¥52.8 billion, and net loss was ¥74.9
billion.  Furthermore, Advantest’s overseas sales ratio fell to 67.7%,
compared to 69.3% in the previous fiscal year.
    
     
    Business
conditions by Business Segment
     
    Semiconductor
and Component Test System Segment
     
    In the
Semiconductor and Component Test Systems segment, the semiconductor downturn
combined with global economic fears sharply curbed capital spending by major
manufacturers.  Accordingly, Advantest’s results for both memory and
non-memory test systems remained weak.
    In the
memory sector, the delay of the anticipated transition to DDR3-DRAM
semiconductors for high-performance computers, coupled with the continuous
oversupply held down prices of DDR2-DRAM, and semiconductor manufacturers
restrained investment in DRAM test systems.  Demand for flash memory
semiconductors were also weak caused by oversupply, and in addition, falling
sales of mobile phones placed pressure on prices, causing capital expenditures
in flash memory test systems to remain weak.
    In the
non-memory sector, strong sales of notebooks and other mobile PCs were recorded
in the first half of the fiscal year, and signs of increase in production were
seen among the semiconductor manufacturers in related
fields.  However, the demand associated with the Beijing Olympics fell
short of expectations and a recovery in capital expenditures. Moreover, the
worldwide decline in consumer confidence suppressed demand for products using
semiconductors, leading to a continued weak demand in test systems for consumer,
automotive and LCD driver ICs.

    As a result of the above, orders input
received in the Semiconductor and Component Test System segment was ¥26.1
billion, a 77.4% decrease in comparison to the previous fiscal year. Net sales
were ¥49.2 billion, a 62.6% decrease in comparison to the previous fiscal year,
and operating loss was
¥28.9 billion.
     
     
    Mechatronics
System Segment
     
    The low
market demand for memory and non-memory test systems also weakened demand for
test handlers and device interface products, which are used together with test
systems. In particular, the downturn in the DRAM semiconductor market produced a
dramatic decline in demand for back-end test handlers.
    As a
result of the above, orders input received in the Mechatronics System segment
was ¥9.1 billion (a 69.9% decrease in comparison to the previous fiscal year).
Net sales were ¥14.4 billion (a 58.8% decrease in comparison to the previous
fiscal year) and operating loss was ¥11.9 billion.
     
     
    Services,
Support and Others Segment
     
    The
decline in demand for maintenance services, weak performance in the
semiconductor market, and the decline in demand for maintenance and other
services caused, orders input received in the Services, Support and Others
segment to decline to ¥15.6 billion (a 19.1% decrease in comparison to the
previous fiscal year). Net sales were ¥15.8 billion (a 18.2% decrease in
comparison to the previous fiscal year) and operating loss was ¥1.1
billion.

                  “Basic
      net income per share” for fiscal year 2005 is calculated on the assumption
      that a one to two stock split on October 1, 2006 was made at the beginning
      of the fiscal year.

              The
      calculation of “Basic net income per share” was based on the average
      number of shares issued during the relevant fiscal year reduced by the
      average number of treasury shares held during the fiscal
    year.

    (4)    Challenges
Ahead
     
    While
maintaining “Measurements” as our core competence in the mid-to-long-term, the
Advantest Group intends to improve its corporate value by establishing a
management and financial structure that responds timely to changes in the global
market.  Specifically, the Advantest Group will aim to increase market
share by introducing fine products that will inspire the market demands of the
next generation.  To achieve these objectives, the Advantest Group
promotes to further strengthen its product development operations, improve
production efficiency, focus on certain businesses, strengthen its overseas
operations and support system in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
    Confronting
deepening capital spending cuts by semiconductor manufacturers and the
likelihood of Advantest’s operating environment remaining weak for a prolonged
period, the Advantest Group has implemented initiatives for structural reforms
to reinforce management structure.  Such measures include workforce
optimization, the integration of four manufacturing subsidiaries, the likewise
integration of four software subsidiaries, ongoing review of underperforming
business segments, exploration of and investment into new businesses, payroll
cost reductions, and the consolidation and closing of offices and other
facilities.
    Through
“Activate 21,” a corporate initiative launched in October 2005, the Advantest
Group has pursued greater efficiency, cost savings and financial health from a
global perspective. The initiative concluded in March 2009, with positive
results including productivity improvements from reinforcements made to the
just-in-time (“JIT”) production system, inventory optimization, and
standardization of design specifications leading to enhanced development
efficiency. The Advantest Group’s new corporate initiative, starting from fiscal
year 2009, will incorporate detailed measures and goals to be applied once the
structural reforms that the Advantest Group is currently conducting are
completed.

services and related services in the business category of “Services, Support and
Others.”

                                                    Reasons
      for the Company’s acquisition of the stock acquisition
    rights
                                                  
                                                  
                                                    (a)  
      The Company may acquire, for no consideration, any stock acquisition right
      in the event that the general meeting of the shareholders resolves to
      approve (i) any merger agreement pursuant to which the Company shall cease
      to exist, or (ii) any share exchange agreement or share transfer pursuant
      to which the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of another
      company.
                                                     
                                                    (b)  
      The Company may acquire, for no consideration, all or part of the stock
      acquisition rights owned by a rights holder to the extent that such stock
      acquisition rights are not exercisable due to the rights holder’s failure
      to satisfy any of the conditions to exercise stock acquisition
      rights.
                                                  
                                                  The Company shall
      automatically acquire the stock acquisition rights, for no consideration,
      if: 

                                                    (a)      the
      general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve (if approval by the
      shareholders’ meeting is not legally required, then the Board of Directors
      may approve) (i) any merger agreement pursuant to which the Company shall
      dissolve, (ii) any agreement or a plan pursuant to which the Company shall
      split all or part of its business or (iii) any stock-for-stock exchange
      agreement or stock-transfer plan pursuant to which the Company shall
      become a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company;
                                                    (b)      the
      rights holder becomes a person who does not hold any position as a
      director, corporate auditor, executive officer, employee, advisor or
      non-regular employee of the Company or its subsidiaries before the
      expiration of the exercise period, unless the Company otherwise deems it
      appropriate to allow him/her to exercise his/her stock acquisition rights
      and notifies him/her to that effect;
                                                    (c)      the
      rights holder dies.
                                                  
                                                
                                                
                                                  
                                                    Restriction
      on the transfer of the stock acquisition rights
                                                  
                                                  
                                                    Approval
      by the Board of Directors is required to transfer the stock acquisition
      rights, except where the Company is the transferee with respect to such
      transfer.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                    Acquisition
      of the stock acquisition rights by transfer shall require an approval by
      the Board of Directors.  Provided, however, if it is the Company
      acquiring the stock acquisition rights by transfer, such transfer shall be
      deemed to be approved by the Board of
Directors.

              Reasons
      for the Company’s acquisition of the stock acquisition
    rights
            
            
              The
      Company shall automatically acquire the stock acquisition rights, for no
      consideration, if:
              (a)  
      the general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve (if approval by
      the shareholders’ meeting is not legally required, then the Board of
      Directors may approve) (i) any merger agreement pursuant to which the
      Company shall dissolve, (ii) any agreement or a plan pursuant to which the
      Company shall split all or part of its business or (iii) any
      stock-for-stock exchange agreement or stock-transfer plan pursuant to
      which the Company shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of another
      company;
              (b)  
      the rights holder becomes a person who does not hold any position as a
      director, corporate auditor, executive officer, employee, advisor or
      non-regular employee of the Company or its subsidiaries before the
      expiration of the exercise period, unless the Company otherwise deems it
      appropriate to allow him/her to exercise his/her stock acquisition rights
      and notifies him/her to that effect;
              (c)  
      the rights holder dies.
            
          
          
            
              Restriction
      on the transfer of the stock acquisition rights
            
            
              Acquisition
      of the stock acquisition rights by transfer shall require an approval by
      the Board of Directors.  Provided, however, if it is the Company
      acquiring the stock acquisition rights by transfer, such transfer shall be
      deemed to be approved by the Board of
Directors.

      officers while delegating necessary authorities to ensure the prompt and
      efficient performance of duties.

      (6)   Policies
on the distribution of surplus
    
     
    Based on
the premise that long-term and continued growth in corporate value is
fundamental to the creation of shareholder value, the Company deems the
consistent distribution of profits to be the most important management
priority.  Accordingly, the Company engages in active distribution of
profits based on business performance.
     
    With
respect to the distribution of the surplus, the Company makes payout decisions
after taking into consideration business performance, financial conditions, as
well as the need for strategic investment for mid-to-long-term business
development.  While aiming to make consistent distributions, because
of the fluctuation of the market in which it operates, the Company makes
dividend payouts following a target payout ratio of 20% or more.
     
    Retained
earnings are devoted to research and development, streamlining efforts, overseas
expansion, investments in new businesses and resources for M&A activities,
with an aim to strengthen the Company’s business position and enhance its
corporate value.
     
    In order
to maintain capital strategies responsive to changes in the operating
environment, the Company plans to decide obtaining more treasury shares by
taking into account factors such as trends in stock price, capital efficiency
and cash flow.

        (1)  Basis
of Presentation
      
      The
consolidated statutory report including consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of income has been prepared on the basis of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”),
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 120 of the Company
Accounting Regulation (kaisha
keisan kisoku).  Pursuant to the provisions of the article,
however, certain disclosures required on the basis of U.S. GAAP are
omitted.

      of major consolidated subsidiaries are omitted, as they are described in
      “1. Current Conditions of the Advantest Group, (3) Significant
      Subsidiaries” of the Business
Report.
              
            
        
      
       
      
        (3)  Application
of the equity method
      
      
        The

        (4)  Significant
accounting policies
      
      
      (i) Cash
equivalents
      Cash
equivalents consist of deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit due to
mature within 3 months.
       
      (ii)
Inventories
      Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using
the average cost method.
       
      (iii)
Securities
      The
Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investment in Debt and Equity Securities”.
      Available-for-sale
securities are recorded at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses
are accounted for as a separate component of stockholders’
equity.  Cost of other securities sold is determined using the moving
average method.
      Other
securities are accounted for using the acquisition cost method.
       
      (iv)
Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment
      For the
Company and its domestic subsidiaries, depreciation is computed principally
using the declining-balance method, except for buildings which is depreciated
using the straight-line method.  For foreign subsidiaries,
depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.
       
      (v)
Goodwill and other intangible assets
      Under
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill and intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but are instead tested
for impairment at least once a year.  Intangible assets with definite
useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives.
       
      (vi)
Impairment of long-lived assets
      The
Company applies SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets”, which stipulates that the impairment of long-lived fixed
assets or intangible assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization be
recognized when events or changes in their conditions result in non-recovery of
their carrying amounts.  When the carrying amount exceeds the future
recoverable amount, the Company recognizes the difference between the fair value
and the carrying amount as an impairment loss.
       
      
        
          
          
        
        
          23
          
            
          
        
        
          
          
        
      
       
      (vii)
Allowances
      Allowances
for doubtful accounts
      The
Company recognizes allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that trade accounts
receivable are not overstated due to uncollectibility, in an amount which
represents the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses
in the Company’s existing trade accounts receivable.
       
      Accrued
warranty expenses
      To
provide for future repairs during warranty periods, estimated repair expenses
over the warranty period are accrued based on the historical ratio of actual
repair expenses to corresponding sales.
       
      Accrued
pension and severance cost
      In
accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS No.
158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit and Retirement Plans”, the
Company provides for employees’ retirement, severance and pension costs in
accrued amounts based on the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of
plan assets at the balance sheet date.  Unrecognized actuarial loss
and unrecognized prior service cost are amortized by the straight-line method
over the average remaining service periods of employees.
       
      (viii)
Translation of foreign financial statements
      In
accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”, in financial
statements of foreign subsidiaries utilizing local currencies as a functional
currency, assets and liabilities are translated at rates of exchange prevailing
at the end of the fiscal year, profits and expenses are translated at average
rates of exchange in effect during the year, and foreign currency translation
adjustments resulting from the above translation of items are included as other
accumulated comprehensive income (loss).  In financial statements for
foreign subsidiaries utilizing Japanese Yen as the functional currency, the
items are remeasured into Japanese Yen, and any currency translation adjustments
resulting from the above translation of items are included as "Other profits
(expenses)" realized during the period in which the items were
remeasured.
       
      (Accounting
Changes)
       
      In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) which defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value
measurement disclosure.  SFAS 157 does not expand the use of fair
value to any new circumstances, but does require additional disclosures in both
annual and quarterly reports. The Company  adopted SFAS 157 and its
related amendments for financial assets and liabilities on April 1, 2008. The
adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a significant impact on its consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.  The Company will adopt
SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter beginning
April 1, 2009.

      Lease
assets are depreciated using the straight-line method, using the lease period as
the useful life and zero as the residual value.
       
      However,
finance lease transactions not involving a transfer of title to the lessee that
commenced on or prior to March 31, 2008 are accounted for in the same way as
usual operating lease transactions.

                The
      Company has applied the “Accounting Standard for Measurement of
      Inventories” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan Statement No. 9 issued
      July 5, 2006 (“ASBJ 9”)) effective from the current fiscal
      year.  The adoption of ASBJ 9 did not have a material impact on
      the Company’s non-consolidated profit and
loss.

                Effective
      from the current fiscal year, the Company has adopted the “Accounting
      Standard for Lease Transactions” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan
      Statement No. 13 issued June 17, 1993, (First Division of the Business
      Accounting Council), revised March 30, 2007) and the “Implementation
      Guidance on the Accounting Standard for Lease Transactions” (Accounting
      Standards Board of Japan Implementation Guidance No. 16 issued January 18,
      1994, (Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Accounting
      System Committee), revised March 30, 2007).  Accordingly, lease
      transactions are subject to the same accounting treatment used in ordinary
      sales transactions.  Because the Company has no such lease
      transactions that commenced after April 1, 2008 that would necessitate the
      application of the accounting treatment based on ordinary sales
      transactions, the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a
      material impact on the Company’s non-consolidated profit and
      loss.

                    We
      have audited the consolidated financial statements of Advantest
      Corporation (the “Company”) for its 67th fiscal year (April 1, 2008
      through March 31, 2009), including the consolidated balance sheets,
      consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of
      stockholders’ equity, and notes to consolidated financial statements, for
      the purpose of reporting under the provisions of Article 444, Paragraph 4
      of the “Company Law.”  The management of the Company was
      responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial
      statements, and our responsibility shall be limited to the expression of
      an independent opinion regarding the consolidated financial
      statements.
                     
                    We
      conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
      accepted in Japan.  These auditing standards require reasonable
      assurance that the consolidated financial statements do not contain any
      untrue statements of material fact.  The audit was conducted
      based on an audit by testing, and included a review of the consolidated
      financial statements as a whole and an evaluation of the accounting
      policies adopted by the management, the application thereof, and the
      estimates prepared by the management.  We believe that we have
      obtained a reasonable basis to form our opinion as a result of the
      audit.
                     
                    In
      our opinion, the consolidated financial statements properly present the
      financial position and the results of operations during the fiscal year,
      in all material respects, of the company group consisting of Advantest
      Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
      (Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” “1. Notes
      to significant matters based on which the Consolidated Financial
      Statements were prepared (1)”), pursuant to the provisions of Article 120,
      Paragraph 1 of the Company Accounting Regulation.
                     
                    We
      have no specific interest in the Company required to be stated by the
      provisions of the Certified Public Accountant Law.

                          We
      have audited the financial statements of Advantest Corporation (the
      “Company”) for its 67th fiscal year (April 1, 2008 through March 31,
      2009), which included the balance sheets, statements of income, statements
      of changes in stockholders’ equity, notes to non-consolidated financial
      statements, and its supporting schedules, for the purpose of reporting
      under the provisions of Article 436, Paragraph 2, Section 1 of the
      “Company Law.”  The management of the Company was responsible
      for the preparation of these financial statements and its supporting
      schedules, and our responsibility shall be limited to the expression of an
      independent opinion regarding the financial statements and its supporting
      schedules.
                           
                          We
      conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
      accepted in Japan.  The auditing standards require reasonable
      assurance that the financial statements and its supporting schedules do
      not contain any untrue statements of material fact.  The audit
      was conducted based on an audit by testing, and included a review of the
      financial statements and its supporting schedules as a whole and an
      evaluation of the accounting policies adopted by the management, the
      application thereof, and the estimates prepared by the
      management.  We believe that we have obtained a reasonable basis
      to form our opinion as a result of the audit.
                           
                          In
      our opinion, the above financial statements and its supporting schedules
      properly present the financial position and the results of operations of
      the Company during the fiscal year, in all material respects, in
      conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
      Japan.
                           
                          We
      have no specific interest in the Company required to be stated by the
      provisions of the Certified Public Accountant Law.

                Audit
      Report
                 
                This
      Audit Report was prepared by the Board of Corporate Auditors of Advantest
      Corporation (the “Company”) after deliberation, based on audit reports
      prepared by each Corporate Auditor with respect to the methods and results
      of audit concerning the performance of each Director of his/her respective
      duties during the 67th fiscal year (April 1, 2008 through March 31,
      2009).  We hereby report as follows.
                 
                1.    
      Methods of Audit by Corporate Auditors and the Board of Corporate
      Auditors, and its contents
                 
                In
      addition to establishing audit policies and audit plans for the fiscal
      year, and receiving reports from each Corporate Auditor on the
      implementation status and results of the audit, the Board of Corporate
      Auditors received reports from Directors and Independent Auditors on the
      performance of their duties and requested further explanations as deemed
      necessary.
                 
                In
      compliance with the rules of audit of Corporate Auditors established by
      the Board of Corporate Auditors, pursuant to the audit policies and audit
      plans, each Corporate Auditor communicated with Directors, Executive
      Officers as well as other employees such as members of the Audit Office in
      order to collect information, and improve the auditing system, attended
      meetings of the Board of Directors and other important meetings, received
      reports from Directors, Executive Officers and employees on the
      performance of their duties, requested further explanations as deemed
      necessary, reviewed important approval-granting documents, and inspected
      the state of business operations and assets at the head office and other
      important branch offices.
                 
                In
      addition, we monitored and reviewed the contents of resolutions of the
      meeting of the Board of Directors with respect to the development of a
      system as defined in Article 100, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Regulations
      for Enforcement of the Company Law, as well as the status of the system
      (Internal Control System) that has been developed based on such
      resolutions.
                 
                With
      respect to subsidiaries, we communicated with and exchanged information
      with Directors and Corporate Auditors of the subsidiaries and received
      business reports from subsidiaries as deemed necessary.
                 
                Based
      on the above methods, we reviewed the business report for the fiscal year
      and its supporting schedules.
                 
                In
      addition, we monitored and reviewed whether the Independent Auditors
      maintained their independent positions and conducted the audit properly,
      received reports from the Independent Auditors on the performance of their
      duties, and requested further explanations as deemed
      necessary.  Furthermore, we were informed by the Independent
      Auditor that they are establishing a “System to ensure the appropriate
      performance of duties” (Syokumu no Suikou ga Tekisetsu
      ni Okonawareru Koto o Kakuho Suru Tameno Taisei) (Matters as
      defined in each Section of Article 131 of the Company Accounting
      Regulations) pursuant to “Quality control standards of audit” (Kansa ni Kansuru Hinshitsu
      Kanri Kijyun)  (the Business Accounting Counsel, October
      28, 2005), and requested their explanations as deemed
      necessary.
                 
                Based
      on the above methods, we reviewed the financial statements (the balance
      sheets, statements of income, statements of changes in stockholders’
      equity, notes to non-consolidated financial statements) as well as its
      supporting schedules and the consolidated financial statements for the
      67th fiscal year (the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements
      of income, consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, and notes to
      consolidated financial statements).
