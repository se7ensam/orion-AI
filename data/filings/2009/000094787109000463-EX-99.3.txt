    Tokyo
–June 25, 2009 – Advantest Corporation (the “Company”) resolved at a meeting of
its Board of Directors today to issue stock options in the form of stock
acquisition rights pursuant to Articles 236, 238 and 240 of the Company Law
under the terms set forth below.
     
    
       
      
        
          
            
              
                
                    
                      
                        1.  Reason for
      issuance of the stock acquisition rights as stock options
                      
                      The Company issues
      stock acquisition rights to improve performance and morale of directors
      and executive officers of the Company, and corporate auditors’ awareness
      of proper auditing at the Company.  In this manner, the Company
      aims to promote a management style conscious of increasing shareholder
      value and to attract and retain outstanding personnel.
                    
                    
                      2.  Details of
      the stock acquisition rights
                       
                    
                    
                      
                        (1)  The
      number of directors, corporate auditors and executive officers receiving
      stock acquisition rights
                      
                      Directors, corporate
      auditors and executive officers of the Company, totaling 25

                        338,000 shares of
      common stock of the Company.

                          The number of shares
      to be issued or delivered upon exercise of each stock acquisition right
      shall be 100 shares, provided, that if the subscription price per share
      has been adjusted in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) below, the number
      of such shares shall be adjusted according to the following
      formula.  This adjustment shall be made only with respect to
      stock acquisition rights that have not yet been exercised as of the time
      of adjustment.  Any fractional share that arises as a result of
      an adjustment will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of
      shares.

      paid by the Company to directors, corporate auditors and executive
      officers pursuant to Article 246, Paragraph 2 of the Company
  Law.

                              The subscription
      price to be paid upon exercise of each stock acquisition right (the
      “Subscription Price”) shall be determined by multiplying (i) the
      Subscription Price per share as determined in the following paragraph, by
      (ii) the number of shares to be issued or delivered upon exercise of each
      stock acquisition right as specified in sub-paragraph (2) above
      (initially, 100 shares).
                            
                          
                          
                            
                              The Subscription
      Price per share shall be 1.05 times the average closing price, rounded up
      to the nearest yen, of the common stock of the Company in regular trading
      on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on each day of the month preceding the month
      in which any stock acquisition rights are allocated (excluding any such
      day on which there was no trade); provided, however, that if such amount
      is less than the closing price of the common stock of the Company on such
      day of allocation (or, if there was no trade on such day of allocation,
      the closing price on the immediately preceding day on which there was
      trade), the Subscription Price per share shall be equal to the closing
      price on such day of allocation.
                            
                          
                          
                            
                              If, subsequent to
      the day of allocation of the stock acquisition rights, the Company splits
      or consolidates its common stock, or issues new shares or disposes of its
      treasury shares below market price (excluding the issuance or transfer of
      the Company’s shares by exercise of the stock acquisition rights or
      conversion of securities which are convertible to the common stock of the
      Company), the Subscription Price per share shall be adjusted according to
      the formula set forth below, rounded up to the nearest
      yen.  Furthermore, the Subscription Price per share may, to the
      extent necessary and reasonable, be adjusted in a way deemed appropriate
      by the Company, (i) when the Company issues securities which are
      convertible to the common stock of the Company at a price lower than the
      fair value (including shares with acquisition claim rights and shares with
      acquisition clause, setting the Company’s common stock as consideration),
      (ii) when the Company issues the stock acquisition rights or securities
      with the stock acquisition rights that effect the issuance or transfer of
      the Company’s common stock at a price lower than the fair value, (iii)
      when the adjustment of the Subscription Price per share is necessary for
      merger, corporate split or stock-for-stock exchange, or (iv) other than
      above, when the adjustment of the Subscription Price per share is
      necessary due to the occurrence of matters that cause or may cause the
      number of outstanding shares of the Company to
  change.

                              (b)

      may not be exercised in
part.

                            When
      the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of the stock options

      defined below) shall be deemed to have requested the Company to purchase
      such shares pursuant to Article 192, Paragraph 1 of the Company
      Law.  The determination of whether the number of shares
      deliverable upon exercise includes less than one unit shall be made by
      taking into account the aggregate number of shares deliverable upon each
      exercise of one or more stock
options.

                          The Company shall
      automatically acquire the stock acquisition rights, for no consideration,
      if:

                    the
      general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve (if approval by the
      shareholders’ meeting is not legally required, then the Board of Directors
      may approve) (i) any merger agreement pursuant to which the Company shall
      dissolve, (ii) any agreement or a plan pursuant to which the Company shall
      split all or part of its business or (iii) any stock-for-stock exchange
      agreement or stock-transfer plan pursuant to which the Company shall

      longer holds the position of a director, corporate auditor, executive
      officer, employee, advisor, part-time worker or any other similar position
      of the Company or its subsidiaries, except when the Company acknowledges
      that the exercise of the stock option by a Stock Option Holder is
      reasonable and notifies the Stock Option
Holder;
