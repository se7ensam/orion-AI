</DIV>


<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Company penetrates into traditional media<BR>
and strengthens leadership in digital media advertising</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Beijing, China &#151; March&nbsp;13, 2009 &#151; AirMedia Group Inc. (Nasdaq: AMCN), operator of the largest
digital media network in China dedicated to air travel advertising, today announced that it
recently obtained the contractual concession rights to operate various traditional advertising
media in Beijing Capital International Airport and Shenzhen International Airport and digital
frames in the baggage claim areas in Beijing Capital International Airport. In addition, AirMedia
also renewed its concession rights contract for digital TV screens in Shenzhen International
Airport.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">AirMedia entered into a concession rights contract with Beijing Capital International Airport to
operate traditional advertising formats including billboards, light boxes and other formats in 376
locations at Terminals 1, 2, and 3 of Beijing Capital International Airport from April&nbsp;1, 2009 to
March&nbsp;31, 2012. AirMedia will start operating most of these 376 locations on April&nbsp;1, 2009. In the
same contract, AirMedia also obtains concession rights to operate digital frames in the baggage
claim areas in all of the three Terminals from April&nbsp;1, 2009 to March&nbsp;31, 2012. Previously,
AirMedia only operated digital frames in the departure areas of Terminals 2 and 3. The newly
obtained concession rights will significantly enhance AirMedia&#146;s digital frame presence in the
arrival areas to meet advertisers&#146; strong demands for advertisements in Beijing Capital
International Airport.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">AirMedia also entered into a concession rights contract with Shenzhen International Airport to
operate 90 light boxes in the arrival walkways of Terminals A and B of Shenzhen International
Airport from April&nbsp;1, 2009 to December&nbsp;31, 2011. AirMedia will start operating the light boxes in
most of these 90 locations on April&nbsp;1, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">&#147;We are excited about the signing of these contracts as we expected in our fourth quarter 2008
earnings release. These contracts also opened a new era for AirMedia to become a one-stop operator
of both digital and traditional media in the air travel advertising sector with a leading market
share. We believe we are now better positioned to broaden and integrate our customer base,
strengthen our pricing power and further enhance our relationships with airports and airlines,&#148;
commented Herman Guo, chairman and chief executive officer of AirMedia.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In a separate concession rights contract with Shenzhen International Airport, AirMedia also renewed
its concession rights contract to continue operating digital TV screens in Shenzhen International
Airport from January&nbsp;1, 2009 to December&nbsp;31, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Taking into account the above new concession rights contracts and some other concession rights
contracts expected to be entered into, AirMedia currently expects that total concession fees for
all the product lines in the second quarter of 2009 will be at least US$30.3&nbsp;million.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This announcement contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the &#147;safe
harbor&#148; provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as &#147;will,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148;
&#147;future,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;confident&#148; and similar statements. Among other
things, the quotations from management in this announcement, as well as AirMedia Group Inc.&#146;s
strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. AirMedia may also make written
or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on Forms 20-F and 6-K, etc., in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and
other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to
third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about AirMedia&#146;s
beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve
inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, if advertisers or the viewing public do not accept,
or lose interest in, our air travel digital media network, we may be unable to generate sufficient
cash flow from our operating activities and our prospects and results of operations could be
negatively affected; we derive substantially all of our revenues from the provision of air travel
advertising services, and if there is a downturn in the air travel advertising industry, we may not
be able to diversify our revenue sources; if our customers reduce their advertising spending due to
an economic downturn in China and/or elsewhere or for any other reason, our revenues and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected; if we are unable to retain existing concession
rights contracts or obtain new concession rights contracts on commercially advantageous terms that
allow us to place or operate the digital TV screens in airports or on airplanes, we may be unable
to maintain or expand our network coverage and our business and prospects may be harmed; a
substantial majority of our revenues are currently concentrated in the five largest airports and
three largest airlines in China, and if any of these airports or airlines experiences a material
business disruption, our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected; AirMedia&#146;s limited operating history makes it difficult to
evaluate our future prospects and results of operations; and other risks outlined in AirMedia&#146;s
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. AirMedia does not undertake any
obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.
