Ballard Reports 2008 Operating Achievements and Provides 2009 Outlook


For Immediate Release – January 26, 2009


VANCOUVER, CANADA – Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDPD) announced its operating
achievements for the year ended December 31, 2008 and provided an outlook for 2009 today. All
amounts are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.


“2008 was a successful year for Ballard, both in terms of solid operating results and
transformational progress,” said John Sheridan, President and CEO. “Given this progress, our
outlook for 2009 is for strong commercial growth, despite the challenging macro-economic
conditions. We expect this to be driven primarily by sales of our FCgenTM products for
backup power in India and the EU, and FCvelocityTM products for material handling in the
USA”.


2008 Achievements






     
     
    Transformational Progress









     
    •
     
    Completed strategic re-positioning with the closing of the automotive transaction on
January 31, recording a $97 million gain.









     
    •
     
    Strengthened financial position by further reducing operating cash
consumption1, and by augmenting cash reserves with the closing of the
non-dilutive financing transaction with Superior Plus on December 31, with net cash
proceeds of approximately $34 million.









     
    •
     
    Accelerated fuel cell product adoption as evidenced by the high volume supply agreement
with ACME Tele Power announced on October 9, and the extended supply agreement with Plug
Power in tandem with the Central Grocers full fleet order for 220 GenDriveTM
units announced by Plug on December 11.









     
     
    Solid Operating Results









    •
     
    Product shipments exceeded Ballard’s 2008 target of 1,700 units, with a total of 1,855
units shipped.









    •
     
    Revenue met revised guidance, ending the year at approximately $59 million (unaudited),
achieving approximately 15% growth over prior year’s revenue on a pro-forma basis, adjusting
for automotive engineering development.









     
    •
     
    Operating cash consumption1 met full year guidance at approximately $29
million (unaudited), down 24% from 2007, despite a $3 million negative impact in 2008 from
FX losses resulting from mark to market adjustments on Canadian monetary assets.









     
    •
     
    Cash reserves of approximately $85 million.





Please note that the 2008 financial results are unaudited and Ballard expects to release its
audited 2008 year-end financial results on March 4, 2009.


2009 Outlook






    •
     
    Growth in total product shipments to 4,000 units, more than double the 2008 level









     
    •
     
    Material Handling — 1,000 FCvelocityTM-9SSL units;









     
    •
     
    Backup Power — 2,500 FCgenTM-1020 and FCgenTM-1300 units; and









     
    •
     
    Residential Cogeneration – 500 FCgenTM-1030 units.









    •
     
    Revenue growth of 15% to 30% ($68 million to $78 million).









    •
     
    Operating cash consumption1 reduction of 7% to 40% ($17 million to $27 million).





The operating cash consumption1 outlook reflects a year over year improvement in product
and service margins and significant reductions in operating expenses and working capital
requirements, partially offset by increased expenditures of approximately $3 million for
FCgenTM-1300 product development and approximately $5 million for increased production
capacity for projected 2010 volume growth.

    Operating cash consumption is a non-GAAP measure used to assist in assessing Ballard’s
financial performance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP
and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
Operating cash consumption measures the amount of cash required to fund the operating activities of
Ballard’s business and excludes financing and investing activities except for additions to
property, plant and equipment.
