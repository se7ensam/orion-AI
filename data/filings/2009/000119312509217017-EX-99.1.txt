   AEGON to repay EUR 1 billion to Dutch State  THE HAGUE – AEGON has notified the Dutch State and Vereniging AEGON that it
will exercise its option to repay one third of the EUR 3 billion in core capital the company secured last year through its largest shareholder, Vereniging AEGON and funded by the Dutch State. AEGON first announced its intention to repay the Dutch
State in August when it raised EUR 1 billion in a successful equity issue.  The amount will be repaid on November 30, 2009 including
accrued interest from May 22, 2009 in accordance with the terms of AEGON’s agreement with the Dutch State. The Dutch Central Bank has given its consent for the repayment.  “It continues to be our intention to fully repay the Dutch State at the earliest opportunity – and this is a first step toward doing so,” said Alex Wynaendts, AEGON’s CEO.
“AEGON’s strong excess capital position and the improved economic outlook support our decision to fully exercise the option of early repayment”.  Under the terms of AEGON’s agreement with the Dutch State, the premium for repayment amounts to a maximum of 13% depending on the volume weighted average share price of AEGON shares on the five
trading days from November 23 until November 27.
