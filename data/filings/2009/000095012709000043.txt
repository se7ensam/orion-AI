2009.

Copies of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 are available on the
Company's website http://www.acergy-group.com/public/FinancialReports.

The Annual General Meeting of shareholders will be held on Friday May 22, 2009

412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg. All shareholders of record as of Tuesday
March 31, 2009 will be entitled to vote at the meeting.

If the Annual General Meeting of shareholders approve the proposed payment of
dividend of USD $0.22 per Common Share, the shareholders who will be entitled to
such dividend will be those who are shareholders of record as of Thursday May
28, 2009. In such case the first trading date ex-dividend will be Tuesday May
26, 2009 and the date of payment of dividend will be Friday June 12, 2009 and
Wednesday June 17, 2009 for holders of our ADRs.

The information set forth above and referred to and presented in the attached
press releases shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that
section, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under
the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific
reference in such filing.

Certain statements set forth above and referred to and presented in the press
release furnished pursuant to this Form 6-K may include "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and

identified by the use of words like "anticipate," "believe," "estimate,"
"expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "project," "will," "should," "seek," and
similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to,
statements as to the expected timing of and record date for the Annual General

views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following
factors, and others which are discussed in the Company's public filings and
submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those
that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially from
the Company's forward-looking statements: the Company's ability to recover costs
on significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the
markets and businesses in which the Company operates; the Company's relationship
with significant clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or
governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the
timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion
programmes; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including
spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's
ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue
reliance on the forward-looking statements.
