financial markets significantly impacted AEGON’s earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008. This challenging environment which has persisted in the early part of 2009 confirms that our strategic priorities of releasing capital and reducing
costs, as well as putting in place contingencies to withstand further market deterioration are the right ones. In the fourth quarter, we released EUR 1 billion of capital and expect to release a further EUR 1.5 billion in 2009. Our businesses in the
United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are also on track to deliver on our target of EUR 150 million in cost reductions in 2009. We are pleased by the continued confidence of our customers as evidenced by resilient sales and a
strong increase in deposits. We believe that the solid fundamentals of our business, combined with AEGON’s financial position and the actions we are taking justify their continued confidence.”

 The calculation of the
IGD (Insurance Group Directive) capital surplus and ratio have been changed from the disclosure in the previous quarter to better reflect regulatory solvency requirements of local regulators and are based on Solvency I capital requirements on IFRS
for entities within the EU, and local regulatory solvency measurements for non-EU entities. Specifically, required capital for the life insurance companies in the US is calculated as two times the upper end of the Company Action Level range

Strategic highlights and short-term priorities        In June 2008, AEGON set out three strategic
priorities:   


1.
To reallocate capital toward businesses with higher growth and return prospects;   


2.
To improve growth and returns from existing businesses;   


3.
Manage AEGON as an international company.  Subsequently, at the
Analyst & Investor Day on November 24, AEGON identified and announced three priorities to counter the challenges of the current global financial crisis and position the company for growth:   


•
 
 Focus on capital preservation and accelerate the capital release program, with a EUR 600-800 million target for Q4 2008;   


•
 
 EUR 150 million cost reduction program for 2009;   


•
 
 Develop contingency plans for continued deterioration in financial markets.  As announced last June, AEGON is conducting an ongoing review of its portfolio of businesses to ensure that they meet the criteria outlined in the strategy. On February 17, 2009, AEGON announced that due to the
market dislocation it will downsize its institutional business (AEGON Institutional Market Division, IMD) in the Americas, which will result in lower credit risk in the long run and a release of capital in the near term.  AEGON and the global financial crisis  In the fourth quarter of 2008,
the financial crisis accelerated and a severe global economic downturn began to unfold. Liquidity in financial markets was severely affected. Equity markets were down by more than 20%, while equity market volatility rose to a historical high.
Meanwhile, as government bond yields reached historic lows, credit spreads more than doubled across many market segments in Q4.  The downturn in financial
markets has significantly impacted AEGON’s results. Moreover, the continued deterioration in the US housing market increased risks in mortgage backed securities, leading to impairments. Also, corporate bonds, in particular high yield,
experienced higher defaults.  In order to provide a fuller view of the possible impacts of the financial crisis on AEGON, management disclosed updated
earnings and capital  
sensitivities to a possible further downturn of financial markets. In particular, this additional information pertained to equity market exposure,
impairments and interest rate movements. Given market developments and the ongoing uncertainty regarding the financial and economic environment, AEGON felt
it was prudent to reinforce its capital buffer to a level substantially in excess of its AA capital adequacy requirements. On October 28, AEGON announced that it had secured EUR 3 billion of additional core capital from Vereniging AEGON funded
by the Dutch State.  Capital preservation  As the
financial crisis unfolded, acceleration of capital preservation actions has been a priority. The actions taken and plans to be executed are evidence of the financial flexibility within AEGON to manage through these extraordinary times. They include:
  


•
 
 Releasing EUR 1.7 billion of capital in the second half year of 2008, including EUR 1 billion in the fourth quarter, by actively reducing risks - including
investment risks, optimizing asset and liability management, reinsurance transactions and securitization;   


•
 
 Releasing an additional EUR 1.5 billion of capital in 2009 by lowering investment risk, and transferring risk through reinsurance.   


•
 
 Reducing spread-based balances within AEGON’s institutional business in the United States by EUR 14 billion, freeing up EUR 0.6 billion of capital in the next
two years (EUR 0.3 billion in 2009, which is included in total expected capital releases for 2009 of EUR 1.5 billion).  The capital
preservation actions in Q4 2008 of EUR 1 billion are expected to have a negative effect on earnings of EUR 60 million on an annual basis. As these actions are largely derisking measures, they can be reversed at any time.  As a result of actions taken, the capital position of the company remains strong with excess capital of EUR 2.9 billion over AA capital adequacy requirements at
year-end, a significant buffer against further market deterioration.

 Cost measures  AEGON announced cost reduction measures totaling EUR 150 million in 2009. Actions to achieve this include: 
 


•
 
 Americas: no wage increases in 2009, staff reductions, deferred hiring, reorganization of the agency distribution, downsizing IMD;   


•
 
 The Netherlands: reduction of contract services, process reengineering, general cost savings;   


•
 
 United Kingdom: restructuring of IT and marketing and customer services, cost containment, savings in distribution.  Capital management and capital position  AEGON capitalizes its
businesses at the higher of:   


•
 
 Regulatory requirements;   


•
 
 AA capital adequacy requirements;   


•
 
 Any self-imposed additional economic requirements under AEGON’s economic framework.  AEGON has EUR 2.9 billion excess capital over AA capital adequacy requirements and has an IGD capital surplus of EUR 5.6 billion, equivalent to an IGD solvency ratio of
183% (2007: 190%). Regulatory requirements are set by local regulators, while the IGD ratio is a European regulatory solvency calculation. The methodology to calculate the IGD ratio has changed from the disclosure over the third quarter results to
better reflect regulatory solvency requirements of the respective local regulators. The previously disclosed IGD ratio included the calculation of the ratio for the businesses outside of the EU based on EU Solvency I capital requirements. The IGD
ratio now takes into account Solvency I capital requirements on IFRS for entities within the EU, and local regulatory solvency measurements for non-EU entities. Specifically, required capital for the life insurance companies in the United States is
calculated as two times the upper end of the Company Action Level range (200%) as applied by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the United States. AEGON does not manage its capital base to the IGD ratio. AEGON USA had a NAIC
RBC ratio of 350%, compared with 336% at the end of 2007.    Core capital at year-end came in at EUR 9.1 billion, consisting
of EUR 6.1 billion of shareholders’ equity and EUR 3 billion of convertible core capital securities provided by Vereniging AEGON, funded by the Dutch State. Core capital includes a negative revaluation account on available-for-sale assets of
EUR 7.2 billion. Excluding the revaluation account, core capital amounted to EUR 16.2 billion, 78% of the total capital base, above the minimum target of 70%.  AEGON’s negative revaluation account increased during the fourth quarter by EUR 1.7 billion, the result of unprecedented credit spread widening, more than offsetting the effect of declines in government bond yields.  AEGON has not reclassified assets held as available-for-sale (AFS) to loans or held-to-maturity assets. Also, AEGON transferred a very limited amount of assets valued
based on market prices to mark-to-model valuations, driven by current market developments. The mark-to-model is now 1.1% (EUR 1.1 billion) of the total valuation of debt instruments held at fair value (2007: 0.4%). For more details we refer to the
explanatory notes on page 36.  The lower valuation of the AFS bond portfolio will only affect earnings before tax if AEGON:   


•
 
 Is forced to sell those investments at a loss; or   


•
 
 Impairs certain investments because the company does not expect to receive (part of) interest and/or principal.  AEGON’s long-term business model, and its liquidity and asset and liability management, ensure that it is unlikely that AEGON will be forced to sell assets at
distressed prices, as reflected in the revaluation account, to generate cash. Therefore, AEGON’s negative revaluation reserve is not a good indication of future losses. AEGON expects impairments will be at elevated levels in 2009, due to the
economic situation.

   Operational
highlights      Overview  AEGON reported a net loss for Q4 of EUR 1.2 billion. Results are in line with preliminary results announced on February 17, 2009 and were significantly impacted by
financial markets.  Underlying earnings were down mainly due to declining financial markets, resulting in reserve strengthening and accelerated
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) in the variable annuities line of business in the Americas and reduced fees on asset balances in general.  Net income was also down due to increased impairment charges and the impact of financial markets on so-called fair value items, which include certain investment classes in the Netherlands and the Americas, as well as a number of products
containing financial guarantees. Lower equity and credit markets, as well as increased implied volatilities and lower interest rates severely impacted the fair value of guarantees in these products. In addition, alternative investment classes, like
hedge funds and private equity, significantly underperformed long-term expected returns.  Impairments came primarily from housing related structured
assets, corporate high-yield bonds and equity investments. The impairments on corporate credit were driven by a number of small impairments.  Net income
also includes an extraordinary tax charge of EUR 300 million, related to intercompany reinsurance treaties between Ireland and the United States, offsetting the tax benefit from the reported operational losses. These reinsurance treaties are
accounted for at fair value in both tax jurisdictions, while gains in the United States are taxed at 35% and losses in Ireland are tax deductible at 12.5%.  Underlying earnings before tax  In Q4 the underlying loss for the company amounted to EUR 181 million.  Underlying earnings in the Americas came in at a negative USD 412 million. The impact on earnings from lower equity markets of USD 839 million mainly affected:
  


a)
The variable annuity business (USD 587 million) due to minimum guarantee reserves strengthening and accelerated amortization of DPAC and lower fees;   


b)
The life reinsurance business as result of reserve strengthening of variable annuity blocks of business (USD 150 million); and   


c)
The life business (USD 65 million).  Underlying earnings in the Americas
in Q4 also included USD 230 million of one-off charges, the most significant being an increase in the long-term assumption for equity market volatility (USD 145 million). Earnings also include a charge of USD 40 million related to
intangible assets from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch’s life insurance businesses, and a USD 45 million asset write-off in life reinsurance. In Q4 2007, underlying earnings in the Americas included a positive USD 52 million from
updated mortality assumptions in the life business.  In the Netherlands, underlying earnings were down 31% to EUR 75 million. The positive impact of an
exceptional dividend received and better technical results in the pension business in the Netherlands was more than offset by decreases in investment income as well as charges in other lines of business. These charges include adverse technical
results in the non-life business, system and project related one-off expenses and restructuring charges.  Underlying earnings in the United Kingdom,
meanwhile, were GBP 13 million, a decline of GBP 34 million due primarily to the impact of lower equity and credit markets on fee charges in the pension business. Other lines of business in the United Kingdom performed well.  The decline in underlying earnings from Other countries to a loss of EUR 17 million was the result mainly of accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs
in Taiwan (EUR 43 million), as underlying earnings in Central & Eastern Europe increased 87% to EUR 28 million and in Spain 11% to EUR 10 million.

 Net income  Net income includes results on so-called fair value items, which include certain investment classes in the Netherlands and the
Americas, as well as a number of products containing financial guarantees. The total underperformance of these fair value items amounted to EUR 770 million. The valuation of the fair value of liability guarantees reflects decreased interest rates,
declining equity markets and sharply increased equity volatilities, as well as discount rates including a credit spread, a reflection of extremely dislocated and very illiquid markets.  Underperformance of fair value items  In Q4 2008, underperformance of alternative investment classes, such as hedge
funds, private equity and credit derivatives, in the Americas and the Netherlands amounted to EUR 500 million.  Fair value items include the
under/overperformance on assets held at fair value through profit and loss and backing liabilities of a specific portfolio of group pension contracts in the Netherlands. In Q4 these assets underperformed long term expected returns by EUR 149
million.  In order to maintain consistency in definitions, starting in Q4 2008, the net impact of the fair value movements of guarantees and the related
hedges in the Netherlands has been included in fair value items. Previously, differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness, were reported in gains/losses on investments. Results for prior years
have been adjusted (see Financial supplement Q4 2008).  Lower bond and equity markets, as well as higher volatilities and lower interest rates negatively
impacted the performance of certain products with guarantees reported at fair value. Those negative impacts were partly offset by a credit spread in the discount rates, a reflection of extremely dislocated and very illiquid markets. Products with
guarantees at fair value contributed a total negative EUR 139 million to earnings. This includes mainly:   


•
 
 Net fair value losses on GMWB guarantees and related hedges in the Americas and the United Kingdom (EUR 280 million), segregated funds in Canada (EUR 201 million)
and total return annuities (EUR 82 million);   


•
 
 Partially offset by EUR 425 million positive impact from hedge ineffectiveness in the Netherlands,.  Effectiveness of hedging was affected by extreme volatility in Q4, while higher implied volatilities impacted the valuation of guarantees.  Gains on investments  Gains on investments of EUR 136 million
include primarily gains on derivatives considered as economic hedges at holding level and the Netherlands as well as realized gains on the sale of bonds, offset by lower real estate values in the Netherlands.  Impairment charges  Impairments of EUR 501 million included EUR
360 million on bonds/mortgages, primarily structured assets (subprime bonds EUR 100 million) and a number of corporate bonds in the Americas (EUR 158 million), as well as equity impairments (EUR 141 million). The impairments in corporate credit
were driven by a number of small impairments. Equity investments are impaired when market values are 20% below cost price or when they are in an unrealized loss position for more than six months.  Tax  The tax benefit from the underlying loss, impairments and
mark-to-market losses on the fair value items is more than offset by significant additional taxes related to cross border intercompany reinsurance transactions (EUR 300 million). These reinsurance treaties are accounted for at fair value in both tax
jurisdictions, while gains in the United States are taxed at 35% and losses in Ireland are tax deductible at 12.5%. The driver of the tax losses in Ireland is credit spread widening. These tax losses are largely expected to reverse as the book
matures and when credit spreads narrow.  Commissions and expenses  Commissions and expenses increased by 30% to EUR 1,863 million, primarily due to acceleration of DPAC amortization. Operating expenses increased by 7% to EUR 928 million, including several one-off items such
as restructuring charges, redundancy charges and provisions.

 Sales  Total new life sales for the company were in line with Q3 2008, and decreased by 19% (at constant currency) to EUR 598 million
compared to Q4 2007. With the exception of the UK and Spain, all countries recorded lower sales in Q4 compared to Q4 2007. New life sales in the Americas were down 43% in local currency, particularly due to lower bank-owned and corporate owned life
insurance (BOLI/COLI) sales (down 83%). Economic conditions also affected the high net worth market as well as variable universal life sales in the middle market.  In Q4 2008 new life sales in the Netherlands decreased by 44% in local currency, primarily due to a 57% decline in pension sales, as Q4 2007 included several large contracts, while retail life sales held up reasonably well. New life sales
in the United Kingdom increased by 5%, mainly driven by growth in the corporate pension market and individual annuities, offset by lower individual pension sales.    New life sales in Q4
declined 34% to EUR 58 million in Other countries. In Central & Eastern Europe, sales of recurring premium life insurance rose 13%. Single premium sales in Poland were sharply lower because of a decline in equity markets, driving down
total new life sales in Central & Eastern Europe by 27%.  In Spain, sales of life insurance rose to EUR 23 million, due primarily to
extraordinary activity, following changes in pension legislation. Sales through CAM, AEGON’s largest bank partner in Spain, tripled to EUR 77 million (on a 100% basis), as a result of a successful strategy to increase the insurance
penetration ratio among their existing client base. In Asia, new life sales decreased to EUR 13 million as increased sales in China were more than offset by a decline in Taiwan.

 Deposits  Total gross on and off balance deposits for the company increased by 24% to EUR 11.9 billion in Q4. The increase is mainly a
result of the continued growth in fixed annuity deposits and strong demand for synthetic guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) in the Americas during Q4 2008. In the pension business in the Americas, sales of retirement plans held up well. Variable
annuity sales as well as asset management and mutual fund sales declined due to the volatility in the equity markets in Q4 2008. Sales of on balance guaranteed investment contracts in Q4 2008 increased by 46% in local currency. AEGON sees limited
opportunities to grow spread-based business profitably in the foreseeable future and announced on February 17, 2009, its decision to downsize the portfolio of institutional spread-based products.    Gross deposits in Central & Eastern Europe increased 18%. Higher pension deposits in all country units, reflecting growth of the business as well as the incorporation of new acquisitions, were partly offset
by lower production of mutual funds and third party asset management products in Hungary due to the decline of equity markets.  Deposits in Asia increased
by EUR 148 million due to the newly acquired asset management business in China.  Net deposits for the company amounted to EUR 1.7 billion as a result
of strong fixed annuity and synthetic guaranteed investment contracts deposits, partly offset by net outflows of savings deposits in the Netherlands. In Central & Eastern Europe, the pension business continued to report strong net inflows.

   Americas
      


•
 
 Underlying loss of USD 412 million, including USD 839 million impact from steep decline in equity markets and USD 145 million impact from higher
volatility assumptions   


•
 
 Continued momentum in fixed annuity deposits, driving 11% increase in total value of new business; strong retirement plan sales; total net deposits USD 3.0
billion   


•
 
 Impact of USD 1.3 billion on earnings from fair value items, due to lower interest rates, lower equity markets, increased equity market volatility and
underperformance of alternative assets   


•
 
 Impairments of USD 499 million; USD 184 million on structured assets; USD 232 million on corporate credit    Overview  Financial markets accelerated their negative trend in the fourth quarter and the economy showed signs of
considerable contraction. Equity markets showed a steep decline, volatilities spiked, credit risk increased and credit spreads widened to an extent not seen before, while at the same time, government bond yields came down to historic lows.
 Results in Q4 2008 in the Americas were significantly impacted by the financial markets turmoil. Underlying earnings were down primarily due to the impact
of a more than 20% decline in equity markets on reserve strengthening, accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and lower fees. Also, long-term assumptions for equity market volatility were increased, resulting in a negative impact of
USD 145 million primarily in the variable annuity line of business. In Q4 2007, underlying results in the life business included a favorable USD 52 million contribution to earnings from the update of mortality assumptions.  Fair value items showed a considerable underperformance of USD 1.3 billion, driven by alternative investment returns, the impact from an increase in implied volatility
and lower interest rates on fair valuation of guarantees, hedge ineffectiveness and wider credit spreads.  Results in the Americas also included USD
499 million of impairments, including USD 184 million of structured asset impairments, primarily securities backed by subprime mortgages. Impairments of corporate bonds were concentrated in the high yield portfolio and were driven by a
number of small impairments.    Sales of individual savings and retirement products rose sharply, driven by continued demand for fixed annuities. New life sales were down in all lines of business,
however, particularly in BOLI/COLI (bank-owned/corporate-owned life insurance). Value of new business was up 11%, primarily due to higher fixed annuity sales.  Underlying earnings before tax  AEGON reported an underlying loss before tax in the Americas for Q4 2008 of USD 412 million:   


•
 
 Earnings from Life & Protection declined 39% compared to Q4 2007 to USD 227 million. The decline in equity markets led to a charge of USD 65 million. In Q4
2007 underlying earnings included a favorable USD 52 million from updated mortality assumptions;   


•
 
 Individual Savings & Retirement earnings were a loss of USD 623 million, due to the equity markets impact on minimum guarantee reserve strengthening
and accelerated DPAC amortization (in total USD 587 million). Long-term assumptions for equity market volatility were increased, a one-off negative impact of USD 135 million. Earnings also include a charge of USD 40 million related to
intangible assets from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch’s life insurance businesses;   


•
 
 Pensions & Asset Management earnings decreased to USD 23 million, a result of lower fees from declined asset balances; 
 


•
 
 Earnings from the Institutional business were down 4% to USD 131 million on lower BOLI/COLI earnings. A decrease in short-term rates continued to produce
strong positive spreads on institutional guaranteed products;   


•
 
 In the Life Reinsurance business the underlying loss amounted to USD 170 million, including a USD 150 million due to the equity markets impact on minimum
guarantee reserve strengthening, and an USD 45 million asset write-off.

 Net income  AEGON reported a net loss for Q4 of USD 1,859 million in the Americas, including three significant items: underperformance
of fair value items (USD 1.3 billion), impairment charges (USD 499 million) and a tax charge (USD 429 million).  The underperformance of fair value items
comprised a number of different elements:   


•
 
 Total fair value investments underperformed by USD 531 million as a result of alternative assets underperforming expected long-term returns and
underperformance of credit derivatives and adjustments on other credit-related instruments;   


•
 
 Lower interest rates, declining equity markets, increased equity market volatility and widening credit spreads contributed to a USD 798 million lower
mark-to-market valuation for GMWB guarantees, total return annuities and Canadian segregated funds. The valuation of the fair value of liability guarantees includes sharply increased equity volatilities, as well as discount rates including a credit
spread, a reflection of extremely dislocated and very illiquid markets.  Total impairment charges in the Americas during Q4 totaled USD
499 million. These impairments include USD 184 million of impairments on mortgage backed securities, of which the majority is backed by subprime hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. Net impairments on corporate bonds were USD 232 million. Other
impairments include equity and commercial mortgage loan impairments.  The tax benefit from the underlying loss, impairments and mark-to-market losses on
the fair value items was more than offset by significant additional taxes related to cross border intercompany reinsurance transactions (USD 429 million). These reinsurance treaties are accounted for at fair value in both tax jurisdictions, while
gains in the United States are taxed at 35% and losses in Ireland are tax deductible at 12.5%. The driver of the tax losses in Ireland is credit spread widening. These tax losses are largely expected to reverse as the book matures and when credit
spreads narrow.    Commissions and expenses  Total commissions and expenses increased 46%
in Q4, primarily due to accelerated DPAC amortization following lower equity markets. Q4 operating expenses were level with operating expenses last year.  Sales and deposits  Total new life sales in the Americas were down 43% in the quarter, driven primarily by a decline in the BOLI/COLI
business. Activity in the BOLI/COLI market has declined significantly as a result of the current financial crisis. Life reinsurance and life sales were down as well compared to last year, but were in line with Q3 2008 sales. However, the economic
downturn continues to impact sales of both high net worth and equity-indexed universal life products in the middle market.  Total gross deposits were up
21% compared to last year on continued growth in fixed annuity sales (USD 2.3 billion) and strong demand for synthetic guaranteed investment contracts. In the pension and asset management business, sales of retirement plans came in strong, while
total pension deposits were down in particular due to lack of terminal funding sales.  Managed assets clearly declined because of financial market turmoil,
which also affected mutual fund sales as well as variable annuity deposits. Compared with Q4 2007 variable annuity deposits were down 17%.  Sales of
accident and health products were in line with sales in Q3 2008.  Value of new business  The value of new business (VNB) in the Americas amounted to USD 167 million, and the internal rate of return (IRR) was 12.4%, both driven primarily by strong fixed
annuity production. The VNB and IRR were negatively affected by hedge costs in the variable annuity business. Please refer to page 28 for more detailed information on VNB.  Revenue generating investments  AEGON’s total revenue generating investments at the end of December 2008 totaled
USD 286 billion, down 6% from three months earlier, on lower financial markets.

   The
Netherlands       


•
 
 Underlying earnings declined 31% to EUR 75 million   


•
 
 Life sales down 44%, due to a standstill in group pension market; retail sales held up well    Overview  The Netherlands reported a net income in Q4 of EUR 124 million. Underlying earnings were down 31% to EUR
75 million compared to Q4 2007. The positive impact of an exceptional dividend received and better technical results in the pension business was more than offset by decreases in investment income as well as (one-off) charges in other lines of
business. These charges include system and project related expenses, restructuring charges and adverse technical results.  Fair value items overperformed
long-term expectations by EUR 152 million. Fair value items include:   


a)
Under/overperformance of assets held at fair value through profit and loss, backing liabilities of a specific portfolio of group pension contracts held in the general account;
  


b)
Differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness, previously reported in gains/losses on investments; 
 


c)
Private equity investments.  Impairments were EUR 68 million, while
investment gains amounted to EUR 84 million.  Underlying earnings before tax   


•
 
 Life reported a loss of EUR 34 million on lower investment income and higher costs, including EUR 27 million of system and project related expenses as
well as slightly lower technical results;   


•
 
 In Accident and Health the underlying loss came in at EUR 3 million, due to higher claims, lower investment income and higher expenses;
  


•
 
 Earnings in the Savings business came in at a loss of EUR 20 million. Competition in the savings market is fierce, putting pressure on margins and volumes. Q4 2007
earnings included EUR 15 million of non-recurring accelerated amortization of deferred costs;   


•
 
 Earnings from Pensions & Asset Management amounted to EUR 169 million, the result of an exceptional EUR 75 million dividend and better technical
results of EUR 37 million;   


•
 
 Earnings from Distribution include an exceptional restructuring charge of EUR 21 million. Also, the slowdown in the real estate market led to lower overall
revenues. Earnings in Q4 2007 included a one-off charge of EUR 12 million related to the harmonization of claw back provisions of the Unirobe Meeùs Groep;   


•
 
 General insurance earnings were down, mainly due to higher claims, lower investment income and expenses to improve and grow the business.
 Net income  Fair value items include
the under/overperformance on assets held at fair value through profit and loss, backing liabilities of a specific portfolio of group pension contracts held in the general account. In Q4 these assets underperformed long-term expected returns by EUR
149 million. Private equity investments, included in fair value items, significantly underperformed long term excepted return by EUR 124 million.  Also, in
order to maintain consistency in definitions, starting in Q4 2008, the net impact of the fair value movements of guarantees and the related hedges has been included in fair value items. Previously, differences in fair value between guarantees and
related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness, were reported in gains/losses on investments. Earnings include a EUR 425 million positive impact from hedge ineffectiveness.  The valuation of the fair value of liability guarantees includes sharply increased interest rate and equity volatilities, as well as discount rates including a credit spread, a reflection of extremely dislocated and
very illiquid markets.  Impairments of EUR 68 million were primarily related to equities and high yield bonds.  Investment gains amounted to EUR 84 million and include gains on derivatives considered as economic hedges and realized gains on the sale of bonds, offset by lower
real estate values.   
   Local knowledge. Global power. | Page 14 of 42 





 Commissions and expenses  Commissions and expenses increased by 5%, due primarily to higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased
as a result of a one-time restructuring charge of EUR 21 million as well as a one-off EUR 27 million of system and project related expenses, while Q4 2007 included a total EUR 27 million of one-time charges in the Savings and
Distribution businesses.  Sales and deposits  Group
pension sales declined significantly during the quarter – the result of market volatility and clients’ increased reluctance to take decisions. At the same time, the Dutch group pension market has become increasingly competitive. Renewal
rates did, however, continue to improve. Sales figures for Q4 2007 also included several large contracts.  Sales of both single and regular premium
individual life products held up reasonably well with a decline of 13%. Lower expiring deferred annuities resulted in lower sales of immediate annuities. Regular premium production declined as there is less appetite in the market for universal life
products. During the year, life production increased 3%, while the Dutch life market contracted by an estimated 1% in 2008.    Sales in accident & health were stable, mainly due to a
saturated market. Alternative disability products have been successfully introduced, and partly offset the decline in WIA (the disability product introduced in 2006) sales during the quarter. Sales of general insurance products were in line with Q3
2008.  Gross deposits were down by 10% compared with Q4 2007, due to fierce competition. Net deposits showed a decline as well, as clients withdrew
balances in excess of the State guaranteed level of EUR 100,000 per account as concerns about the stability of banks, in general, increased.  Value
of new business  The value of new business (VNB) increased to EUR 13 million and the internal rate of return improved to 10.8%, primarily as a
result of a change in business mix.  Please refer to page 28 for more detailed information on VNB.  Revenue generating investments  At the end of December 2008, revenue
generating investments totaled EUR 63 billion; flat compared to September 2008 levels.

   United Kingdom
      


•
 
 Underlying earnings before tax declined to GBP 13 million, mainly on lower fund related charges in the pension business   


•
 
 Continued strong new life sales, up 5%   


•
 
 Higher margins lead to further increase in value of new business    Overview  Lower corporate bond and equity markets led to a decline in earnings from the United Kingdom. New life
sales held up well with strong sales of group pensions, annuities and unit-linked bonds. Value of new business also continued its recent strong growth, a result primarily of a shift in business mix to higher margin products.  Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax
declined in Q4 to GBP 13 million, due primarily to the impact of lower equity and corporate bond markets on fund related charges in AEGON’s unit linked pension business.   


•
 
 Earnings from Life & Protection decreased GBP 3 million to GBP 18 million as strong underlying growth was masked by a one-off benefit in the
comparable quarter last year;   


•
 
 A GBP 8 million loss from Pensions & Asset Management was the result mainly of lower fund related charges;   


•
 
 Distribution activities saw an increase in earnings to GBP 3 million as a result of cost containment and a release of incentive payments reserves.
 Net income  Lower underlying
earnings, underperformance of fair value items and losses on investments are the main drivers of the net loss of GBP 8 million in Q4. The fair value increase of guarantees embedded in the ‘Five-for Life’ variable annuity product
resulted, net of hedging, in a loss of GBP 15 million. In addition, losses on investments amounted to GBP 16 million, an accounting loss on a derivative instrument for which hedge accounting could no longer be applied.  Commissions and expenses  Total commissions and expenses were down 2%
due to a change in business mix. Operating expenses increased by 5% to GBP 114 million, mainly as a result of investments in the business and restructuring costs. As part of the group-wide cost savings program, operating expenses are expected
to be reduced in 2009.    Sales and deposits  In Q4 2008, AEGON had a 10% market share in the
life market in the United Kingdom (9% for full year 2008). New life sales continue to be strong in Q4, up 5% at GBP 289 million. Higher sales of annuities and group pensions were partly offset by weaker individual pension sales.   


•
 
 Life annualized premium production increased 35% to GBP 66 million, mainly as a result of continued strong sales of annuities in Q4, as AEGON continued its
focus on the rapidly-growing at-retirement market;   


•
 
 Sales of pensions declined 2% in Q4 to GBP 223 million, mainly due to lower individual pension sales. However, sales of group pensions and unit-linked bonds
continued to be strong (see Financial Supplement for more detail).  Total deposits declined to GBP 152 million as continued turmoil
on world financial markets resulted in lower sales of retail mutual funds and third party managed assets.  Value of new business  The value of new business (VNB) increased 25% to GBP 50 million, as margins showed further improvement in Q4. AEGON’s strategy in the United Kingdom is to move
more of its business to high-margin areas, such as annuities. As a result, the internal rate of return on new business in the United Kingdom rose to 14.0%.  Please refer to page 28for more detailed information on VNB.  Revenue generating investments  At the end of December 2008, revenue generating investments totaled GBP 47.1 billion, a decline of 1% from GBP 47.6 billion at the end of Q3 2008. The decrease reflects
mainly the weakness in equity markets.

•
 
 Underlying loss before tax of EUR 17 million – including a DPAC charge of EUR 43 million   


•
 
 Continued strong pension deposits in Central & Eastern Europe and retail mutual fund sales in China    Overview  Earnings from Other countries were affected by an accelerated DPAC amortization and equity impairments in
Taiwan. Deposits rose sharply, a result of the new asset management joint venture in China and continued strong growth in the company’s pension business in Central & Eastern Europe. Life sales were 34% lower, as declining equity
markets impacted single premium unit-linked sales in Poland and sales in Asia.  Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax from Other countries declined to a negative of EUR 17 million in Q4.   


•
 
 Earnings from Life & Protection were severely impacted by an accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs in Taiwan of EUR 43 million, a
reflection of a decline in interest rates and equity markets. Central & Eastern Europe and Spain, however, contributed resilient positive results;   


•
 
 The asset management joint venture in China performed well. As a result, earnings from mutual funds increased to EUR 2 million;   


•
 
 Earnings from General insurance were higher because of lower claims and a EUR 2 million reserve release in Hungary;   


•
 
 Earnings from associate companies declined as a higher contribution from CAM, AEGON’s Spanish associate, were more than offset by additional start-up costs at
AEGON’s joint ventures in India and a lower contribution from La Mondiale, AEGON’s French partner.  Net income
 The net loss of EUR 66 million in Q4 for Other countries includes an equity impairment of EUR 45 million, more than offsetting positive
results in Central & Eastern Europe and Spain. Sales of investments resulted in losses on investments of EUR 10 million.    Commissions and expenses  Commissions and expenses rose 45% in Q4 to EUR 175 million.   


•
 
 Operating expenses increased 25% as a result of continued growth in AEGON’s pension business in Central & Eastern Europe and further investment in the
company’s bank distribution operations in Spain;   


•
 
 Commissions, meanwhile, were down 24%;   


•
 
 Accelerated amortization of DPAC in Taiwan lead to an additional one-time amortization of EUR 43 million;   


•
 
 Deferred expenses declined, primarily because of lower production in Taiwan.  Excluding the DPAC charge in Taiwan, commissions and expenses increased only 9% to EUR 132 million.  Sales and deposits
 New life sales in Q4 2008 declined 34% to EUR 58 million.   


•
 
 In Central & Eastern Europe, sales of recurring premium life insurance rose 13% thanks to particularly strong performances in the Czech Republic and
Slovakia. Single premium sales in Poland were sharply lower, however, because of the declining equity market. Total new life sales in Central & Eastern Europe amounted to EUR 22 million, down 27%;   


•
 
 In Spain, sales of life insurance rose to EUR 22 million, due primarily to the extraordinary activity in AEGON’s Spanish life business, following changes
in pension legislation;   


•
 
 AEGON’s largest bank partner in Spain, which is an associate and therefore not consolidated, tripled sales to EUR 77 million (on a 100% basis), as a
result of a successful strategy to increase the insurance penetration ratio among their existing client base;   


•
 
 In Asia, new life sales decreased to EUR 13 million as increased sales in China were more than offset by a decline in Taiwan.

 Gross deposits rose 77% in Q4 2008 to EUR 394 million. Net deposits were, although down 24%, positive at EUR 90 million. The increase in gross deposits reflects:   


•
 
 The continued strong performance of AEGON’s asset management joint venture in China.   


•
 
 Strong growth in the company’s pension business in Central & Eastern Europe.  General insurance  Non-life sales in Hungary declined to EUR
11 million as a result of continued focus on writing profitable business in an increasingly competitive environment.  Value of new business 
 The value of new business (VNB) from Other countries decreased by 36% to EUR 36 million primarily as a result of lower sales. In Asia, the decrease in
VNB was mainly a reflection of lower sales. In Central & Eastern Europe, VNB declined on the back of lower sales in Hungary and Poland, as weak equity markets continued to impact sales levels. In Spain, VNB increased mainly as a result of
higher sales in CAM and positive changes in the business mix.    The internal rate of return in Asia rose to 15.8% as a result of
a change in product mix. The reduction of the internal rate of return to 29.8% in Central & Eastern Europe is mainly a reflection of lower sales in Poland. In Spain, AEGON’s bank distribution partnerships continued to deliver high
rates of return.  Please refer to page 28 for more detailed VNB information.  Revenue generating investments  Continued strong growth of the underlying businesses resulted in 2008 year-end
revenue generating investments of EUR 13.6 billion, a decline of 4% from the end of Q3 2008.

EXPLANATION 
 Certain assets held by AEGON Americas and AEGON The Netherlands are carried at fair value, and managed on a total
return basis, with no offsetting changes in the valuation of related liabilities. These include assets such as hedge funds, private equities, real estate limited partnerships, convertible bonds and structured products. Underlying earnings exclude
any over- or underperformance compared to management’s long-term expected return on these assets. Based on current holdings and asset class returns, the long-term expected return on an annual basis is 8-10%, depending on the asset class,
including cash income and market value changes. The expected earnings from these assets classes are net of DPAC where applicable.  In addition, certain
products offered by AEGON Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a fair value basis, including the segregated funds offered by AEGON Canada and the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities of AEGON USA. The earnings on
these products are impacted by movements in equity markets and risk free interest rates. Short-term developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings. Included in underlying earnings is a long-term expected return on
these products and any over- or underperformance compared to management’s expected return is excluded from underlying earnings. The fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on
these guarantees of AEGON the Netherlands and AEGON UK are excluded from underlying earnings.  The Holding includes certain issued bonds that are held at
fair value through profit or loss. The interest rate risk on these bonds is hedged using swaps. The change in AEGON’s credit spread resulted in a gain of EUR 30 mln in Q4 2008 on the fair value movement on these bonds.

 Notes:   


 1)
 Certain assets held by AEGON Americas and AEGON The Netherlands
are carried at fair value, and managed on a total return basis, with no offsetting changes in the valuation of related liabilities. These include assets such as hedge funds, private equities, real estate limited partnerships, convertible bonds and
structured products. Underlying earnings exclude any over- or underperformance compared to management’s long-term expected return on these assets. Based on current holdings and asset class returns, the long-term expected return on an annual
basis is 8-10%, depending on the asset class, including cash income and market value changes. The expected earnings from these assets classes are net of DPAC where applicable.  In addition, certain products offered by AEGON Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a fair value basis, including the segregated funds offered
by AEGON Canada and the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities of AEGON USA. The earnings on these products are impacted by movements in equity markets and risk free interest rates. Short-term developments in the financial
markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings. Included in underlying earnings is a long-term expected return on these products and any over- or underperformance compared to management’s expected return is excluded from underlying
earnings. The fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees of AEGON the Netherlands and AEGON UK are excluded from underlying earnings.  The Holding includes certain issued bonds that are held at fair value through profit or loss. The interest rate risk on these bonds is hedged using swaps.
The change in AEGON’s credit spread resulted in a gain of EUR 30 mln in Q4 2008 on the fair value movement on these bonds.   


 2)
 Net income refers to net income attributable to equity holders
of AEGON N.V. 


 3)
 New life sales is defined as new recurring premiums + 1/10 of
single premiums. 


 4)
 Deposits on and off balance sheet. 



 5)
 Return on equity is calculated by dividing the net underlying earnings after cost of leverage by the average
shareholders’ equity excluding the preferred shares and the revaluation reserve. 


 6)
 As of 2008, real estate for own use (both general account and for account of policyholders) has been reclassified from
revenue generating investments to other assets. 


 7)
 Capital securities that are denominated in foreign currencies are, for purposes of calculating the capital base ratio,
revalued to the period-end exchange rate. 


 8)
 All ratios exclude AEGON’s revaluation reserve. 


 9)
 Included in other non-operating income/(charges) are charges made to policyholders with respect to income tax. There is
an equal and opposite tax charge which is reported in the line Income tax attributable to policyholder return. 


 10)
 Includes production on investment contracts without a
discretionary participation feature of which the proceeds are not recognized as revenues but are directly added to our investment contract liabilities. 


 11)
 In order to maintain consistency in definitions, starting in the fourth quarter 2008, the net impact of the fair value
movements of guarantees and the related hedges in the Netherlands has been excluded from underlying earnings. Previously, differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness, were reported in
gain/losses on investments. Results from previous years have been adjusted. 


 12)
 APE = recurring premium + 1/10 single premium.

explanatory notes      The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements included in Appendix III have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim financial reporting’. It does not include all of the information required for full financial statements and should therefore be read together with
the 2007 consolidated financial statements of AEGON N.V. as included in AEGON’s Annual Report over 2007.  The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements included in Appendix III have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and those financial instruments (including derivatives) and financial liabilities that
have been measured at fair value.  As of January 1, 2008, AEGON reclassified, on the face of its balance sheet, the real estate for own use from
Investments general account and Investments for account of policyholders to Other assets and receivables. In addition, AEGON reclassified cash flows from real estate held for own use as cash flows from operating activities to investing activities,
to the extent that they relate to real estate that is occupied by AEGON’s own employees. The comparative 2007 information has been adjusted accordingly. This change reduced Investments general account by EUR 330 million and Investments for
account of policyholder by EUR 141 million with an offsetting increase in Other assets and receivables of EUR 471 million.  All other accounting
policies and methods of computation applied in the interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the 2007 consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. For AEGON this is equal to IFRS as published by the International Accounting Standards Board.    The published figures in these interim financial statements are
unaudited.  Condensed consolidated income statement  The result from financial transactions in 2008 amounted to a loss of EUR 28.2 billion compared to a gain of EUR 4.5 billion in 2007. This decrease primarily reflects losses on investments for account of policyholders. These losses are
offset by a decrease in the benefits and expenses line which decreases from an amount of EUR 41.8 billion in 2007 to EUR 7.0 billion in 2008.  Capital
and funding  The capital management section, on page 3 provides information on issuances, repurchases and repayments of debt and equity securities
during the current interim reporting period.  Investment impairments  Page 6 of the results release includes information on net impairments recognized in Q4 of 2008.  Condensed consolidated
statement of changes in equity  Page 3 of the results release includes information on the movements in shareholder’s equity.  Critical accounting estimates  Fair value measurement 
 Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities has been subject of industry-wide discussions between preparers, regulators and users of
financial statements. The distressed markets in the second half of 2008 resulted in challenges related to the fair value measurement of financial instruments because of far less liquidity in the market, forced sales resulting from deleveraging
activities and asset/liability programs.

     Equity market sensitivities
 Fluctuations in the equity markets have affected AEGON’s profitability, capital position and sales of equity related products in the past and
may continue to do so. Exposure to equity markets exists in both assets and liabilities. Equity exposure exists through direct equity investments, guarantees on minimum return or accumulation guarantees in insurance and investment contracts and
impact on fee income related to charges on policyholder account balances.  A significant assumption related to estimated gross profits on variable
annuities and variable life insurance products in the United States and some of the smaller country units, is the annual long-term growth rate of the underlying assets. As equity  
markets do not move in a systematic manner, assumptions as to the long-term growth rate are made after considering the effects of short-term variances from
the long-term assumptions (a reversion to the mean assumption). The reconsideration of this assumption may affect the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule, referred to as DPAC or Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) unlocking. The difference
between the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule and the revised schedule, which is based on estimates of actual and future gross profits, is recognized in the income statement as an expense or a benefit in the period of determination. At
September 30, 2008, the reversion to the mean assumptions for variable   
   Local knowledge. Global power. | Page 37 of 42 





 
products, primarily variable annuities in the United States were: gross long-term equity growth rate of 9%; gross short-term growth rate of 15%. The
reversion period for the short-term rate is five years. The significant decreases in equity markets in Q4 2008 (S&P 500: -23%) resulted in a 25% gross short-term growth rate. This rate was unlocked to a 15% annual short-term growth rate which
led to a pre tax charge of approximately USD 566 million.    The results of equity sensitivity tests are non-linear. The main
reason for this is due to equity options sold to clients that are embedded in some of AEGON’s products and that more severe scenarios could cause accelerated DAC amortization and guaranteed minimum benefits provisioning, while moderate
scenarios may not.

       Guarantees valuation  Guarantees embedded in certain pension, life and variable annuity contracts of AEGON USA
and AEGON The Netherlands are measured at fair value. These contracts include long-term guarantees that are embedded in the contracts which for accounting purposes are valued separately.  For financial reporting purposes AEGON distinguishes between the following types of minimum guarantees:   


•
 
 Financial guarantees: these guarantees are treated as bifurcated embedded derivatives, valued at fair value and presented as derivatives;
  


•
 
 Total return annuities: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, valued at fair value and presented as part of insurance contracts;
  


•
 
 Life contingent guarantees in the US: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, valued in accordance with insurance accounting and presented
together with insurance liabilities; and 


•
 
 Life contingent guarantees in The Netherlands: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, valued at fair value and presented together with the
underlying insurance contracts which are also valued at fair value.  Fair value movements of guarantees and related hedges are recognized
in operating earnings; the fair value movements are excluded from underlying earnings.  Fair value guarantees contributed a net loss before tax of EUR
139 million (Q4 2007: EUR 134 million) to operating earnings. In Q4 2008 the total guarantee reserves increased by EUR 3.0 billion including an offset related to the impact of credit spread. Hedges offset related to this increase amounted to
EUR 2.9 billion.

 Business combinations  On February 26, 2008, AEGON has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of Ankara Emeklilik Anonim Sirketi
(Ankara Emeklilik), a Turkish life insurance and pension provider, from Polis Bakim ve Yardim Sandigi. The transaction, subject to regulatory approval in Turkey, was closed in the third quarter of 2008. Ankara Emeklilik has a well-established
presence in the Turkish life insurance and private pension market, with over 54,000 pension fund members and approximately EUR 35 million in assets under management (Source: Pension Monitoring Center—February 18, 2008). Ankara Emeklilik
sells its products and services through a variety of different channels and has an agreement in place to distribute through a nationwide network of 236 branches belonging to Şekerbank.  On April 21, 2008, AEGON and China’s Industrial Securities have completed the establishment of their asset management joint venture following the recent final
approval by the regulatory authorities. Under the agreement, AEGON has acquired a 49% interest in Industrial Fund Management Company (IFMC), a Chinese mutual fund manager with approximately EUR 3 billion assets under management as of March 31,
2008. Industrial Securities, one of China’s leading securities companies, will retain the remaining 51% of IFMC. The initial agreement was announced on May 28, 2007. The joint venture will be renamed AEGON Industrial Fund Management
Company. Both shareholders will be equally represented in the Board of Directors. The current management team, led by CEO Yang Dong, will continue to lead AEGON Industrial FMC with the objective of becoming one of the top players in the Chinese fund
management market. Over the past two years, assets under management have increased from EUR 600 million to EUR 3 billion.  On June 30, 2008,
AEGON completed the 100% purchase of the registered capital of UNIQA Asset Management Company and Heller-Saldo 2000 Pension Fund Management Company, both Hungarian entities, from UNIQA Insurance Company.    The agreement was signed on February 21, 2008 and it was subject to regulatory approval which was subsequently received. Following the acquisition, assets under management increased by approximately EUR
300 million (Source: Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA) 3Q 2007 figures).  On June 30, 2008, AEGON Hungary Pension Fund merged with
‘Uniqa and Public Service Pension Fund’. As a result of the merger, AEGON is the second largest pension fund provider in Hungary.  In July 2008,
AEGON finalized the acquisition of the Turkish life insurance and pension provider Ankara Emeklilik.  On September 30, 2008, AEGON has signed an
agreement to create a new joint venture with Caja Navarra to distribute health products.  In Q3 2008, AEGON Religare started life operations in India.
AEGON and Ranbaxy Promoter group jointly entered the life insurance business in India. AEGON holds a 26% stake in the life company.  In October 2008, AEGON
signed an agreement to acquire a 50% stake in Brazilian life insurer Mongeral SA Seguros e Prevedência, further strengthening the company’s position in the fast-growing Latin American market.  On October 31, 2008, AEGON has completed the acquisition of a 50% stake in the life insurance and pension company of the Catalan-based savings bank Caixa Terrassa.
The partnership gives AEGON access for the first time to Catalonia, one of Spain’s wealthiest regions with a population of more than seven million people.  In December 2008, AEGON has completed the acquisition of the Polish pension company PTE Skarbiec Emerytura SA, after receiving final regulatory approval. AEGON initiated the transaction in June 2007 as part of a broader strategy to
strengthen the company’s businesses in Central & Eastern Europe.

 On June 30, 2008, AEGON completed the planned merger of its pension fund management company PTE AEGON with BRE Bank’s PTE Skarbiec-Emerytura. As part of the merger agreement, AEGON acquired BRE Bank’s shareholding in the
newly combined pension fund. With the acquisition, AEGON became Poland’s fifth largest pension fund manager, with a market share of approximately 6%. The combined fund has some 800,000 members and more than EUR 1.8 billion in assets under
management.  Commitments and contingencies  There have
been no material changes in contingent assets and liabilities reported in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of AEGON.  Capital management 
 On December 1, 2008 AEGON completed the transaction to secure EUR 3 billion in additional core capital from Vereniging AEGON, funded by the Dutch
State. The additional capital for AEGON is part of broader support that the Dutch government agreed to make available to fundamentally sound and viable banks and insurers in the Netherlands.  AEGON accessed the capital through its largest shareholder, Association AEGON, which was set up precisely for the purpose of protecting the long-term interest of the
company’s stakeholders.  The additional funds from Vereniging AEGON strengthened AEGON’s capital buffer – an important safeguard against any
further downturn in global equity and credit markets.    In return for the additional capital, AEGON issued special
non-voting securities to Vereniging AEGON. Vereniging AEGON will use income from these securities to service its loan from the Dutch State. Of the total EUR 3 billion, AEGON has the right to return EUR 1 billion to the State at any point before
December 1, 2009 should financial markets improve and the company decides it no longer needs this extra EUR 1 billion in capital.  Importantly, this
arrangement will ensure there is no change to AEGON’s overall ownership structure and will avoid dilution of voting rights for existing shareholders. The Dutch State will not become a shareholder in AEGON, but the government has appointed two
representatives to the company’s Supervisory Board.  Events after the balance sheet date  In January 2009, AEGON has agreed to acquire Banca Transilvania’s 50% shareholding in BT AEGON, the two companies’ jointly-owned Romanian pension business.
AEGON will pay approximately EUR 11 million for the stake, which will give AEGON full control of the pension business.  AEGON and Banca Transilvania
(BT) will remain partners. As part of the transaction, the two companies will sign a distribution agreement covering both life insurance and pension products.

   Disclaimers
     Cautionary note regarding non-GAAP measures  This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures: net
operating earnings, operating earnings before tax, (net) underlying earnings and value of new business. The reconciliation of net operating earnings and operating earnings before tax to the most comparable IFRS measures is provided on page 35. A
reconciliation of (net) underlying earnings to operating earnings before tax is provided on page 26. Value of new business is not based on IFRS, which are used to report AEGON’s quarterly statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for
IFRS financial measures. AEGON believes that these non-GAAP measures, together with the IFRS information, provide a meaningful measure for the investment community to evaluate AEGON’s business relative to the businesses of our peers.
