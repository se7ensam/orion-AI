ratio increased further to 211%  Statement Alex Wynaendts, CEO  AEGON’s improved capital position, the strength of our franchise and return to profit in the third quarter are evidence that the actions we initiated a
year ago were the right ones at the right time. On November 30 we will repay EUR 1 billion to the Dutch government, an important first step toward full repayment of the capital support AEGON received last year. We are pleased that our strong
capital position has enabled us to take this step while continuing to maintain a larger capital buffer, a necessary precaution in the current environment. We are also encouraged by the improved sales and net deposits for the quarter and the
continued confidence of our customers. Moreover, we have achieved our full-year cost savings target of EUR 150 million and further reduced AEGON’s risk to financial markets. AEGON today is in a strong position and we remain committed to
further executing our strategy to position our businesses for long-term growth and profitability.  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

   STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS AND SHORT-TERM PRIORITIES      AEGON has set out three long-term strategic priorities:   


1.
To reallocate capital toward businesses with higher growth and return prospects;   


2.
To improve growth and returns from existing businesses;   


3.
To manage AEGON as an international company.  AEGON further aims to reduce its earnings sensitivity to financial markets to generate more stable earnings going forward.  Portfolio review  AEGON continues to assess its businesses to ensure they meet requirements in terms of earnings growth, cash
flow and return on capital potential. As a result of this portfolio review AEGON is running off its institutional spread-based and auto credit businesses in the US, its group risk business in the UK, and has sold its Taiwanese life insurance
operations.  Cost measures  AEGON made further progress in implementing cost saving measures and has achieved its 2009 target of EUR 150 million. Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2009 declined by 5%, excluding the impact of restructuring charges,
increased employee benefit plan expenses and currency effects.  Recently, AEGON announced that it will reorganize its Dutch sales
organization, which will result in an annual cost savings of EUR 15 million. This reorganization involves compulsory redundancies and will result in a charge of EUR 20 million.  Capital preservation  During Q3 2009, a further EUR 0.9 billion of capital was released
from AEGON’s businesses, bringing the total for the first nine months of 2009 to EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion since the initiation of the capital preservation program in June 2008.  Capital & risk management  Excess capital   







   ¡
  
Excess capital above AA capital adequacy requirements amounted to EUR 4.8 billion, up from EUR 3.5 billion at the end of Q2 2009. In normal circumstances AEGON aims to maintain
an excess capital of EUR 1.5 to 2 billion. However, in the current environment AEGON aims to maintain a substantially larger capital buffer.




   ¡
  
De-risking and capital efficiency measures totaling EUR 0.9 billion and statutory earnings of EUR 0.4 billion further added to AEGON’s excess capital position, partly offset
by rating migration in the United States of EUR 0.2 billion, impairment charges of EUR 0.2 billion and other items. AEGON has included in its Q3 2009 results the recently announced capital management transaction that releases approximately USD
650 million of additional regulatory capital to its US operations.




   ¡
  
AEGON successfully completed a EUR 1 billion equity issue on August 13, 2009. The proceeds of which will be used to repay one-third of the EUR 3 billion of core capital the
company secured last year through its largest shareholder, Vereniging AEGON and funded by the Dutch State. As announced, AEGON will repay this EUR 1 billion on November 30.
 IFRS core capital   







   ¡
  
At the end of September 2009, core capital, excluding the revaluation reserves, totaled EUR 16.4 billion or 80% of the total capital base, well above AEGON’s self-imposed
minimum target of 70%7,8.




   ¡
  
Core capital, including the revaluation reserve, amounted to EUR 14.6 billion, consisting of EUR 11.6 billion in shareholders’ equity and EUR 3 billion in convertible core
capital securities.

   ¡
  
AEGON’s revaluation reserves improved by a significant amount of EUR 3.3 billion, during Q3 2009 to a negative EUR 1.8 billion at September 30, 2009. Approximately 85%
of the improvement of the revaluation reserves is related to the narrowing of credit spreads and approximately 15% is the result of lower risk-free interest rates. 
 AEGON recently submitted a plan, through the Dutch Ministry of Finance, to the European Commission to
demonstrate that its businesses are fundamentally sound and viable. This plan is a requirement for all financial institutions that received state support during the financial crisis. The timing and outcome of this process have not been specified.
 Improved risk profile  To
reduce AEGON’s sensitivity to financial markets, AEGON has substantially reduced its equity and credit market risk. In addition, AEGON lowered its long-term interest rate risk by selling the Taiwanese life insurance business.  Equity market sensitivity  During Q3 2009,
AEGON further reduced exposure to equity markets by hedging 50% of the indirect equity exposure embedded in guarantees within its Dutch business, using futures and limiting future earnings volatility.  Credit market sensitivity  As a result of
the decision to reduce sensitivity to financial markets, AEGON is running off its institutional spread-based business, reducing its exposure to credit risk. By the end of 2010, these balances will have decreased by approximately USD 20 billion,
freeing up approximately USD 0.8 billion of capital.  In order to fund these outflows, assets from the institutional spread-based business
have been transferred internally to other businesses in the United States in exchange for cash. As a result, the institutional spread-based business realizes a negative spread on these assets which negatively impacts underlying earnings. In the
first nine months of 2009, AEGON has reduced its institutional spread-based balances by USD 9 billion.  Following the compression of credit
spreads, AEGON has decided to reduce its exposure to credit derivatives, further reducing AEGON’s earnings and capital volatility to financial markets.  Manage AEGON as an international company   







   ¡
  
AEGON’s new global asset management business formally started on October 1, combining its international asset management operations in one international organization.





   ¡
  
A European data center was opened in the United Kingdom, bringing together the data centers from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, saving costs and significantly improving
efficiency.




   ¡
  
To further improve marketing effectiveness, AEGON Scottish Equitable will be rebranded solely as AEGON. Brand awareness in the United Kingdom has increased strongly since AEGON
became the lead partner of British tennis.




   ¡
  
Leveraging on expertise in the United States and the United Kingdom, further progress has been made in developing variable annuity products. Product launches are planned in Q4
both in the Netherlands and Japan.

   OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS       
 Underlying earnings before tax  In Q3 2009, underlying earnings before tax amounted to EUR 351 million. Underlying earnings were impacted by de-risking measures implemented to counter the effects of the financial crisis. These measures
impacted Q3 earnings by approximately EUR 40 million. Underlying earnings before tax were also impacted by lower equity markets and by several exceptional items (EUR 66 million). Excluding exceptional items, underlying earnings would have been EUR
417 million for the third quarter.  The exceptional items were:   







   ¡
  
Provisions related to a program to improve the consistency of customer records in the United Kingdom of EUR 43 million;




   ¡
  
Accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition cost (DPAC) of EUR 23 million in the fixed annuity business, as a result of the internal asset transfers related to
the run-off of the institutional spread-based business in the United States.
 Underlying earnings before tax in the Americas decreased 30% to USD 403 million compared with Q3
2008, as a result of lower product spreads, reduced fees from lower asset balances, increased employee benefit plan expenses and accelerated DPAC in the fixed annuity business. Product spreads in the Institutional spread-based business have been
significantly reduced due to asset transfers to other US businesses in exchange for cash. In Q3 2008, the Americas results included DPAC charges related to variable annuities and unfavorable mortality experience for Life Reinsurance.  In the Netherlands, underlying earnings before tax increased to EUR 102 million, or 38%, compared with Q3 2008, primarily the result of higher
investment income in the life and pensions businesses.  In the United Kingdom, underlying earnings before tax decreased compared to Q3 2008 to
a loss of GBP 11 million. This was mainly the result of an exceptional charge of GBP 38 million related to a program to improve the consistency of customer records.  Underlying earnings before tax from Other countries totaled EUR 42 million. Excluding the results of AEGON’s Taiwanese Life business, which was sold in Q2 2009, underlying earnings before tax were up
60%. This increase was mainly driven by improved results for CAM Vida, one of AEGON’s Spanish bank partners, and the Life business in Central & Eastern Europe (CEE).  Interest charges and other, included in underlying earnings before tax, represent holding expenses and amounted to a charge of EUR 69 million. The increase compared with Q3 2008 is mainly attributable to
higher interest expenses.  Fair value items  In the Americas, fair value items showed an underperformance of USD 97 million (EUR 76 million). The overperformance of fair value assets, total return annuities, credit derivatives and GMWB
guarantees, were more than offset by the result of AEGON’s equity hedge program related to its retail variable annuity portfolio in the United States which amounted to a loss of USD 252 million (EUR 184 million). In the Netherlands, fair
value items over-performed by EUR 39 million due to the positive impact of movements in the fair value of guarantees and related hedges. Fair value items for the holding consist of three bonds issued by AEGON, which, together with related
hedges, are held at fair value through profit or loss. Further narrowing of AEGON’s own credit spread during Q3 2009 resulted in a loss of EUR 27 million.

 Results on investments  During Q3 2009, AEGON recorded losses on investments totaling EUR 100 million. Trading gains on the bond portfolios in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were more than offset by trading losses in the
Americas and depreciation of direct residential real estate investments in the Netherlands.  Impairment charges  Net impairment charges decreased significantly compared with Q3 2008 to EUR 285 million. However, net impairments remained higher than AEGON’s average
long-term impairment expectations. Impairments on US housing market related assets of EUR 74 million were considerably lower compared with previous quarters. In the United Kingdom impairments increased to EUR 80 million, related to
corporate credit investments.  Income tax  The third quarter of 2009 included a tax gain of EUR 154 million related to cross border intercompany reinsurance transactions between Ireland and the United States. These reinsurance transactions
are accounted for at fair value in both tax jurisdictions. While losses in the United States were taxed at 35%, gains in Ireland were taxed at 12.5%. The tax gains related to these internal transactions, totaling EUR 399 million in the first
nine months of 2009, are a partial reversal of the EUR 490 million of tax charges for the full year 2008.  Net income 
Net income increased to EUR 145 million compared to a loss in Q3 2008, primarily the result of improved results of fair value items, lower impairment
charges and the reversal of prior year tax charges.  Commissions and expenses  Operating expenses declined 2% in Q3 2009 compared with Q3 2008. Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2009 declined by 5%, excluding the impact of
restructuring charges, increased employee benefit plan expenses and currency effects. Total commissions and expenses in the first nine months increased primarily as a result of higher DPAC amortization in the Americas related to lower equity markets
in Q1 2009. Consistent with lower sales levels, fewer expenses were deferred and commissions decreased compared to the first three quarters of 2008.  New life sales  Total new life sales were up 3% compared with Q2 2009 to EUR 484 million as a result of higher single
premium sales. In the Americas, retail life sales increased by 11% as a result of strong term life sales and higher universal life sales, while in the Netherlands the increase in sales was driven by group pension contracts. In the United Kingdom,
sales declined, mainly as a result of the closure of the group risk business. In Central & Eastern Europe (CEE), new life sales increased 21% compared to Q2 2009, while in Spain sales declined during the quarter. In Asia sales were level
with Q2 2009.  Deposits  Total gross deposits, excluding institutional guaranteed products, increased to EUR 6.8 billion, or 20% compared with Q2 2009. The increase was the result of strong pension and retail mutual fund deposits in the United States, higher
savings deposits in the Netherlands, new asset management contracts in the United Kingdom and higher mutual fund sales in China. As anticipated, gross deposits of fixed annuities were lower as crediting rates have been lowered, while variable
annuity deposits declined in both the Americas and the United Kingdom. Net deposits, excluding institutional guaranteed products, increased to EUR 2 billion, mainly due to the large increase in deposits and improved persistency in pensions and asset
management.

 Value of new business  Value of new business amounted to EUR 169 million in Q3 2009, a decline of 7% compared with Q2 2009. VNB in the Netherlands increased as a result of higher sales volumes and improved margins, and in
the Americas, VNB increased slightly in local currency. However, these increases were more than offset by declines in the United Kingdom and Other countries, as well as currency effects.  Revenue-generating investments  Revenue-generating investments increased to EUR 354 billion
during Q3 2009, an increase of 4% compared with Q2 2009. This is the result of a further rise in equity markets combined with narrowing credit spreads and slightly lower interest rate levels in addition to net inflows.  SALES

 Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax decreased to USD 403 million compared to Q3 2008 and include lower institutional products spreads, increased employee benefit plan expenses of USD 63 million and
lower fee based revenues.   







   ¡
  
Underlying earnings before tax from Life & Protection declined to USD 260 million. The positive mortality experience was more than offset by lower persistency and
increased employee benefit plan expenses (USD 33 million);




   ¡
  
Individual Savings & Retirement underlying earnings before tax increased to USD 104 million, primarily due to extraordinary 2008 reserve strengthening and
accelerated DPAC amortization in the variable annuity business. The increased equity markets in Q3 2009 did not lead to a reserve release on the variable annuity book, but resulted in lowering AEGON’s medium-term equity market return
assumptions to 8%, below the long-term assumption of 9%. Fixed annuity underlying earnings before tax were impacted by lower yields from higher than average cash balances and an exceptional DPAC charge of USD 31 million, related to the internal
transfer of assets. Underlying earnings before tax in Q3 2009 were also impacted by USD 11 million from increased employee benefit plan expenses;




   ¡
  
Pensions & Asset Management underlying earnings before tax decreased to USD 10 million, due mainly to reduced fees as a result of lower equity markets and higher
cash balances. Underlying earnings before tax also included USD 11 million from increased employee benefit plan expenses;




   ¡
  
Institutional products spreads have declined significantly due to the build up of cash required to run-off the business as well as the amortization of unrealized losses on assets
transferred to other portfolios in exchange for cash. The amortization consolidates to zero in aggregate, however, it was established to mirror a non-distressed market value transfer of the assets between portfolios.




   ¡
  
Underlying earnings before tax from Life Reinsurance increased to USD 20 million primarily due to favorable mortality relative to Q3 2008.
 Net income  Net income improved to USD 232 million for Q3 2009 compared to a net loss of USD 578 million for the comparable period last year.  The underperformance of fair value items of USD 97 million is primarily the result of the negative impact of USD 252 million related to a macro hedge. This hedge was implemented during Q2 2009
to reduce the sensitivity of AEGON’s capital position to equity market movements within AEGON’s retail variable annuity portfolio. These hedge instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. Most other fair value items
overperformed their expected returns.  Realized losses on investments amounted to USD 98 million, resulting primarily from trading in the
bond portfolio.

 Although net impairments were at their lowest level in five quarters, they continue to be above
AEGON’s average long-term impairment expectations and totaled USD 287 million, of which USD 117 million was related to structured assets.  Net income also included a tax gain of USD 211 million related to cross border intercompany reinsurance treaties. This gain is a partial reversal of previous tax charges of USD 718 million on
these internal transactions in 2008.  Commissions and expenses  Total commissions and expenses increased by 28% compared with Q3 2008 as a result of higher DAC amortization charges. Operating expenses were level with the third quarter last year. However, operating
expenses for the first nine months of 2009, excluding employee benefit plan costs and restructuring charges, decreased by 9%.  Sales and
deposits  Total new life sales increased 10% to USD 202 million compared with Q2 2009. Retail new life sales increased 11%, primarily
as a result of strong term life sales. This is the second quarter of growth after five consecutive quarters of declining retail life sales. Life reinsurance sales increased 4%, while activity in the BOLI/COLI market remained limited in the current
economic environment.  Sales of accident and health products declined by 8% compared with Q2 2009, due to the run-off of the auto credit
business.  In line with management expectations, fixed annuity deposits declined to USD 691 million as a result of lower crediting rates
offered to customers. Variable annuity deposits declined to USD 912 million, a strong result considering recent product repricing. Mutual fund sales increased substantially, mainly as a result of improved equity markets.  Pension deposits of USD 2.7 billion continue to be strong taking into account lower takeover balances due to lower equity markets compared to last year. As
a result of the decision to run-off the institutional spread-based balances, no new spread-based business is being sold.  Value of new
business  Value of new business increased 2% over Q2 2009 to USD 92 million as higher VNB from life, pensions and variable annuities
more than offset the decline in VNB from lower fixed annuity production. The internal rate of return improved over Q2 2009 to 12.1%.  Revenue-generating investments  Revenue-generating investments for the Americas increased 5% during Q3 2009 to USD 310 billion,
as a decline in spread-based institutional balances was more than compensated by improvements of financial markets and continued net inflows.

NETHERLANDS       







   ¡
  
Net income improved to EUR 74 million as fair value items turn positive




   ¡
  
Underlying earnings before tax increased to EUR 102 million due to higher life and pensions profits




   ¡
  
New life sales increased 63% sequentially, driven by higher group pensions sales




   ¡
  
Value of new business increased to EUR 51 million, the result of higher margins and volumes
 Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax increased 38% to EUR 102 million compared with Q3 2008.   







   ¡
  
Underlying earnings before tax from Life & Protection increased to EUR 70 million as higher investment income in the Life business more than compensated for lower
underwriting results in Accident & Health. Q3 2008 included costs for modifying unit-linked insurance products of EUR 28 million;




   ¡
  
Continued fierce competition in the savings market and low short-term interest rates led the Savings business to report an underlying loss before tax of EUR 8
million;




   ¡
  
Pensions & Asset Management underlying earnings before tax increased to EUR 38 million. Higher investment income was partly offset by lower technical
results;




   ¡
  
Underlying earnings before tax from Distribution decreased to EUR 3 million due to a slowdown in the real estate and mortgage market;




   ¡
  
Adverse claims experience in Fire and pressure on premiums in Motor resulted in an underlying loss before tax of EUR 2 million for General Insurance.
 Net income  Net income improved to EUR 74 million. Fair value items in Q3 2009 included a net benefit of EUR 41 million, due to the positive impact of movements in the fair value of guarantees and related
hedges. Losses on investments amounted to EUR 34 million as depreciation of AEGON’s direct real estate portfolio was only partly offset by gains on bonds. Impairment charges have improved considerably over recent quarters. Impairments
during the quarter were mainly related to private equity investments.  Commissions and expenses  Commissions and expenses decreased slightly compared with Q3 2008. Cost savings measures are being implemented and are on track to reach the 2009 target.
Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2009 decreased by 3% compared with last year.  Sales and deposits  Pension sales totaling EUR 33 million were strong, mainly as a result of several new contracts. The group pension market in the Netherlands, however,
proves to be volatile. Life sales were EUR 19 million, level with Q2 2009. Of the new mortgage production, 70% was sold with a national mortgage guarantee (NHG). Gross deposits were up strongly compared with Q2 2009. Net deposits turned
positive as a result of the increased savings deposits.  Value of new business  Higher sales volumes and margins in life, mortgages and pensions led to an increased value of new business of EUR 51 million. The improvement of the internal
rate of return was mainly driven by a shift in business mix.  Revenue-generating investments  Compared to the end of Q2 2009, revenue-generating investments increased 6% to EUR 69.7 billion as a result of lower interest rates, improved credit spreads
and net inflows.

   UNITED KINGDOM       







   ¡

  
Net loss of GBP 33 million, mainly driven by impairment charges




   ¡

  
Underlying loss before tax of GPB 11 million, mainly as a result of exceptional charges




   ¡

  
Net deposits substantially increased as a result of several new asset management mandates




   ¡

  
Value of new business decreased to GBP 29 million, mainly due to lower annuity margins
 Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax decreased compared with Q3 2008 to an underlying loss before tax of GBP 11 million, mainly as a result of an exceptional charge of GBP 38 million related to a
program to improve consistency of customer records.   







   ¡
  
Underlying earnings before tax from Life & Protection amounted to GBP 10 million, in-line with the comparable period last year;




   ¡
  
Pensions & Asset Management recorded an underlying loss before tax of GBP 18 million as growth of the business was more than offset by the exceptional charge of GBP
38 million related to a program to improve consistency of customer records;




   ¡
  
Distribution experienced lower income due to difficult market conditions for mortgage and investment products, which resulted in an underlying loss before tax for the quarter of
GBP 3 million.
 Regarding the program to improve the quality and consistency of customer records and operational
effectiveness, an analysis of customer records is being conducted. This analysis is expected to be completed by the end of 2009. Two examples of issues identified which will be addressed during this program are: improving the quality of records to
enable AEGON to return money to former customers who have unclaimed assets, and rebating fund charges to customers who have overpaid. AEGON is determined to resolve these issues during this program.  Net income  AEGON reported a loss of GBP
33 million in the United Kingdom in Q3 2009, primarily due to an underlying loss and higher impairment charges. Gains on investments totaled GBP 26 million, including a GBP 14 million gain on a derivative instrument for which hedge
accounting could no longer be applied. Impairments increased to GBP 70 million, related to corporate credit investments.  Commissions
and expenses  Total commissions and expenses increased 4% compared with Q3 2008, while operating expenses increased 9% as a result of
higher restructuring costs and a rise in risk and regulatory costs.  Sales and deposits  New life sales decreased by 2% to GBP 218 million compared to Q2 2009 as increases in annuity and personal pensions sales were offset by lower group
pensions and employee benefit production. The latter is a result of the decision to close the group risk business. Gross deposits substantially increased over Q2 2009 to GBP 491 million as a result of several new asset management mandates.
 Value of new business  Value
of new business in Q3 2009 declined to GBP 29 million, primarily a result of lower margins on annuity products. The internal rate of return in the United Kingdom remained stable compared to Q2 2009 at 13.4%.  Revenue-generating investments  Revenue-generating investments increased 15% to GBP 54.2 billion, primarily as a result of a strong recovery in financial markets.

 Notes:   


1)
 Certain assets held by AEGON Americas, AEGON The Netherlands and AEGON UK are carried at fair value, and managed on a total return basis, with no
offsetting changes in the valuation of related liabilities. These include assets such as hedge funds, private equities, real estate limited partnerships, convertible bonds and structured products. Underlying earnings exclude any over- or
underperformance compared to management’s long-term expected return on these assets. Based on current holdings and asset class returns, the long-term expected return on an annual basis is 8-10%, depending on the asset class, including cash
income and market value changes. The expected earnings from these asset classes are net of DPAC where applicable.  In addition, certain products offered by AEGON Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a fair value basis, including the segregated funds offered by AEGON Canada and the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities of
AEGON USA. The earnings on these products are impacted by movements in equity markets and risk free interest rates. Short-term developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings. Included in underlying earnings is a
long-term expected return on these products, and any over- or underperformance compared to management’s expected return is excluded from underlying earnings. The fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of
derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees of AEGON the Netherlands and Variable Annuities Europe (included in Other countries) are excluded from underlying earnings.  The Holding includes certain issued bonds that are held at fair value through profit or loss. The interest rate risk on these bonds is hedged
using swaps. The change in AEGON’s credit spread resulted in a loss of EUR 27 million in Q3 2009 on the fair value movement on these bonds. 


2)
 Net income refers to net income attributable to equity holders of AEGON N.V. 


3)
 New life sales is defined as new recurring premiums + 1/10 of single premiums. 


4)
 Deposits on and off balance sheet. 


5)
 Return on equity is calculated by dividing the net underlying earnings after cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity excluding the
preferred shares and the revaluation reserve. 


6)
 In order to maintain consistency in definitions, starting in the fourth quarter 2008, the net impact of the fair value movements of guarantees and the
related hedges in the Netherlands has been excluded from underlying earnings. Previously, differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness, were reported in gain/losses on investments. Results from
previous years have been adjusted. 


7)
 Capital securities that are denominated in foreign currencies are, for purposes of calculating the capital base ratio, revalued to the period-end
exchange rate. 


8)
 All ratios exclude AEGON’s revaluation reserve. 


9)
 Included in other non-operating income/(charges) are charges made to policyholders with respect to income tax.  There is an equal and opposite tax charge which is reported in the line Income tax attributable to policyholder return. 


10)
 Includes production on investment contracts without a discretionary participation feature of which the proceeds are not recognized as revenues but are
directly added to our investment contract liabilities. 


11)
 APE = recurring premium + 1/10 single premium. 


12)
 PVNBP: Present Value New Business Premium.   


a)
The calculation of the IGD (Insurance Group Directive) capital surplus and ratio are based on Solvency I capital requirements on IFRS for entities within the EU
(Pillar I for AEGON UK), and local regulatory solvency measurements for non-EU entities. Specifically, required capital for the life insurance companies in the US is calculated as two times the upper end of the Company Action Level range
(200%) as applied by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the US. The methodology to calculate the ratio for the Netherlands has been adjusted to include the excess value above the technical provisions, calculated according to
the local regulatory liability adequacy test, as of Q2 2009. This method has been refined in the third quarter - the comparable IGD ratio as per end of Q2 2009 would have been 194% (reported Q2 2009: 202%). 


b)
The results in this release are unaudited.  Currencies  Income statement items: average rate 1 EUR = USD 1.3720 (2008: USD 1.5197).  Income statement items: average rate 1 EUR = GBP 0.8855 (2008: GBP 0.7825).  Balance sheet items: closing rate 1 EUR = USD 1.4643 (2008: USD 1.4303; year-end 2008: USD 1.3917).  Balance sheet items: closing rate 1 EUR = GBP 0.9093 (2008: GBP 0.7903; year-end 2008: GBP 0.9525).

   Disclaimers      Cautionary note regarding non-GAAP measures  This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures: net operating earnings, operating earnings before tax, underlying earnings before tax, net underlying earnings and value of new business. The reconciliation of underlying
earnings before tax and operating earnings before tax to the most comparable IFRS measures is provided on page 8. A reconciliation of (net) underlying earnings to operating earnings before tax is provided on page 23. Value of new business is not
based on IFRS, which are used to report AEGON’s quarterly statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for IFRS financial measures. Reference is made to the assumptions included in AEGON’s Embedded Value 2008 Report dated May 14,
2009. AEGON believes that these non-GAAP measures, together with the IFRS information, provide a meaningful measure for the investment community to evaluate AEGON’s business relative to the businesses of our peers.  Local currencies and constant currency exchange rates  This press release contains certain information about our results and financial condition in USD for the Americas and GBP for the United Kingdom, because those businesses operate and are managed primarily
in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about us
presented in EUR, which is the currency of our primary financial statements.  Forward-looking statements  The statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following are words that identify such forward-looking statements: aim, believe, estimate, target, intend, on track, may, expect, anticipate, predict, project, counting on, plan, continue, want, forecast, goal,
should, would, is confident, will, and similar expressions as they relate to our company. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which merely reflect company expectations at the time of writing. Actual results may
differ materially from expectations conveyed in forward-looking statements due to changes caused by various risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following:   







   ¡
  
Changes in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom;




   ¡
  
Changes in the performance of financial markets, including emerging markets, such as with regard to:





  
 -        The frequency and severity of defaults by issuers in our fixed income
investment portfolios; and





  
 -        The effects of corporate bankruptcies and/or accounting restatements on the
financial markets and the resulting decline in the value of equity and debt securities we hold;




   ¡
  
The frequency and severity of insured loss events;




   ¡
  
Changes affecting mortality, morbidity and other factors that may impact the profitability of our insurance products;




   ¡
  
Changes affecting interest rate levels and continuing low or rapidly changing interest rate levels;




   ¡
  
Changes affecting currency exchange rates, in particular the EUR/USD and EUR/GBP exchange rates;




   ¡
  
Increasing levels of competition in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and emerging markets;




   ¡
  
Changes in laws and regulations, particularly those affecting our operations, the products we sell, and the attractiveness of certain products to our consumers;




   ¡
  
Regulatory changes relating to the insurance industry in the jurisdictions in which we operate;

   ¡
  
Litigation or regulatory action that could require us to pay significant damages or change the way we do business;




   ¡

   ¡
  
Competitive, legal, regulatory, or tax changes that affect the distribution cost of or demand for our products;




   ¡

   ¡
  
The impact our adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards may have on our reported financial results and financial condition.
 Further details of potential risks and uncertainties affecting the company are described in the
company’s filings with Euronext Amsterdam and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 20-F. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this document. Except as required by any applicable
law or regulation, the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company’s expectations with regard
