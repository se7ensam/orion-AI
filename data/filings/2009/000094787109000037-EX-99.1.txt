        (Note)
Revision of earnings forecast for this period : None
        Advantest’s
business focuses on test systems for semiconductors, and relies heavily on the
capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, test houses and
foundries.  The capital expenditures of these companies are determined
primarily by factors such as current or future trends in the demand for
semiconductors.  In recent years, as a result of expansion in
application of semiconductors, in digital consumer products, mobile devices and
motor vehicles, it has become difficult to foresee trends in the demand for
semiconductors.  Furthermore, movements towards restructuring by and
between semiconductor manufacturers are accelerating as a result of the current
decline in demand for semiconductors due to the global economic slowdown, and
trends among semiconductor manufacturers and other corporations with respect to
capital expenditures have become increasingly uncertain. Because of the
great difficulty involved in forecasting earnings in such an operating
environment, the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 has
not been presented.  Advantest
intends to promptly disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure
becomes available.

          The
operating environment in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31,
2009 has shown signs of rapid economic downturn as a result of the trend towards
global economic slowdown due to the bankruptcy of major U.S. financial
institutions and other effects of the financial crisis worsening day by day, and
the simultaneous rise in the value of the yen, falling stock prices, and other
factors.  In the test systems for semiconductors market, semiconductor
manufacturers recorded reduced revenues as a result of the substantial decline
in the individual consumption of end consumer items such as digital consumer
products that utilize semiconductors, and have moved toward minimizing capital
expenditures through substantial production adjustments.  Moreover,
trend towards restructuring and mergers and acquisitions by and between
semiconductor manufacturers has accelerated, resulting in semiconductor
manufacturers adopting a cautious attitude toward investments due to the
prospect of a surplus of production facilities.  As a result, along
with other factors, Advantest’s already challenging business environment has
become more difficult.  Accordingly, the results with respect to
orders input received and net sales continued to be weak.  Orders
input received was (Y) 8.9 billion (a 71.7% decrease in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year) and net sales were (Y) 14.6
billion (a 58.3% decrease).  Furthermore, the percentage of net sales
to overseas customers was 55.4%, compared to 78.4% in the corresponding period
of the previous fiscal year.
          With
respect to income, measures to improve productivity were strongly emphasized
throughout Advantest to reduce fixed expenses, such as cutting costs and
minimizing capital expenditures.  However, despite these efforts, in
addition to a decline in income as a result of a significant decrease in net
sales, Advantest recorded inventory valuation losses in accordance with reduced
demand for the test systems for semiconductors.  Accordingly,
Advantest recorded an operating loss of (Y) 11.6 billion, and a loss before
income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated company of (Y) 13.1
billion.

          In the Semiconductor and Component Test System Segment,
semiconductor manufacturers conducted substantial production adjustments as a
result of a decline in revenue of semiconductor manufacturers due to the excess
supply of semiconductors and significant decline in semiconductor prices, and
many manufacturers either restrained their capital expenditures initiatives or
froze them entirely.  Demand for test systems for memory
semiconductors continued to be weak, as a result of significantly reduced demand for DRAM
semiconductors, which are used in computers and other products, and flash memory
semiconductors, which are used for saving data in mobile phones and audio
players, and the continued decline of semiconductor prices.  The
environment in the non memory semiconductor market continued to be difficult, as
a result of semiconductor manufacturers beginning to implement production
adjustments with respect to semiconductors installed in automobiles as a result
of weak automobile production, in addition to manufacturers of LCD driver ICs
continuing to restrain their capital expenditures.
          As a result of the
above, orders input received was (Y) 2.7 billion (a 87.3% decrease in comparison

        Semiconductor
manufacturers restrained their capital expenditures in almost all of the
segments during the third quarter. Accordingly, demand for test handlers and
device interface products, which connect to test systems, continued to be
weak.
        As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 1.7 billion (a 73.9% decrease
in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), net
sales were (Y) 2.3 billion (a 67.9% decrease) and operating loss was (Y) 1.5

          With
respect to the qualitative information
concerning the consolidated business results for the first quarter and
the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, please refer to “FY
2008 First Quarter Consolidated Financial Results” (disclosed on July 25, 2008)
and “FY 2008 Second Quarter Consolidated Financial Results” (disclosed on

            2.  Analysis
of Financial Condition
          
          
            Total
assets at December 31, 2008 amounted to (Y) 257.6 billion, a decrease of (Y)
24.5 billion compared to September 30, 2008, primarily due to decreases in cash
and cash equivalents, trade receivables and inventories. The amount of total
liabilities was (Y) 28.3 billion, a decrease of (Y) 5.9 billion compared to
September 30, 2008, primarily due to decreases in trade accounts payable and
accrued expenses.  Stockholders’ equity was (Y) 229.3 billion. Equity
to assets ratio was 89.0%, an increase of 1.1 percentage point from September
30, 2008.
          
           
          (Cash
Flow Condition)
          Cash and
cash equivalents held at December 31, 2008 were (Y) 118.2 billion, a decrease of
(Y) 32.5 billion from September 30, 2008. Significant cash flows during the
third quarter of this fiscal year and their causes are described
below.
          Net cash
used in operating activities was (Y) 7.2 billion. This amount was primarily
attributable to net loss of (Y) 7.8 billion.
          Net cash
used in investing activities was (Y) 16.3 billion. This amount was primarily
attributable to expenditures in short-term investments in the amount of (Y) 15.4
billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount of (Y) 0.8
billion.
          Net cash
used in financing activities was (Y) 4.2 billion. This amount was primarily
attributable to dividend payments in the amount of (Y)
4.2billion.

Corporation (FY2008 Q3)
             3.  Prospects
for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
          Since the
occurrence of the financial crisis, the economic trends have worsened beyond
what Advantest had contemplated and, going forward, Advantest anticipates
unexpected destabilizing events will continue in the short term.
          In this
difficult environment, Advantest will continue to focus on manufacturing that
emphasizes quality, cost and the timely introduction of products, without
neglecting the development of new products in preparation for economic recovery,
and on maintaining and expanding the market share, in addition to working
towards reducing fixed expenses and reinforcing Advantest’s financial position
by reviewing additional cost cuts in all aspects of its operations.
          Although
the earnings forecast for the year ending March 31, 2009 has not been disclosed,
as set forth on page 2 (summary information), Advantest intends to promptly
disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes
available.
          
          4.  Others
          (1)
Material changes in subsidiaries during this period (changes in scope of
consolidation resulting from changes in subsidiaries): None
          
          (2) Use
of simplified accounting method and special accounting policy for quarterly
consolidated financial statements:
          Tax
expense is measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Advantest
makes its best estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full
consolidated fiscal year and use that rate to provide for income
taxes  on a current year-to-date basis. The estimated effective tax
rate includes the deferred tax effects of expected year-end temporary
differences, and carryforwards must be projected.
          
          (3)  Changes
in accounting principles, procedures and the presentation of the quarterly
consolidated financial statements:
          Effective
from the current fiscal year, pursuant to Paragraph 93 of the “Regulations
concerning the Terminology, Forms and Methods of Preparation of Quarterly
Financial Statements”, the terminology, form and method of preparation of
Advantest’s quarterly consolidated financial statements are based on U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).
          
          In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,”
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
enhances fair value measurement disclosure.
          SFAS 157
does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances, but does require
additional disclosures in both annual and quarterly reports. Advantest adopted
SFAS 157 and its related amendments for financial assets and liabilities on
April 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a significant impact on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition. SFAS 157 will be
effective for non-financial assets and liabilities in financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
