    Operating Review  Fourth Quarter  Acergy Africa and Mediterranean
– As expected, revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was lower at $207.7 million (Q4 2007: $434.1 million) due to the planned dry-docks on the Acergy Polaris, Acergy Legend and Acergy Hawk during the quarter and some
operational rescheduling on projects. Good progress was made on EPC2B, Block 15 and Agbami during the quarter. As a result of the high level of dry-docking activity net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $22.8 million
(2007: $109.1 million) due to significantly lower activity levels of projects in offshore installation in the quarter.  Acergy Northern Europe and
Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $226.1 million (Q4 2007: $149.5 million) reflecting high levels of SURF, IMR and survey activity. Good progress was made on Marathon Volund, StatoilHydro Alve, Deep
Panuke and Tyrihans subsea installation. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $65.4 million (2007: $13.4 million) driven by strong project performance, including StatoilHydro Alve, Deep Panuke and Tyrihans subsea
installation and the recognition of a $33 million pension credit.  Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from
continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $1.8 million (Q4 2007: $1.1 million) with net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter of $3.9 million (Q4 2007: net operating loss of $1.3 million) due to the contribution from the
cross-regional project; Frade, which progressed on schedule.  Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for the
fourth quarter was $90.9 million (Q4 2007: $62.2 million) driven by strong revenue contribution from the Frade Project. The three ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras achieved full utilisation outside of planned dry-docks. Net
operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $7.4 million (Q4 2007: $2.9 million) due to good performance on the Frade project and the ships on long-term service agreement.  Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $45.0 million (2007: $42.2 million) reflecting good
progress on projects. Net operating income from continuing operations of $2.1 million (2007: net operating loss of $10.1 million) reflected good project performance, including successful project close-outs on Van Gogh and Liu Hua.  Full Year  Acergy Africa and Mediterranean
– As expected, revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was lower at $1,175.9 million (2007: $1,398.4 million) due to unusually high levels of planned dry-docks on Acergy Polaris, Acergy Legend and Acergy Hawk during the
second half of the year. Good progress was made on major projects, EPC2B, Tombua Landana, and Block 15 and the successful completion of the Kizomba C Projects, Mondo and Saxi Batuque. As a result of the high level of dry-docking activity net
operating income from continuing operations was $183.7 million (2007: $229.2 million) due to significantly lower activity levels of projects in offshore installation in the second half of the year.  Acergy Northern Europe and Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was $843.1 million (2007: $696.6 million) reflecting high
levels of SURF, IMR and survey activity and high vessel utilisation of an increased capacity due to fleet expansion. Net operating income from continuing operations was $192.0 million (2007: $121.5 million) driven by strong project performance,
including significant progress on Marathon Volund, Sage Hot Tap, Miskar and Tyrihans subsea installation and the recognition of a $33 million pension credit.  Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was $4.4 million (2007: $3.2 million) with net operating income from continuing operations of $10.5 million (2007:
net operating loss of $5.2 million) due to the contribution from the cross-regional projects; PRA-1, which completed during the year and Frade, which progressed on schedule.  Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was $320.1 million (2007: $202.0 million) driven by strong revenue contributions from SURF projects, PRA-1 and Frade.
The three ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras achieved full utilisation outside of planned dry-docks. Net operating income from continuing operations was $22.6 million (2007: net operating loss of $1.3 million) due to good performance
on SURF projects and the ships on long-term service agreement.

    Acergy Asia and Middle East –
Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was $180.8 million (2007: $102.4 million) following the completion of the Vincent, Maari and Liu Hua Projects and good progress on other projects, including Pluto. Net operating income from
continuing operations of $14.4 million (2007: net operating loss of $28.7 million) reflected good project performance and successful project close-outs. Sapura 3000 delivered a strong operational performance post delivery and completed the
first offshore phase of the Kikeh Project for SapuraAcergy, our joint venture.  Share of results of associates and joint ventures  The fourth quarter contribution from associates and joint ventures was $26.0 million (2007: $5.0 million) reflecting strong contributions from NKT Flexibles and Seaway
Heavy Lifting and a small positive contribution from the SapuraAcergy joint venture.  The full year contribution from associates and joint ventures was
$63.0 million (2007: $31.5 million) reflecting strong contributions from NKT Flexibles and Seaway Heavy Lifting, partly offset by a loss from the SapuraAcergy joint venture.  Discontinued operations  Net income from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter was $1.5 million (Q4 2007:
net loss of $36.5 million) due to the partial reversal of a previously recorded impairment charge on Acergy Piper more than offsetting the negative contribution from the Mexilhao Trunkline Project.  Net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2008 was $22.5 million (2007: net income of $5.7 million) due to the negative contribution from Mexilhao Trunkline
Project in Brazil, compared to positive contributions from the Eldfisk and Tyrihans Trunkline Projects in fiscal year 2007 and the partial reversal of a previously recorded impairment charge on Acergy Piper.  Asset Development  During the year, further rejuvenation dominated
our fleet management programme. Acergy Viking and Skandi Acergy joined the fleet in the first and third quarters respectively, while Acergy Petrel was acquired during the second quarter. Sapura 3000 was delivered to our joint
venture, SapuraAcergy during the third quarter.  Fiscal year 2008 was a year of an unusually high level of planned dry docks with nine vessels undertaking
dry docks, including Acergy Polaris which completed a major seven month dry dock, including an extensive upgrade and life enhancement programme and successfully recommenced operations post year end.  Financial Review  Fourth Quarter  Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $568 million (Q4 2007: $692 million) reflecting strong SURF and IMR activity levels in the North and
Norwegian Seas, higher SURF activity levels in Brazil and Asia Pacific, offset by lower activity levels in West Africa, due to planned dry-docks, particularly Acergy Polaris.  Gross profit was $145 million (Q4 2007: $187 million) reflecting good project execution during the quarter and the recognition of a $33 million pension credit, offset by the lower activity levels and fewer projects in
installation phase in Africa.  Administrative expenses were $68 million (Q4 2007: $67 million) reflecting increased costs offset by movements in the US
dollar.  Acergy’s share of results from associates and joint ventures increased significantly to $26 million (Q4 2007: $5 million), with good
contributions from NKT Flexibles and Seaway Heavy Lifting.  The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the three months was 23.8% (Q4 2007:
21.7%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 18.9% (Q4 2007: 16.6%).  Other gains were $35 million (Q4 2007: Other
losses $7 million) reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation primarily on short-term intercompany balances.

    Income before taxation from continuing operations
for the fourth quarter was $136 million (Q4 2007: $110 million), reflecting good project execution, a good contribution from associates and joint ventures and the recognition of a $33 million pension credit, somewhat offset by the lower activity
levels in Africa due to the planned dry dock programme.  Taxation for the quarter was $46 million (Q4: 2007: $102 million), reflecting an effective rate of
34%.  Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $90 million (Q4 2007: $7 million). Net income from total operations for the fourth
quarter was $91 million (Q4 2007: net operating loss from total operations $29 million).  Full Year  Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was $2,522 million (2007: $2,406 million) due to strong SURF and IMR activity levels in the North and Norwegian
Seas, significantly higher activity levels in Brazil and Asia Pacific, offset by lower activity levels in West Africa, driven by the planned dry-dock scheduling, particularly Acergy Polaris during the third and fourth quarters.  Gross profit was $648 million (2007: $547 million). Fiscal year 2008 saw an increase in the number of major projects in installation phase. The improvement in gross
margin reflected the continued improvement in the volume and quality of project execution during the year and the recognition of a $33 million pension credit in Acergy Northern Europe & Canada, offset by slightly lower utilisation due to
planned dry-docks.  Administrative expenses were $254 million (2007: $228 million) reflecting increased tendering levels, higher infrastructure costs in
Brazil and movements in the US dollar.  Acergy’s share of associates and joint ventures increased significantly to $63 million (2007: $32 million),
with strong contributions from NKT Flexibles and Seaway Heavy Lifting, offset by a loss on the SapuraAcergy joint venture.  The Adjusted EBITDA margin from
continuing operations for the twelve months was 22.7% (2007: 18.2%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the twelve months was 19.4% (2007: 16.7%).  Other gains were $44 million (2007: $1 million) reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation primarily on short-term intercompany balances.  Income before taxation from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was $492 million (2007: $344 million) reflecting good project execution, strong contribution from associates and joint ventures and the
recognition of a $33 million pension credit.  Taxation for the twelve months was $163 million (2007: $215 million), reflecting an effective rate of 33%.
 Net income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 was $330 million (2007: $129 million). Net income for total operations for fiscal year 2008 was
$307 million (2007: $135 million).  The cash and cash equivalents position at the year end was $573 million (2007: $583 million). Deferred revenue, at the
year end stood at $306 million (2007: $217 million).  At quarter end, Acergy S.A. held directly 11,258,758 treasury shares representing 5.78% of the total
number of issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares.  The Board
proposes to increase the dividend by 5% to $0.22 per share (2007: $0.21 per share), subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.

(2)
Pre-backlog reflects the stated value of letters of intent and the expected value of escalations on frame agreements  Outlook  The macro drivers for our business are global growth in
demand for energy and the needs of our clients to access reserves, often in more difficult environments. Recent global economic conditions have created a more challenging short-term market and reduced near-term visibility but the medium and
long-term fundamentals of our business remain robust. We therefore expect to see short-term volatility but we remain encouraged by the ongoing discussions with clients in West Africa and other parts of the world.  **********************************************************************************************************  Acergy S.A. is a seabed-to-surface engineering and construction contractor to the offshore oil and gas industry worldwide. We provide integrated services, and we plan,
design and deliver complex projects in harsh and challenging environments.  **********************************************************************************************************  (a) Adjusted EBITDA: The group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from
continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to
exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as endorsed for use in the European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as it
eliminates the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the
group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to
EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the
SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the group’s
operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the group’s liquidity. The reconciliation of the group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing
operations is included in this release. This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and
impairment charges on property, plant and equipment. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by
companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined
above. Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.  Forward-Looking Statements:
Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be
identified by the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,”
“should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to discussions with clients in West Africa and other parts of the world, expectations as to our future growth, statements
as to expectations regarding our backlog and pre backlog and statements contained in the “Outlook” section, including statements as to the macro drivers for our business continuing to drive the need to develop further reserves,
management’s confidence that delayed projects will be awarded and the medium and long-term fundamentals for our business remain robust.. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are subject to risks and
uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially
from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of
legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of laws and regulations;
and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

therefore included in the calculation.   


-
For the twelve months ended November 30, 2008 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible is to reduce the diluted EPS from $1.62 to $1.59. This is said to be dilutive and is
therefore included in the calculation.
