FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 
This document contains
forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management and
reflect our current expectations as contemplated under the safe harbor
provisions of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Such statements include, but are not limited to,
statements with respect to our objectives, goals and outlook including our
estimated product shipments, revenue and operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures), as well as statements with respect to our beliefs, plans,
objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions. Words such as
"estimate", "project", "believe", "anticipate", "intend", "expect", "plan",
"predict", "may", "should", "will", the negatives of these words or other
variations thereof and comparable terminology are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are difficult
to predict.
In particular, these
forward-looking statements are based on certain specific assumptions relating to
our expectations with respect to the generation of new sales, producing,
delivering and selling the expected product volumes at the expected prices, and
controlling our costs. They are also based on a variety of general factors and
assumptions including, but not limited to, our expectations regarding product
development efforts, manufacturing capacity, product pricing, market demand, and
the availability and prices of raw materials, labour and supplies. These
assumptions have been derived from information available to the Company
including information obtained by the Company from third parties. These
assumptions may prove to be incorrect in whole or in part. In addition, actual
results may differ materially from those expressed, implied, or forecasted in
such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from the results expressed, implied or forecasted
in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the
condition of the global economy; the rate of mass adoption of our products;
changes in product pricing; changes in our customers' requirements, the
competitive environment and related market conditions; product development
delays; changes in the availability or price of raw materials, labour and
supplies; our ability to attract and retain business partners, suppliers,
employees and customers; changing environmental regulations; our access to
funding and our ability to provide the capital required for product development,
operations and marketing efforts; our ability to protect our intellectual
property; the magnitude of the rate of change of the Canadian dollar versus the
U.S. dollar; and the general assumption that none of the risks identified in the
Risks and Uncertainties section of this report or in our most recent Annual
Information Form will materialize. Readers should not place undue reliance on
Ballard's forward-looking statements.


The forward-looking statements
contained in this document speak only as of the date of this Management
Discussion and Analysis. Except as required by applicable legislation, Ballard
does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this Management Discussion and Analysis, including the occurrence of
unanticipated events.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW

At Ballard, we are building a
clean energy growth company. We are recognized as a world leader in proton
exchange membrane (“PEM”) fuel cell development and commercialization. Our
principal business is the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of
fuel cell products for a variety of applications, focusing on motive power
(material handling and buses) and stationary power (back-up power and
residential cogeneration).
A fuel cell is an environmentally
clean electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen (from the
air) to produce electricity. The hydrogen fuel can be obtained from natural gas,
kerosene, methanol or other hydrocarbon fuels, or from water through
electrolysis. As long as fuel is supplied, the fuel cell produces electricity
efficiently and continuously without combustion, with water and heat as the main
byproducts when hydrogen is used as the fuel source.
Ballard® fuel cell products
feature high fuel efficiency, low operating temperature, low noise and
vibration, compact size, quick response to changes in electrical demand, modular
design and environmental cleanliness. 
Over the past three years, the
Company implemented a strategy to focus on key growth opportunities with
near-term commercial prospects. We sold our automotive fuel cell systems
operations to DaimlerChrysler AG (“Daimler”) and Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) on
August 31, 2005. We subsequently sold our electric drive operations to Siemens
VDO Automotive Corporation ("Siemens VDO") on February 15, 2007. Finally, we
completed our exit from the fuel cell car business by selling our automotive
fuel cell research and development assets to Daimler, Ford and a newly created
private corporation, AFCC Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. (“AFCC”). We
completed this transaction (the “AFCC Transaction”) on January 31, 2008, we
completed the AFCC Agreement and recorded a gain of $96.8 million. Under the
terms of the AFCC Transaction, we transferred to Daimler, Ford and AFCC our
automotive patents, automotive fuel cell test equipment, automotive fuel cell
inventory, $60 million in cash, all automotive fuel cell warranty liabilities
and automotive fuel cell development contracts between Ballard, Daimler and
Ford, 80.1% of the outstanding shares of AFCC, 112 personnel, and a royalty
free, sub-licensable license to the remaining Ballard intellectual property for
use in automotive applications. In exchange, Daimler and Ford returned to us an
aggregate of 34,261,298 of our common shares valued at $173.9 million, one Class
A share and one Class B share, collectively representing Daimler and Ford’s
entire direct and indirect equity interest in Ballard. These shares were then
cancelled. In accordance with GAAP, the operations of our automotive segment
disposed of in the AFCC Transaction have not been presented as discontinued
operations due to our continuing relationship with AFCC and the provision of
product and services subsequent to the sale of the automotive assets. As a
result, comparative figures have not been restated. See note 3 to our
consolidated financial statements. After the closing of the AFCC Transaction,
our automotive segment’s focus is on fuel cell buses and contract technical and
manufacturing services.


Following completion of these
dispositions, we identified a way to extract value from our tax attributes in
2008 through a restructuring transaction with Superior Plus Income Fund
("Superior Plus") resulting in a non-dilutive financing with net cash proceeds
of $33.8 million (Canadian $41.2 million). Pursuant to this corporate
reorganization, completed on December 31, 2008 under a Plan of Arrangement
(“Arrangement”), Superior Plus transferred $38.0 million (Canadian $46.3
million) to us. We subsequently transferred all of our assets and liabilities
(including the net cash proceeds from this Arrangement of $33.8 million, but
excluding our historic Canadian income tax carry forward attributes), to the
Company. Ballard shareholders exchanged their old shares, on a one-for-one
basis, for shares of the Company. The Company will now carry on the full scope
of our business of the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of
hydrogen fuel cells for a variety of applications and will hold all rights to
intellectual property as we held prior to the completion of the Arrangement. As
part of the Arrangement, Superior Plus’ unitholders obtained new shares of the
old Ballard entity. That entity will retain Ballard’s historic Canadian income
tax carry forward attributes.
As the transfer of the business
assets, liabilities and operations from old Ballard to the Company represented a
transaction with no change in shareholder ownership, the transaction was
accounted for using continuity of interest accounting. Pursuant to continuity of
interest accounting, the assets transferred and liabilities assumed were
recorded at their carrying values as reported by old Ballard immediately prior
to the completion of the Arrangement. As a result, the net cash proceeds of
$33.8 million (Canadian $41.2 million) were recorded as a credit to
shareholders’ equity. In addition, as the future income tax benefits of old
Ballard’s Canadian non-capital losses, capital losses, scientific research and
development expenditures and investment tax credits generated through to the
date of the completion of the Arrangement are not available to the Company after
the completion of the Arrangement, the gross future income tax assets related to
these Canadian tax pools was reduced to nil, with a corresponding reduction of
the related valuation allowance. Details of the Arrangement are described more
fully in our Management Information Circular dated November 14, 2008. See also
note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. 
We are based in Canada, with head
office, research and development, testing and manufacturing facilities in
Burnaby, British Columbia. In addition, we have sales, research and development
and manufacturing facilities in Lowell, Massachusetts. We also participate in a
joint venture, EBARA BALLARD Corporation (“EBARA BALLARD”), in Tokyo, Japan that
develops, manufactures and sells fuel cell stationary power products to
customers in Japan.


In 2008, we operated in three
market segments: 


  
    
    1.
    
    Power Generation:
      Fuel cell products and services for material handling, back-up power and
      residential cogeneration purposes;
  
          
     
  
    
    2.
    
    Automotive: Fuel
      cell products and services for fuel cell cars, vans and buses;
    and
  
    
     
  
    
    3.
          
    Material
      Products: Carbon fiber products primarily for automotive transmissions and
      gas diffusion layers (“GDL”) for fuel cells.

    Normalized net loss and operating cash consumption are non-GAAP
      measures. We use certain Non- GAAP measures to assist in assessing our
      financial performance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized
      meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to
      similar measures presented by other companies. See reconciliation to GAAP
      in Non-GAAP Measures section.
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW – Year ended
December 31, 2008 
In 2008, our revenues decreased 9%
to $59.6 million from $65.5 million in 2007, meeting our revised guidance range
of $58 to $64 million. However, adjusting for light-duty automotive engineering
development revenue in 2008 and 2007 which relates to the business sold to AFCC
of $1.6 million and $15.8 million, respectively, pro forma revenues increased
$8.2 million, or 17%, in 2008 compared to 2007.
We reduced operating cash
consumption in 2008 (see non-GAAP measures section) by 23% to $29.3 million,
down from $38.2 million in 2007, meeting our guidance range of $20-$30 million
despite the negative impact of foreign exchange losses on our Canadian monetary
assets in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Revenue 
While overall revenue for 2008
declined 9%, or $6.0 million, compared to 2007, product and service revenues
increased 22%, or $9.4 million, due to higher shipments of bus, material
handling, light duty automotive and back-up power fuel cell products and to new
testing and engineering services to AFCC which were only partially offset by
lower shipments of residential cogeneration and carbon fiber products.
Engineering development revenue declined $15.3 million primarily as a result of
the elimination of light-duty automotive fuel cell program work subsequent to
the closing of the AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008.


Net income (loss)

Our net income for 2008 increased
to $34.1 million, or $0.40 per share, compared with a net loss of $57.3 million,
or ($0.50) per share, in 2007. Net income for 2008 includes a gain on sale of
assets of $96.8 million resulting from the AFCC Transaction partially offset by
the write-down of a non-core investment in Chrysalix Energy Limited Partnership
(“Chrysalix”) of $3.0 million. Net loss for 2007 includes a write-down of our
non-core investment in Advanced Energy Inc. (“Advanced Energy”) of $4.6 million
and a loss from discontinued operations of $0.5 million. 
Normalized net loss

Our normalized net loss (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for 2008 increased to $60.0 million, or ($0.71) per share,
compared with a normalized net loss of $52.2 million, or ($0.46) per share, for
2007. The primary reasons for the $7.7 million higher normalized net loss in
2008 were due to decreases in foreign exchange gains of $12.4 million and
decreases in investment income of $6.2 million. Decreases in product and service
gross margins of $13.0 million and engineering development revenues of $15.3
million were more than offset by decreases in operating expenses of $29.3
million and depreciation and amortization of $9.7 million. Lower gross margins
were driven by larger reductions in warranty provisions in 2007 compared to
2008, combined with reduced field service activities for fuel cell buses and
more aggressive product pricing and enhanced warranty coverage on material
handling products in order to escalate market adoption. This was partially
offset by improved gross margin as a result of new testing and engineering
services provided to AFCC and increased fuel cell bus margins as a result of the
B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program. The decline in operating
expenses was driven by lower research and development expenses on automotive
fuel cell programs as a result of the AFCC Transaction. The increase in
normalized net loss on a per share basis was due primarily to the 30% reduction
in the number of common shares outstanding as a result of the AFCC Transaction.

Operating cash consumption

Operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for 2008 decreased 23% to $29.3 million, compared to $38.2
million for 2007. The $8.9 million improvement in operating cash consumption was
driven primarily by lower working capital requirements, lower operating expenses
and lower net capital expenditures, partially offset by lower foreign exchange
gains of $12.4 million, a decline in investment income of $6.2 million and lower
product and service gross margins and engineering development
revenues. 


FINANCIAL OVERVIEW – Quarter
ended December 31, 2008 
Revenue 
Our revenues for the fourth
quarter of 2008 decreased 6% to $18.9 million, compared to $20.1 million for the
same period of 2007. However, adjusting for light-duty automotive engineering
development revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 which relates to the business
sold to AFCC of $8.4 million, pro forma revenues increased $7.2 million, or 61%,
in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 2007. Product and service revenues
increased 76%, or $8.0 million, due to bus shipments for the B.C. Transit 2010
Olympic fuel cell bus program combined with higher shipments of material
handling, back-up power and carbon fiber products partially offset by lower
shipments of residential cogeneration products. Engineering development revenue
declined $9.2 million primarily as a result of the elimination of light-duty
automotive fuel cell program work subsequent to the closing of the AFCC
Transaction on January 31, 2008. 
Net income (loss)

Our net loss for the fourth
quarter of 2008 increased to $18.0 million, or ($0.22) per share, compared with
a net loss of $15.9 million, or ($0.14) per share, in the fourth quarter of
2007. The primary reasons for the $2.1 million higher net loss in the fourth
quarter of 2008 was due to increases in foreign exchange losses of $3.6 million
and decreases in investment income of $1.8 million. Decreases in product and
service gross margins of $2.4 million and engineering development revenues of
$9.2 million were more than offset by decreases in operating expenses of $14.1
million and depreciation and amortization of $3.0 million. Lower gross margins
were driven by larger reductions in warranty provisions in the fourth quarter of
2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and more aggressive product pricing
and enhanced warranty coverage on material handling products in order to
encourage market adoption, partially offset by improved gross margin as a result
of new testing and engineering services provided to AFCC and increased fuel cell
bus margins as a result of the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program.
The decline in operating expenses was driven by lower research and development
expenses on automotive fuel cell programs as a result of the AFCC Transaction.
The increase in net loss per share was primarily due to the 30% reduction in the
number of common shares outstanding as a result of the AFCC Transaction. Net
loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 also includes a $3.0 million write-down of a
non-core investment in Chrysalix and the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2007
includes a $4.6 million write-down of a non-core investment in Advanced
Energy. 
Operating cash consumption

Operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 31% to $8.5 million,
compared to $12.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The $3.8 million
improvement in operating cash consumption was driven primarily by lower working
capital requirements, lower operating expenses and lower net capital
expenditures, partially offset by increased foreign exchange losses, a decline
in investment income and lower product and service gross margins and engineering
development revenues. 


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP, which require us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our
consolidated financial statements. We have identified the policies below as
critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of
operations. The application of these and other accounting policies are described
in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Our preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that
actual results will not differ from those estimates. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
We earn revenues under certain
contracts to provide engineering development services. These contracts provide
for the payment for services based on our achieving defined milestones or on the
performance of work under our product development programs. Revenues are
recognized under these contracts based on assessments of progress achieved
against these milestones or on the proportionate performance method of
accounting. There is a risk that a customer may ultimately disagree with our
assessment of the progress achieved against milestones or that our estimates of
the percentage of work completed could change. Should this occur, the revenues
recognized in the period might require adjustment in a subsequent
period.
Under the terms of certain other
contracts under which we earn product and engineering service revenue, revenue
is recognized based on the proportion of performance completed. There is a risk
that estimated costs to complete a contract might change, which may result in an
adjustment to previously recognized revenues. 

During the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007, there were no material adjustments to engineering development
revenue and product and service revenue relating to revenue recognized in a
prior period.
WARRANTY PROVISION 
A provision for warranty costs is
recorded on product sales at the time of shipment. In establishing the accrued
warranty liabilities, we estimate the likelihood that products sold will
experience warranty claims and the cost to resolve claims received. In making
such determinations, we use estimates based on the nature of the contract and
past and projected experience with the products. Should these estimates prove to
be incorrect, we may incur costs different from those provided for in our
warranty provisions. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 we
recorded provisions to accrued warranty liabilities of $4.4 million and $0.8
million, respectively, for new product sales.


We review our warranty assumptions
and make adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities quarterly based on the
latest information available and to reflect the expiry of contractual
obligations. Adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities are recorded in cost of
product and service revenues. As a result of these reviews, we recorded
adjustments that reduced accrued warranty liabilities by $0.4 million and $8.9
million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The 2008
adjustments to reduce accrued warranty liabilities were primarily due to
contractual expirations and improved lifetimes of our Power Generation fuel
cells. The 2007 adjustments to reduce accrued warranty liabilities were
primarily due to cost reductions, contractual expirations and improved lifetimes
of our Automotive fuel cells.
INVENTORY PROVISION 
In determining the lower of cost
and net realizable value of our inventory and establishing the appropriate
provision for inventory obsolescence, we estimate the likelihood that inventory
carrying values will be affected by changes in market pricing or demand for our
products and by changes in technology or design which could make inventory on
hand obsolete or recoverable at less than cost. We perform regular reviews to
assess the impact of changes in technology and design, sales trends and other
changes on the carrying value of inventory. Where we determine that such changes
have occurred and will have a negative impact on the value of inventory on hand,
appropriate provisions are made. If there is a subsequent increase in the value
of inventory on hand, reversals of previous write-downs to net realizable value
are made. Unforeseen changes in these factors could result in additional
inventory provisions, or reversals of previous provisions, being required.
During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, inventory provisions of
$0.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, were recorded as a charge to cost
of product and service revenues.
INVESTMENTS 
We have made strategic investments
in other companies or partnerships that are developing technology with potential
fuel cell applications. Each of these investments is either accounted for by the
equity method or carried at cost, depending on whether or not we have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the company or partnership. We
regularly review such investments and should circumstances indicate that an
impairment of value has occurred that is other than temporary, we would record
this impairment in the earnings of the current period. Given that these entities
are in the development stage, there is significant judgment required in
determining whether an impairment has occurred in the value of these investments
that must be recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a
$3.0 million write-down of our non-core investment in Chrysalix. During the year
ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $4.6 million write-down of our non-core
investment in Advanced Energy to $0.5 million, representing proceeds received of
$0.5 million.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND
GOODWILL
In accordance with Canadian GAAP,
we do not amortize goodwill, and we amortize intangible assets over periods
ranging from five to 15 years. At least annually, we review the carrying value
of our intangible assets and goodwill by segment for potential impairment. Among
other things, this review considers the fair value of the business based on
discounted estimated cash flows. If circumstances indicate that impairment in
the value of these assets has occurred, we would record this impairment in the
earnings of the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2008, no
write-downs of intangible assets or goodwill were recorded. During the year
ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $1.4 million charge to amortization
expense for patents no longer in use.


NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
AND DEVELOPMENTS
Convergence with International
Financial Reporting Standards 
In February 2008, Canada’s
Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) confirmed that Canadian GAAP, as used by
public companies, will be converged with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) effective January 1, 2011. The transition from Canadian GAAP
to IFRS will be applicable for us for the first quarter of 2011 when we will
prepare both the current and comparative financial information using
IFRS.
While IFRS uses a conceptual
framework similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant differences on
recognition, measurement and disclosures. We commenced our IFRS conversion
project in the second quarter of 2008. The project consists of four phases:
awareness raising; assessment; design; and implementation. With the assistance
of an external expert advisor, we have completed the awareness-raising phase and
have begun a high level review of the major differences between Canadian GAAP
and IFRS (the assessment phase). It is expected that this work will be completed
during 2009. Subsequently, we will initiate the design phase, which will involve
establishing issue-specific work teams to focus on generating options and making
recommendations in identified areas. We will also establish a communications
plan, begin to develop staff training programs, and evaluate the impacts of the
IFRS transition on other business activities. 
Capital Disclosures

In 2008, we adopted the
recommendations of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) for
capital disclosures (CICA Handbook Section 1535). This new section establishes
standards for disclosing information about an entity’s capital and how it is
managed. This standard requires us to disclose (i) our objectives, policies and
processes for managing capital; (ii) summary quantitative data about what we
manage as capital; (iii) whether during the period we complied with any
externally imposed capital requirements to which we are subject; and (iv) if we
have not complied with such requirements, the consequences of such
non-compliance. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In 2008, we elected to early adopt
the new recommendations of the CICA for accounting for “Goodwill and Intangible
Assets” (CICA Handbook Section 3064). This new section will replace the existing
standards for “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (CICA Handbook Section
3062) and “Research and Development Costs” (CICA Handbook Section 3450). The new
standard (i) states that upon their initial identification, intangible assets
are to be recognized as assets only if they meet the definition of an intangible
asset and the recognition criteria; (ii) provides guidance on the recognition of
internally generated intangible assets including research and development costs;
and (iii) carries forward the current requirements of Section 3062 for
subsequent measurement and disclosure of intangible assets and goodwill. As we
have historically expensed all research and development costs as incurred, we
were not materially impacted by the implementation of this new standard for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

year ended December 31, 2008 were $59.6 million, a $6.0 million, or 9% decrease
from 2008. Increases in product and service revenue of $9.4 million, or 22%,
were offset by declines in engineering development revenue of $15.3 million, or
69%, primarily as a result of the AFCC Transaction.

Power Generation product and
service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined $0.5 million, or
3%, compared to 2007. Increased product shipments and a change in sales mix
towards higher power units in the material handling market combined with higher
shipments in the back-up power market were offset by lower residential
cogeneration market sales and lower non-recurring engineering service revenues
for government contracts in the material handling market. The decline in
residential cogeneration market sales was expected due to the introduction in
2008 of a new lower cost product combined with the delivery of fuel cell MEAs
instead of fuel cell stacks as the fuel cell stacks will be assembled in Japan
by our joint venture, EBARA BALLARD.
Power Generation engineering
development revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced $2.4
million, or 37%, compared to 2007. Revenues are derived from our 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell program and reflect the percentage of completed
performance of our development program for our customer, the related costs of
which were included in research and development expenses. As expected, the
decline is due to the completion at the end of the third quarter of 2008 of our
current agreement with EBARA and EBARA BALLARD for the development of our 1kW
residential cogeneration fuel cell stack. Since 2005, we have recorded $18.0
million of engineering development revenue from EBARA BALLARD, representing the
full amount earned for the performance of work under this development
program.
Automotive product and service
revenues increased $11.2 million, or 69%, for the year ended December 31, 2008,
compared to 2007. Increased automotive service revenues derived from new testing
and engineering services provided to AFCC combined with the commencement of
shipments of fuel cell bus modules related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel
cell bus program (which contributed $6.0 million to revenue in December 2008)
and increased light duty automotive product shipments at lower prices to AFCC
were partially offset by the expected decline in field service revenues for fuel
cell buses due to a lower number of fuel cell buses under service
contracts.
Automotive engineering development
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $13.0 million, or 82%,
compared to 2007. The decline in 2008 is due primarily to the closing of the
AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008 resulting in only one month of automotive
development revenues in 2008 compared to a year of revenue in 2007. This
decrease was only partially offset by engineering development revenue related to
the test bus phase of the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program. The
costs associated with these engineering development revenues are included in
research and development expenses.


Material Products revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.4 million, or 10%, compared to 2007,
due primarily to decreased customer volumes as a result of the impact of a three
month labor strike affecting a key customer prior to its resolution in May 2008
combined with lower automotive sales due to the current unprecedented slow down
in the U.S. automotive industry.
Power Generation product and
service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $5.7 million, or
78%, compared to 2006. Higher non-recurring engineering service revenues for
government contracts in the material handling and back-up power markets
primarily drove the increase in the year. Increased unit sales of cogeneration,
material handling and back-up power fuel cell products, partially offset by
lower pricing, also contributed to the increase. Power Generation engineering
development revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $0.4
million, or 7%, compared to 2006, and were derived from our 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell program.
Automotive product and service
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $1.5 million, or 9%,
compared to 2006. Increased automotive fuel cell product shipments were offset
by a decline in automotive service revenues due to a lower number of fuel cell
buses under service contracts. The decline in field service revenues for fuel
cell buses was expected as the field trials were winding down. Automotive
service revenues were primarily earned from field service activities supporting
fuel cell buses in Europe, Australia and China.
Automotive engineering development
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $8.5 million, or 116%,
compared to 2006. The increase in automotive engineering development revenue
reflects the planned timing of performance of work and timing of achievement of
development milestones under our automotive fuel cell development program for
our customers, the related costs of which are included in research and
development expenses.
Material Products revenues for
year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.6 million, or 23%, compared to 2006,
due primarily to increased customer volumes.
Cost of product and service
revenues for the year ended December
31, 2008 were $47.4 million, an increase of $22.3 million, or 89%, compared to
2007. The $22.3 million increase for the year was driven by lower reversals of
accrued warranty liabilities in 2008 as compared to 2007, increased product
shipments in the bus, material handling, back-up power and automotive markets,
enhanced warranty terms and a change in sales mix towards higher power units in
the material handling market and costs incurred for new automotive testing and
engineering services provided to AFCC. These increases were partially offset by
lower residential cogeneration product costs due to the delivery of fuel cell
MEAs instead of fuel cell stacks and reduced service costs related to fewer fuel
cell buses under service contracts. As mentioned above, cost of product sales
was lower in 2007 compared to 2008 due in part to the reversal of accrued
warranty liabilities of $8.9 million in 2007, compared to $0.4 million in 2008.
The 2007 reductions in accrued warranty liabilities were primarily due to cost
reductions, contractual expirations and improved lifetime for our Automotive
fuel cells whereas the 2008 reductions were primarily due to contractual
expirations and improved lifetimes of our Power Generation fuel
cells.


Gross margins on product and
service revenues declined in 2008 to $5.3 million, compared to $18.3 million for
2007. This year over year decrease of $13.0 million was driven by larger
reductions in warranty provisions for 2007 compared to 2008, more aggressive
product pricing and enhanced warranty coverage on material handling products in
order to encourage market adoption, declines in field service revenues for fuel
cell buses, declines in service revenue and higher program expenditures on Power
Generation non-recurring engineering government contracts, and lower volumes of
carbon fiber products due to the effects of a labor strike affecting a key
customer (resolved in the second quarter of 2008) and the slow down in the U.S.
automotive industry. These declines were only partially offset by increased
margins as a result of new testing and engineering services provided to AFCC and
the commencement of shipments of fuel cell bus modules related to the B.C.
Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus project.
Cost of product and service
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $25.1 million, an increase of
$3.8 million, or 18%, compared to 2006. The $3.8 million increase for 2007 was
driven by higher automotive and cogeneration product shipments and costs
incurred for new government contracts in the material handling market partially
offset by lower costs related to automotive service revenues due to a lower
number of fuel cell buses under service contracts. Cost of product and service
revenue was also affected by the reduction of warranty provisions of $8.9
million in 2007 compared to $5.8 million in 2006. The reductions in accrued
warranty liabilities were primarily due to cost reductions, contractual
expirations and improved lifetime for our automotive fuel cells. Gross margins
on product and service revenues improved in 2007 to $18.3 million, compared to
$15.3 million in 2006. This increase was driven by the reductions in warranty
provisions mentioned above combined with increased volumes in our carbon fiber
products, partially offset by lower gross margins in our Power Generation
segment as increased volumes were offset by lower sales prices, and lower gross
margins in our Automotive segment as declines in field service for buses offset
increased margins on automotive fuel cell products.
Research and product
development expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were $37.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million, or 36%,
compared to 2007. This decline in expenditures is due primarily to the
disposition of our automotive fuel cell development programs on the closing of
the AFCC Transaction, partially offset by increased investment in our Power
Generation and fuel cell bus programs and the negative effects of a stronger
Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar. Lower operating expenses in the
fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of a weakening Canadian dollar only partially
offset the negative impacts of a stronger Canadian dollar in the first three
quarters of 2008, compared to the corresponding periods of 2007.
Included in research and product
development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, were costs of $5.9
million related to our achievement of predefined milestones for our customers
under the development programs for which we earned engineering development
revenue. These same costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $25.3
million.  


Research and product development
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $58.5 million, an increase of
$6.2 million, or 12%, compared to 2006. The increase in expenditures in 2007
related primarily to the negative effect of a stronger Canadian dollar, relative
to the U.S. dollar, combined with increased investment in our Power Generation
and fuel cell bus programs. Included in research and product development
expenses for 2007 were costs of $25.3 million, compared to $22.9 million in
2006, related to our achievement of predefined milestones for our customers
under the development programs for which we earned engineering development
revenue.
General and
administrative expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were $12.6 million, a decrease of $6.5 million, or 34%,
compared to 2007. The decrease in 2008 is due to lower labour costs and training
and insurance expenditures combined with the 2007 impact of severance and
related costs of approximately $4.1 million incurred in conjunction with the
AFCC Transaction. Income earned in 2008 from administrative service agreements
with AFCC of $1.5 million is recorded as other income.
General and administrative
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $19.1 million, an increase of
$5.8 million, or 44%, compared to 2006. The overall increase is due primarily to
severance and related costs of approximately $4.1 million incurred in
conjunction with the AFCC Transaction, the negative effects of a stronger
Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, and a one-time commodity tax
refund received in 2006.
Marketing and business
development expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were $7.5 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 17%,
compared to 2007. The decrease is primarily due to decreased marketing
development support for our light duty automotive market.
Marketing and business development
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $9.0 million, an increase of
$1.8 million, or 24%, compared to 2006. The overall increase is primarily due to
increased marketing development support for our Power Generation markets
combined with the negative effects of a stronger Canadian dollar, relative to
the U.S. dollar.
Depreciation and
amortization was $6.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $9.7 million, or 62%, compared
to 2007. Depreciation and amortization has declined in 2008 as several assets
became fully depreciated or amortized during 2007 and certain intangible assets
were disposed of in the AFCC Transaction.
Depreciation and amortization was
$15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $0.7 million,
or 4%, compared to 2006. Certain intangible assets became fully amortized at the
end of 2006, resulting in the decline in depreciation and amortization. We also
stopped recording depreciation and amortization expense in November 2007 on the
long-lived assets included in the AFCC Transaction and reclassified them to
assets held for sale due to our decision to dispose of the assets at that time.
This overall decline in depreciation and amortization expense for 2007 was
partially offset by a $1.4 million charge to amortization expense for patents
that were no longer in use.
Investment and other income
(loss) was negative $0.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, compared to income of $16.9 million for 2007.

Investment income was $2.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 75%,
compared to 2007. The decrease was a result of lower average cash balances in
2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to the $60 million cash transfer in the AFCC
Transaction, combined with declining interest rates in the last half of 2007 and
into 2008. We classify our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as
held-for-trading and measure these assets at fair value with changes in fair
value recognized in income. The fair values are determined directly by reference
to quoted market prices. During 2008, the investment market was negatively
impacted by liquidity and credit market concerns along with increased concerns
about a global economic slowdown. We continue to review our exposure to these
issues and have determined that there are no material impacts on our investment
portfolio. In addition, we do not hold any asset-backed commercial paper that
was issued by a non-bank trust.
Foreign exchange gains and losses
are attributable to the effect of the changes in the value of the Canadian
dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, on our Canadian dollar-denominated net
monetary assets and on outstanding foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell
Canadian dollars over the respective periods. The foreign exchange loss of $3.7
million for 2008 resulted from the weakening of the Canadian dollar in 2008.
Compared to the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar has weakened in 2008 from 0.99
at December 31, 2007 to 1.22 at December 31, 2008. In addition to foreign
exchange contracts, we hold Canadian dollar cash and short-term investments to
reduce the foreign currency risk inherent in expenditures denominated in
Canadian dollars. Our foreign denominated cash and short-term investments do not
qualify for hedge accounting and therefore foreign exchange gains and losses are
recognized when they occur.
See note 19 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information about the significance of
financial instruments to our financial position and performance, the nature and
extent of risks arising from those financial instruments to which we are
exposed, and how we manage those risks.
Other income was $1.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008 and relates to administrative services
contracts with AFCC under which we provide accounting, supply chain, human
resources, information technology, facilities and other administrative
support.
Investment and other income for
the year ended December 31, 2007 was $16.9 million, an increase of $7.0 million,
or 70%, compared to 2006. The increase is due to foreign exchange gains in 2007
of $8.7 million partially offset by lower investment income of $1.7 million.
Foreign exchange gains in 2007 were a result of movements in the Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar on our net monetary assets and liabilities. Compared
to the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar strengthened from 1.17 at December 31,
2006 to 0.99 at December 31, 2007. Investment income declined in 2007 due to
lower average cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006 combined with declining
interest rates in the last half of 2007.


Loss on disposal and
write-down of long-lived assets were
$2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $4.6 million and
$0.8 million for the corresponding periods in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
expense in 2008 is primarily a result of a $3.0 million write-down in our
investment in Chrysalix to $0.5 million, representing estimated net realizable
value. The expense in 2007 is a result of a $4.6 million write-down in our
investment in Advanced Energy to $0.5 million, representing proceeds on sale
received in the fourth quarter of 2007. The expense in 2006 is primarily a
result of a loss on disposal of our investment in QuestAir of $0.6
million.
Gain on assets held for
sale was $96.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
reflecting the disposition of automotive assets pursuant to the AFCC
Transaction.
Equity in loss of associated
companies was $8.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $7.4 million and $7.0 million in 2007
and 2006, respectively, and relate to our share of the losses of EBARA BALLARD.
The increase in equity losses in 2008 is due to the negative effects of a
stronger Yen, relative to the U.S. dollar, combined with EBARA BALLARD’s
introduction of its next generation system product in Japan and increased
residential cogeneration market development activities.
CASH FLOWS, LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES
CASH FLOWS
Cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments were $85.4 million as at December 31, 2008, compared to
$145.6 million at the end of 2007. The decrease of $60.2 million in 2008 was
driven by the transfer of $60 million to Daimler, Ford and AFCC as part of the
AFCC Transaction combined with a net loss (excluding non-cash items) of $35.1
million, net investment in EBARA BALLARD of $5.9 million and net capital
expenditures of $3.1 million partially offset by working capital cash inflows of
$8.9 million and proceeds from the non-dilutive financing Arrangement with
Superior of $36.9 million.
For the year ended December 31,
2008, working capital requirements resulted in cash inflows of $8.9 million
compared to cash outflows of $13.8 million for 2007. In 2008, working capital
cash inflows were driven by lower inventory of $4.5 million due to higher fourth
quarter Power Generation shipments and fuel cell bus product shipments combined
with improved inventory management and increased platinum recoveries, higher
accrued warranty liabilities of $3.1 million as a result of the above noted
fourth quarter product shipments, and higher deferred revenue of $0.8 million
due to the timing of payments on pre-funded contracts.
For the year ended December 31,
2007, working capital requirements resulted in cash outflows of $13.8 million
compared to $12.3 million for 2006. In 2007, cash outflows were impacted by
higher accounts receivable of $4.1 million due to higher fourth quarter
engineering development revenue compared to the prior year and the timing of
collections of our product and engineering development revenues, combined with
increased working capital requirements of $4.6 million related to assets and
liabilities held for sale. The $4.6 million cash outflow from current assets and
current liabilities held for sale primarily represent lower accrued warranty
liabilities to service our automotive fuel cells, along with warranty
adjustments for expirations, lower projected costs and improved lifetimes. Cash
outflows from accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.7 million were
primarily due to the timing of payments combined with lower accrued liabilities
as a result of settlement in the year of previously disputed amounts, partially
offset by increased employee bonus accruals.


Investing activities resulted in
cash outflows of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
cash inflows of $19.8 million in 2007. Changes in short-term investments
resulted in cash inflows of $64.9 million in 2008 as compared to inflows of
$29.4 million in 2007 as balances changed between cash equivalents and
short-term investments as we made investment decisions with regards to the term
of investments in response to changes in yield curves in order to improve our
investment returns and in response to the $60 million funding requirement to
close the AFCC Transaction in the first quarter of 2008. Net capital spending of
$3.1 million in 2008 was primarily for manufacturing equipment, compared to net
capital spending in 2007 of $6.4 million primarily for manufacturing, test and
computer equipment. The cash flows used for other investing activities in 2008
of $6.2 million represent a net investment in EBARA BALLARD of $5.9 million,
comprising of an additional investment of $11.2 million offset by licensing cash
receipts of $5.3 million, combined with an investment in Chrysalix of $0.3
million. The cash flows used for other investing activities of $3.3 million in
2007 represent a net investment in EBARA BALLARD comprising of an additional
investment of $8.4 million offset by licensing cash receipts of $5.3 million,
combined with an investment in Chrysalix of $0.2 million. During 2007, we also
disposed of net assets of $1.8 million related to the finalization of the sale
of our electric drive business.
Investing activities resulted in
cash outflows of $50.8 million during 2006. Changes in short-term investments
resulted in cash outflows of $41.6 million as balances changed between cash
equivalents and short-term investments. Net capital spending in 2006 of $8.7
million was primarily for manufacturing, test stands and computer equipment.
During 2006, we sold our investment in QuestAir for proceeds of $3.3 million and
recorded net cash outflows of $3.3 million related to an additional investment
in EBARA BALLARD offset by licensing cash receipts from EBARA BALLARD. We also
made an additional investment of $0.8 million in Chrysalix.
Financing activities resulted in
cash inflows of $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
nil and $5.9 million, respectively, for 2007 and 2006. Financing activities in
2008 represent gross proceeds received on the closing of the Arrangement with
Superior of $38.0 million (Cdn. $46.3 million) less closing costs paid in 2008
of $1.1 million (Cdn. $1.3 million). We have accrued the remaining estimated
closing costs of $3.1 million (Cdn. $3.8 million) at December 31, 2008.
Financing activities for 2006 relate to equity funding received from
EBARA.
As at March 2, 2009, we had
82,122,135 common shares issued and outstanding and stock options to purchase
5,224,439 of our common shares outstanding.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES
As at December 31, 2008, we had
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $85.4 million. We
will use our funds to meet net funding requirements for the development and
commercialization of products in our target markets. This includes research and
product development for fuel cells and carbon fiber products, the purchase of
equipment for our manufacturing and testing facilities, the further development
of business systems and low-cost manufacturing processes and the further
development of our marketing, product distribution and service
capabilities.


At this stage of our development,
we expect to record losses for at least the next few years as we continue to
make significant investments in research, and product and market development
activities necessary to commercialize our products. Our actual funding
requirements will vary based on the factors noted above, our relationships with
our lead customers and strategic partners, our success in developing new
channels to market and relationships with customers, our success in generating
revenue growth from near-term product opportunities, our working capital
requirements, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the progress and results of our
research, development and demonstration programs.
Our financial strategy is to
manage our cash resources with strong fiscal discipline, focus on markets with
high product and service revenue growth potential, license technology in cases
where it is advantageous to us, and access available government funding for
research and development projects. Our current financing principle is to
maintain cash balances sufficient to fund at least six quarters of operating
cash consumption at all times. We believe that our current cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, combined with our ability to potentially
monetize other assets, including our interest in AFCC through the share purchase
agreement with Ford, are sufficient to meet our planned growth and development
activities for the foreseeable future without the need to access public market
financing. However, circumstances could change which would make it advantageous
for us to access additional capital.
OUTLOOK
Over the past three years, we have
re-vectored the Company to establish a sharp focus on key growth opportunities
with near-term commercial prospects in our core fuel cell markets. As a result,
for 2009 we will report our results in the following market segments:
1. Fuel Cell Products and Servicing (core segment):
fuel cell products and services for motive power (material handling and bus
markets) and stationary power (back-up power and residential cogeneration
markets);
2. Contract Automotive (supporting segment): contract technical and manufacturing services primarily for AFCC,
Daimler and Ford.
3. Material Products (supporting segment): material
products primarily for automotive transmissions and gas diffusion layers
(“GDL”).
We expect overall revenues for
2009 to be between $68 million to $78 million, compared to $59.6 million in
2008.
Fuel Cell Products revenue is
expected to increase in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to volume
increases in our back-up power, bus and material handling markets as a result of
our announced ACME (subject to product acceptance test in the fourth quarter of
2009), Dantherm, B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program, Transport of
London fuel cell bus program and Plug Power Central Grocer agreements. This
increase in Fuel Cell Products revenue is expected to be partially offset by
declines in Fuel Cell Products service revenues due to the completion of our
existing engineering service government contracts in the material handling and
back-up power markets, and declines in Fuel Cell Products engineering
development revenues due to the completion of our 1kW residential cogeneration
fuel cell development program in 2008. Residential cogeneration product revenues
in 2009 are expected to be similar to 2008 as the program is still in the
development stage of the Japanese government trial program.


Fuel Cell Product shipments are
expected to increase to 4,000 units in 2009, as compared to 1,855 units in 2008.
Materials handling shipments are expected to increase to 1,000 units, from 508
units; back-up power shipments to 2,500 units, from 720 units; and residential
cogeneration shipments to 500 units, from 403 units, respectively.
Supporting business revenues are
expected to decline in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower
technical services and lower contract manufacturing for AFCC, Daimler and Ford.
Material Products revenues in 2009 are expected to be similar to 2008 due to the
continued slow down in the U.S. automotive industry, partially offset by growth
in fuel cell GDL material sales.
We expect our operating cash
consumption (see Non-GAAP Measures) for 2009 to be between $17 million to $27
million, compared to $29.3 million in 2008 assuming no material fluctuations in
U.S. / Canadian dollar exchange rates. A primary driver for this expected
reduction in operating cash consumption for 2009 is expected increases in gross
margins as a result of increased product sales, combined with additional
reductions in operating expenses, to more than offset our increased investment
in production capacity. As a result of the timing of capital expenditures,
working capital impacts related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic and Transport
of London fuel cell bus programs, and the payment of 2008 employee bonuses in
the first half of 2009, operating cash consumption is expected to be higher in
the first half of 2009, as compared to the second half of the year.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
& CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
We maintain a 19.9% interest in
AFCC which is subject to a share purchase agreement under which Ford, either at
our option or Ford’s election, may purchase our interest in AFCC at any time on
or after January 31, 2013 for $65 million plus interest accruing at LIBOR from
January 31, 2008. The purchase may take place earlier than January 31, 2013 if
certain other events occur. Under Canadian GAAP, this share purchase agreement
is considered a derivative instrument and is therefore measured and recorded at
its fair value on the closing of the AFCC Transaction. We have recorded this
derivative at its fair value of $1 representing the difference between the
discounted present value of the share purchase agreement on closing and the
value of the underlying transferred AFCC assets. This derivative instrument is
carried at cost and is not marked to market each reporting period as we do not
believe it is possible to regularly determine its reliable fair value. If the
share purchase agreement were to be held to maturity and exercised on January
31, 2013, we anticipate that we would receive proceeds of approximately $68
million (based on current interest rates) and record an estimated gain of
approximately $67 million on the sale of our remaining 19.9% interest in AFCC.
If we were to monetize this share purchase agreement prior to its maturity date
of January 31, 2013, the amount of proceeds received would be subject to a
number of variables including Ford’s cost of borrowing, expected future LIBOR
rates, time remaining to January 31, 2013 and general market and other
conditions. Under present economic conditions, we believe that these factors
would result in a significant discount to the face value of the share purchase
agreement.


Periodically, we use foreign
exchange contracts to manage our exposure to currency rate fluctuations and
platinum forward purchase contracts to manage our exposure to platinum price
fluctuations. We record these contracts at their fair value as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our
consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding
forward exchange contracts to sell a total of Canadian $8 million at an average
rate of $1.12 Canadian per $1.00 United States dollar, resulting in an
unrealized loss of $0.6 million. In addition, we had outstanding platinum
forward purchase contracts to purchase a total of $2.4 million of platinum at an
average rate of $890 per troy ounce, resulting in an unrealized gain of $0.2
million.
As at December 31, 2008, we did
not have any other material obligations under guarantee contracts, retained or
contingent interests in transferred assets, outstanding derivative instruments
or non-consolidated variable interests.
We have agreed to pay total
royalties up to a maximum of $40.3 million (Cdn. $49.0 million) in respect of
future sales of fuel cell-based stationary power products under two development
programs with certain Canadian governmental agencies. To December 31, 2008, we
have made total royalty payments of $4.3 million (Cdn. $5.2 million) against
this potential obligation including royalty payments of $0.2 million (Cdn. $0.2
million) in 2008 and $0.1 million (Cdn. $0.2 million) in 2007. The conditions
under which these royalties become payable are described in more detail in note
14 to the consolidated financial statements.
We have committed to make future
capital contributions of $0.4 million (Cdn. $0.5 million) in Chrysalix, in which
we have a limited partnership interest.
As at December 31, 2008 we had the
following contractual obligations and commercial commitments:

In addition to the contractual
purchase obligations above, we have commitments to purchase $0.2 million of
capital assets as at December 31, 2008. Capital expenditures pertain to our
regular operations and will be funded through operating cash flows and cash on
hand. 


The Arrangement with Superior Plus
includes an indemnification agreement dated December 31, 2008 (the "Indemnity
Agreement"), which sets out the parties’ continuing obligations to the other.
The Indemnity Agreement has two basic elements: it provides for the
indemnification by each of the parties to the other for breaches of
representations and warranties or covenants as well as, in our case, any
liability relating to our business which is suffered by Superior Plus. Our
indemnity to Superior Plus with respect to our representation relating to the
existence of our tax pools immediately prior to the completion of the
Arrangement is limited to an aggregate of $6.1 million (Canadian $7.4 million)
with a threshold amount of $0.4 million (Canadian $0.5 million) before there is
an obligation to make a payment. Second, the Indemnity Agreement provides for
adjustments to be paid by us, or to us, depending on the final determination of
the amount of our Canadian non-capital losses, scientific research and
development expenditures and investment tax credits generated to December 31,
2008, to the extent that such amounts are more or less than the amounts
estimated at the time the Arrangement was executed. At December 31, 2008, we
have not accrued any amount owing, or receivable, as a result of the Indemnity
Agreement as we have not yet finalized our 2008 Canadian income tax return and
agreed upon any differences with Superior Plus.
RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS
Related parties include
shareholders with a significant ownership interest in us, together with their
subsidiaries and affiliates, our key management personnel and our
equity-accounted investees. Revenues and costs recognized from such transactions
reflect the prices and terms of sale and purchase transactions with related
parties, which are in accordance with normal trade practices. Related parties
include EBARA BALLARD and EBARA Corporation, and prior to the closing of the
AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008, Daimler and Ford. AFCC is not considered
to be a related party, as we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over AFCC’s strategic operating, investing or financing
policies.
We earn revenues from related
parties from the sale of products and services and from engineering development
revenues. We provide funding to related parties for the purposes of conducting
research and development on our behalf. We have also purchased intellectual
property and obtained licenses from, and granted licenses to, related parties.
As a result of the AFCC Transaction, related party transactions have been
reduced.

Summary of Quarterly
Results: There were no significant
seasonal variations in our quarterly results. Variations in our net income
(loss) for the above periods were affected primarily by the following
factors:

  Product and service
  revenues: Variations in fuel cell
  product revenues reflect the timing of our
  customers’ fuel cell vehicle, bus and field trial deployments. Product revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were
  positively impacted by $6.0 million by the
  commencement of shipments of fuel cell bus modules related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program.
  Testing and engineering service revenue to
  AFCC commenced in the first quarter of 2008. 
  Engineering development
  revenue: Variations in engineering
  development revenue reflect the timing of
  work performed and the achievements of milestones under the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell development program
  and from light duty automotive and fuel
  cell bus programs. As a result of the AFCC Transaction, there were no light duty automotive fuel program
  engineering development revenues
  subsequent to January 2008. In addition, the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell development program was completed in
  the third quarter of 2008. Engineering
  development revenue in the first three quarters of 2008 was positively impacted by $1.0 million of revenue
  related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic
  fuel cell bus program. 
  Operating expenditures: Operating expenses have declined in the four
  quarters of 2008 due to the impact of the
  AFCC Transaction. Operating expenses also reflect changes in the value of the
  Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses increased in the
  fourth quarter of 2007 due to severance and related costs of approximately
  $4.1 million incurred in conjunction with the AFCC Transaction.



  Depreciation and
  amortization: Depreciation and
  amortization has declined for the four
  quarters of 2008 as several assets became fully depreciated or
  amortized during 2007 and certain
  intangible assets were disposed of in the AFCC Transaction. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the
  fourth quarter of 2007 due to the
  acceleration of amortization on expired patents. Depreciation and amortization has declined for the first three quarters
  of 2007 as a significant amount of
  intangible assets acquired in 2001 became fully amortized in 2006. 
  Investment and other income:
  Investment income has continually
  declined for the last eight quarters due
  to declines in our cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios and declines in interest rates.
  Investment and other income was positively
  impacted in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008 by foreign exchange gains of
  $4.2 million, $3.3 million, $0.7 million,
  and $1.0 million, respectively, and was negatively impacted in the
  first, third and fourth quarters of 2008 by
  foreign exchange losses of $1.3 million, $0.5 million, and $2.9 million, respectively, due to fluctuations in
  the Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S.
  dollar, on our Canadian dollar-denominated cash and short-term investments and on our outstanding foreign
  exchange contracts to buy or sell Canadian
  dollars. Other income increased in the four quarters of 2008 due to the provision of administrative services to
  AFCC. 
  Loss on disposal and write-down of
  long-lived assets: The net loss for
  the fourth quarter of 2008 was negatively
  impacted by a $3.0 million write-down of our investment in Chrysalix and the third quarter of 2007 was
  negatively impacted by a $4.6 million
  write-down of our investment in Advanced Energy. 
  Gain on sale of assets held for sale:
  The net income for the first quarter
  of 2008 was significantly impacted by a
  $96.8 million gain on the sale of assets pursuant to the AFCC Transaction. 
RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES

An investment in our common shares

below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties,
including those that we do not know about now or that we currently deem
immaterial, may also adversely affect our business. For a more complete
discussion of risks and uncertainties summarized below which apply to our
business and our operating results, please see our Annual Information Form and
other filings with Canadian (www.sedar.com) and U.S. securities
regulatory authorities (www.sec.gov). These documents are
also available on our website at www.ballard.com.


Our business entails risks and
uncertainties that affect our outlook and eventual results of our business and
commercialization plans. The primary risks relate to meeting our product
development and commercialization milestones, which require that our products
exhibit the functionality, cost, durability and performance required in a
commercial product and that we have sufficient access to capital to fund these
activities. To be commercially useful, most of our products must be integrated
into products manufactured by system integrators or OEMs. There is no guarantee
that system integrators or OEMs will provide products that use our products as
components. There is also a risk that mass markets for certain of our products
may never develop, or that market acceptance might take longer to develop than
anticipated.
A summary of these identified
risks and uncertainties are as follows: 

  We may not be able to achieve
  commercialization of our products on the timetable we anticipate, or at all; 
  We expect our cash reserves will be reduced
  due to future operating losses, and we
  cannot provide certainty as to how long our cash reserves will last or that
  we will be able to access additional
  capital when necessary; 
  We may not be able to successfully execute
  our business plan; 
  Potential fluctuations in our financial and
  business results make forecasting difficult and may restrict our access to funding for our
  commercialization plan; 
  Exchange rate fluctuations are beyond our
  control and may have a material adverse
  effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or profitability; 
  Commodity price fluctuations are beyond our
  control and may have a material adverse
  effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and
  profitability; 
  A mass market for our products may never
  develop or may take longer to develop than
  we anticipate; 
  We have limited experience manufacturing fuel
  cell products on a commercial basis; 
  We are dependent on third party suppliers for
  the supply of key materials and components
  for our products; 
  We are dependent on systems integrators or
  Original Equipment Manufacturers to purchase certain of our products; 
  Global economic conditions are beyond our
  control and may have an adverse impact on
  our business or on our key suppliers and / or customers; 
  Public Policy and regulatory changes could
  hurt the market for our products; 
  We depend on our intellectual property and
  our failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and
  success; 
  We may be involved in intellectual property
  litigation that causes us to incur significant expenses or prevents us from selling our
  products; 
  We currently face and will continue to face
  significant competition; 
  We could lose or fail to attract the
  personnel necessary to run our business; 
  We could be liable for environmental damages
  resulting from our research, development or manufacturing
  operations; 
  Our products use flammable fuels, which could
  subject our business to product liability claims;


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Disclosure controls and
procedures 
Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is
gathered and reported to senior management, including the President and Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Corporate Controller and Acting Chief
Financial Officer (“CFO”), on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can
be made regarding public disclosure. 
As of the end of the period
covered by this report, we evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the CEO and the CFO, the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13(a) – 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
We have concluded that as of December 31, 2008, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified therein, and
accumulated and reported to management to allow timely discussions regarding
required disclosure. 
Internal control over financial
reporting 
The CEO and CFO, together with
other members of management, are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over the Company’s financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is designed under our supervision, and effected
by the Company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in Canada and the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, as
applicable.
There are inherent limitations in
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal controls can change with
circumstances. 
Management, including the CEO and
CFO, have evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting in relation to criteria described in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). Based on this evaluation, we have determined that internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

KPMG LLP, our independent
registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial
statements and expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. KPMG has also expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008. 


Changes in internal control
over financial reporting 
During the year ended December 31,
2008, there were no material changes in internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
Non-GAAP Measures

We use certain non-GAAP measures
to assist in assessing our financial performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP
measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are
therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other
companies. A description of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to financial
statement line items for the periods indicated are as follows: 
Normalized net
loss measures our net loss after
excluding items that are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal
continued operating activity of the business. Gains on sale of assets held for
sale, losses from discontinued operations and write-downs of long-lived assets
are not considered part of our core activities, and are expected to occur
infrequently. Therefore we have removed these in our calculation of normalized
net loss. We believe normalized net loss assists investors in assessing our
performance.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT

Management’s Responsibility for
the Financial Statements and
Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
The consolidated financial
statements contained in this Annual Report have been prepared by management in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The
integrity and objectivity of the data in these consolidated financial statements
are management’s responsibility. Management is also responsible for all other
information in the Annual Report and for ensuring that this information is
consistent, where appropriate, with the information and data contained in the
consolidated financial statements. 
Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect fraud or misstatements because of limitations inherent in any
system of internal control. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.
In addition, management maintains disclosure controls and procedures to provide
reasonable assurance that material information is communicated to management and
appropriately disclosed. Some of the assets and liabilities include amounts,
which are based on estimates and judgments, as their final determination is
dependent on future events. 
The Board of Directors oversees
management’s responsibilities for financial reporting through the Audit
Committee, which consists of five directors who are independent and not involved
in the daily operations of the Corporation. The Audit Committee meets on a
regular basis with management and the external and internal auditors to discuss
internal controls over the financial reporting process, auditing matters and
financial reporting issues. The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing
the external auditors (subject to shareholder approval), and reviewing and
approving all financial disclosure contained in our public documents and related
party transactions. 


The external auditors, KPMG LLP,
have audited the financial statements and expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. KPMG has also expressed an unqualified opinion on the effective
operation of the internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008. The external auditors have full access to management and the Audit
Committee with respect to their findings concerning the fairness of financial
reporting and the adequacy of internal controls.

AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Shareholders of Ballard
Power Systems Inc. 
We have audited the consolidated
balance sheets of Ballard Power Systems Inc. (the “Corporation") as at December
31, 2008 and 2007 and the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. With respect to
the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, we also conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
In our opinion, these consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Corporation as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2008 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted
accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2, 2009 expressed
an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of
Directors of Ballard Power Systems Inc. 
We have audited Ballard Power
Systems Inc. (the “Corporation")’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
presented in the section entitled “Management’s Report on Disclosure Controls
and Procedures and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting” under the heading
“Internal control over financial reporting” included in Management Discussion
and Analysis. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 
A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
We also have conducted our audits
on the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally
accepted auditing standards and in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our report dated March 2,
2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

    (a)
          
    Description of
      business:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The principal
      business of Ballard Power Systems Inc. (the “Corporation”) is the design,
      development, manufacture, sale and service of fuel cell products for a
      variety of applications. A fuel cell is an environmentally clean
      electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen (from the
      air) to produce electricity. Our technology is based on proton exchange
      membrane (“PEM”) fuel cells. The Corporation operated in three market
      segments:
  
    
    
    
     
  
    
    
    
    
      
        
        Power Generation:
        Fuel cell products and services
        for material handling, back-up power and residential co-generation
        purposes; 
        
        Automotive:
        Fuel cell products and services
        for fuel cell cars, vans and buses; and
        
        Material Products:
        Carbon fiber products primarily
        for automotive transmissions and gas diffusion layers (“GDL”) for fuel
        cells. 


  
             
    (b)
          
    Basis of
      presentation:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The consolidated
      financial statements of the Corporation have been prepared in accordance
      with Canadian GAAP. Material measurement differences to United States GAAP
      are disclosed in note 21.

    (c)
          
    Convergence with
      International Financial Reporting Standards
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    In February 2008,
      Canada’s Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) confirmed the date of
      changeover from GAAP to International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
      Canadian publicly accountable enterprises must adopt IFRS for their
      interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning
      on or after January 1, 2011. While IFRS uses a conceptual framework
      similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant differences on
      recognition, measurement and disclosures. The Corporation, with the
      assistance of an external expert advisor, has begun a high level review of
      the major differences between Canadian GAAP and IFRS. This work is
      expected to be completed in 2009.
  
    
      
  
    
    (d)
    
    Translation of
      foreign currencies:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The measurement
      currency of the Corporation is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign
      currencies are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the
      transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
      than the measurement currency are translated at the exchange rates in
      effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses
      are recognized in earnings.
  
    
     
  
    
    (e)
    
    Use of
      estimates:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The preparation
      of consolidated financial statements requires the Corporation’s management
      to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
      these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant
      areas requiring management to make estimates include the net realizable
      valued inventory, product warranty obligations, valuation of investments,
      revenue recognition and recoverability of intangibles and goodwill. Actual
      results could differ from those estimates.
  
    
     
  
    
    (f)
    
    Cash, cash
      equivalents and short-term investments:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Cash and cash
      equivalents consist of cash on deposit and highly liquid short-term
      interest-bearing securities with maturities at the date of purchase of
      three months or less.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Short-term
      investments consist of highly liquid interest bearing securities with
      maturities at the date of purchase between three months and three
      years.

    Financial
      instruments:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      measures its financial assets in the balance sheet at fair value, except
      for loans and receivables, which are measured at amortized cost. Financial
      liabilities classified as held for trading, including derivatives, are
      measured in the balance sheet at fair value; all other financial
      liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Long-term investments are
      measured at cost as they are privately held entities.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Measurement in
      subsequent periods depends on whether the financial instrument has been
      classified as held for trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity,
      loans and receivables, or other liabilities.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      classifies its accounts receivables as loans and receivables and its
      accounts payable and warranty liabilities as financial liabilities that
      are not classified as held for trading.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Periodically, the
      Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to limit its exposure
      to foreign currency rate fluctuations and to platinum price fluctuations.
      These derivative contracts are recorded as either assets or liabilities in
      the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Any changes in fair value
      are recognized in net income.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      does not designate its financial instruments as hedges.
  
    
     
  
    
    (h)
    
    Capital
      Disclosure:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Effective January
      1, 2008, the Corporation adopted the recommendations of the Canadian
      Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) for Capital Disclosures (CICA Handbook Section 1535). This new section
      establishes standards for disclosing information about an entity’s capital
      and how it is managed. This standard requires an entity to disclose: (i)
      its objectives, policies and processes for managing capital; (ii) summary
      quantitative data about what it manages as capital; (iii) whether during
      the period it complied with any externally imposed capital requirements to
      which it is subject; and (iv) when the entity has not complied with such
      requirements, the consequences of such non-compliance (note
  20).

    Significant accounting policies
(cont’d):


  
            
    (i)
          
    Inventories:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Inventories are
      recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of
      inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle, and includes
      expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or
      conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their
      existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories
      and work in progress, cost includes materials, labor and appropriate share
      of production overhead based on normal operating capacity. Costs of
      materials are determined on an average per unit basis. Net realizable
      value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business,
      less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. In
      establishing the appropriate inventory obsolescence, management estimates
      the likelihood that inventory carrying values will be affected by changes
      in market demand, technology and design, which would make inventory on
      hand obsolete.
  
    
     
  
    
    (j)
    
    Property, plant
      and equipment:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Property, plant
      and equipment are initially recorded at cost and are amortized from the
      date of acquisition or, in respect of internally constructed assets, from
      the time an asset is completed and ready for use, using the straight-line
      method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as
  follows:
  
    
     


  
                    
    
    Building  
    30 to 39
      years 
  
    
    Computer
      equipment  
      3
      to 7 years 
  
     
    Furniture and fixtures  
    5 to 14 years
    
  
    
    Leasehold
      improvements  
    The
      shorter of initial term of the respective 
  
    
      
    lease and
      estimated useful life 
  
    
    Production and test
      equipment  
    4 to 15
      years 


  
            
    (k)
          
    Goodwill and
      intangible assets:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Effective
      December 31, 2008, the Corporation early adopted the recommendations of
      the CICA for Goodwill and
      Intangible Assets (CICA Handbook
      Section 3064). The new standard provides more guidance on intangible
      assets and the recognition of internally generated intangible assets
      including research and development costs. This accounting standard was
      applied retrospectively, however there were no material impacts on prior
      period financial statements requiring restatement by adopting the new
      standard.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Research costs
      are expensed as they are incurred. Product development costs are expensed
      as incurred except when they meet specific criteria for deferral as set
      forth under Canadian GAAP.

    (k)
          
    Goodwill and
      intangible assets (cont’d):
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Goodwill is
      recognized in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements as the
      excess of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair values
      assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is
      assigned to reporting units of a market segment.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Intangible assets
      consist of fuel cell technology acquired from third parties and are
      recorded at cost. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated
      useful lives of 5 to 15 years using the straight-line method. Intangible
      assets are tested for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate
      that the estimated future net cash flows from the asset will be
      insufficient to cover its carrying value.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      tested goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in each of the
      reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology and determined
      that there was no impairment to goodwill and intangible
  assets.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Costs incurred in
      establishing and maintaining patents and license agreements are expensed
      in the period incurred.
  
    
     
  
    
    (l)
    
    Investments:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Investments in
      shares of companies over which the Corporation has the ability to exercise
      significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Investments
      in companies where significant influence does not exist are carried at
      cost.
  
    
     
  
    
    (m)
    
    Accrued warranty
      liabilities:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    A provision for
      warranty costs is recorded on product sales at the time of shipment. In
      establishing the accrued warranty liability, management estimates the
      likelihood that products sold will experience warranty claims and the
      estimated cost to resolve claims received, taking into account the nature
      of the contract and past and projected experience with the
    products.
  
    
     
  
    
    (n)
    
    Asset retirement
      obligations:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Legal obligations
      to retire tangible long-lived assets are recorded at fair value at
      acquisition with a corresponding increase in asset value. These include
      assets leased under operating leases. The liability is accreted over the
      life of the asset to fair value and the increase in asset value is
      depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset.

    (o)
          
    Revenue
      recognition:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
      exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable,
      and collectibility is reasonably assured.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Revenue from
      products is recognized when title passes to the customer and all of the
      revenue recognition criteria specified above is met. Revenue from
      engineering services is recognized as services are rendered and predefined
      milestones are achieved, or on the percentage of completion method of
      accounting. For contracts with multiple deliverables, the Corporation
      allocates revenue to each element of the contract based on objective
      evidence of the fair value of the element. Revenue from long-term fixed
      price service contracts is determined under the proportionate performance
      method where revenues are recognized on a pro-rata basis in the relation
      that contract costs incurred have to total contract costs. Unbilled
      revenue (included in accounts receivable) represents revenue earned in
      excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts. Deferred revenue
      represents cash received from customers in excess of revenue recognized on
      uncompleted contracts.
  
    
     
  
    
    (p)
    
    Income
      taxes:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
      Under this method, future income taxes are recognized for the future
      income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
      statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective
      income tax bases (temporary differences) and for loss carry-forwards. The
      resulting changes in the net future tax asset or liability are included in
      income. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted, or
      substantively enacted, tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
      the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
      settled. The effect on future income tax assets and liabilities, of a
      change in tax rates, is included in income in the period that includes the
      substantive enactment date. Future income tax assets are evaluated, and if
      realization is not considered to be “more likely than not,” a valuation
      allowance is provided.
  
    
     
  
    
    (q)
    
    Employee future
      benefit plans:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      has a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in the United
      States. In addition, the Corporation provides other retirement benefits
      for certain employees in the United States. The benefits are based on
      years of service and the employee’s compensation level. The Corporation
      accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans and the related
      costs, net of plan assets.

    Employee future
      benefit plans (cont’d):
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The cost of
      pensions earned by employees is actuarially determined using the projected
      benefit method prorated on service and management’s best estimate of
      expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, and retirement
      ages of employees. For the purpose of calculating the expected rate of
      return of plan assets, those assets have been valued at fair
    value.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The excess of the
      net actuarial gain (loss) over 10% of the greater of the benefit
      obligation, and the fair value of plan assets, is amortized over the
      average remaining service period of active employees.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Any increase in
      the projected benefit obligation resulting from amendments affecting prior
      service is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining service
      period of active plan participants who are expected to receive benefits
      under the plan on the date the amendment is first recognized. To the
      extent that the liability is not covered by assets of the plan, nor
      reflected in the accrued pension cost, there is a transition asset, or
      obligation, to be recognized over a specified period in accordance with an
      amortization schedule.
  
    
     
  
    
    (r)
    
    Share-based
      compensation plans:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      uses the fair-value based method of accounting for share-based
      compensation for all awards of shares and share options granted. The
      resulting compensation expense, calculated using the Black-Scholes
      valuation method and estimated for forfeitures, is charged to net income
      over the vesting period, whereby the compensation expense is recognized
      when services are received with a corresponding increase to contributed
      surplus.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation
      issues shares and share options under its share-based compensation plans
      as described in note 13. Any consideration paid by employees on exercise
      of share options or purchase of shares, together with the amount initially
      recorded in contributed surplus, is credited to share
capital.
  
    
     
  
    
    (s)
    
    Earnings (loss)
      per share:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Basic earnings
      (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
      shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is
      calculated using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock
      method, the dilution is calculated based upon the number of common shares
      issued should deferred share unites (“DSUs”), restricted share units
      (“RSUs”), and “in the money” options, if any, be exercised.

      comprehensive income (loss) represents changes in shareholders’ equity and
      includes items such as unrealized gains and losses on financial assets
      classified as available-for-sale, and cumulative translation adjustments.
      The Corporation has included a reconciliation of comprehensive income and
      accumulated other comprehensive income, which is presented as a separate
      category of shareholders’ equity, on the consolidated balance sheet and
      the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity.

      assistance and investment tax credits:
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    Government
      assistance and investment tax credits are recorded as either a reduction
      of the cost of the applicable assets, or credited against the related
      expense incurred in the statement of operations, as determined by the
      terms and conditions of the agreements under which the assistance is
      provided to the Corporation or the nature of the expenditures which gave
      rise to the credits. Government assistance and investment tax credit
      receivables are recorded when their receipt is reasonably
    assured.

    Non-dilutive financing:
  
    
    
      
  
    
    
    
      On December 31, 2008, the
      Corporation completed a restructuring transaction with Superior Plus
      Income Fund (“Superior Plus”) to reorganize the Corporation’s business
      under a Plan of Arrangement (the “Arrangement”). Pursuant to the
      Arrangement, Superior Plus transferred $38,029,000 (CDN $46,319,000) to
      the Corporation’s parent company (“Old Ballard”). Old Ballard subsequently
      transferred all of its assets and liabilities (including the net cash
      proceeds, but excluding Old Ballard’s historic Canadian income tax carry
      forward attributes), to a new wholly owned company, (“the Corporation”).
      Old Ballard’s shareholders exchanged their shares, on a one-for-one basis,
      for shares of the Corporation. The Corporation will now carry on the full
      scope of the Old Ballard’s business operations, and will hold all rights
      to intellectual property, as held by Old Ballard prior to the completion
      of the Arrangement.
      As the transfer of the
      business assets, liabilities and operations from Old Ballard to the
      Corporation represented a transaction with no change in shareholder
      ownership, the transaction was accounted for using continuity of interest
      accounting.

      Pursuant to continuity of
      interest accounting, the assets transferred and liabilities assumed were
      recorded at their carrying values as reported by the Corporation
      immediately prior to the completion of the Arrangement. As a result, the
      net cash proceeds were recorded as a credit to shareholders’ equity. In
      addition, as the future income tax benefits of Old Ballard’s Canadian
      non-capital losses, capital losses, scientific research and development
      expenditures and investment tax credits generated through to the date of
      the completion of the Arrangement are not available to the Corporation
      after the completion of the Arrangement, the gross future income tax
      assets related to these Canadian tax pools was reduced to nil, with a
      corresponding reduction of the related valuation allowance (note
      15).

      On January 31, 2008, the
      Corporation completed the sale of its automotive fuel cell research and
      development assets (the “AFCC Transaction”) to Daimler, Ford and AFCC
      Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. (“AFCC”). AFCC, which is controlled
      by Daimler and Ford, was created to carry on the development of automotive
      fuel cells for Daimler and Ford. Under the terms of the AFCC Transaction,
      the Corporation transferred to Daimler, Ford and AFCC its automotive
      patents, automotive fuel cell test equipment, automotive fuel cell
      inventory, $60,000,000, all automotive fuel cell warranty liabilities and
      all automotive fuel cell development contracts with Daimler and Ford,
      80.1% of the outstanding shares of AFCC (note 9), 112 personnel, and a
      royalty free, sub-licensable license to the Corporation’s remaining
      intellectual property for use in automotive applications. In exchange,
      Daimler and Ford returned to the Corporation an aggregate of 34,261,298 of
      its common shares valued at $173,900,000, one Class A share and one Class
      B share, collectively representing Daimler and Ford’s entire direct and
      indirect equity interest in the Corporation. These shares were then
      cancelled.

    Disposition of Ballard Power Systems Corporation:
  
    
    
     
  
    
    
    
      On February 15, 2007, the
      Corporation disposed of its electric drive operations, Ballard Power
      Systems Corporation (“BPSC”), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary to a
      third party. Net proceeds on disposition were $1,689,000, which included
      cash proceeds of $3,754,000, partly offset by disposal cost of $2,065,000.
      The total net loss on disposal of $108,464,000 was recorded as a net loss
      of $111,355,000 in 2006 and an offsetting net gain of $2,891,000 in 2007
      primarily as a result of employee future benefit plan curtailments in
      2007. Upon closing, the Corporation ceased to consolidate the results of
      BPSC.

      In 2008, changes in raw

      as cost of product and service revenues amounted to $25,948,000 (2007 -
      $21,252,000; 2006 – $13,677,000). In 2008, the write-down of inventories
      to net realizable value amounted to $745,000 (2007 - $1,375,000; 2006 -
      $2,301,000). There were no reversals of write-downs in 2008, 2007 or 2006.
      Write-downs and reversals are included in either cost of product and
      service revenues, or research and product development expense, depending
      on the nature of inventory.

      The Corporation maintains a
      19.9% interest in AFCC which is accounted for using the cost method and is
      subject to a share purchase agreement under which Ford, either at the
      option of the Corporation or Ford’s election, may purchase the
      Corporation’s interest in AFCC at any time after January 31, 2013 for
      $65,000,000 plus interest accruing at LIBOR from January 31, 2008. The
      purchase may take place earlier than January 13, 2013 if certain events
      occur. The Corporation has no obligation to fund any of AFCC’s operating
      expenses. The share purchase agreement is considered to be a derivative
      instrument and is recorded at its fair value of $1. This derivative
      investment is carried at cost and is not marked to market each reporting
      period as the Corporation has determined that it is not possible to
      reliably determine the derivative fair value.
  
    
    
     
  
    
    
    In 2007,
      the Corporation sold its 25% interest in Advanced Energy Technology Inc.
      (“Advanced Energy”) for proceeds of $541,000, recording a write-down of
      long-lived assets of $4,563,000.

      Long-term liabilities
      (cont’d):


  
       
         
    
      During 2008, the Corporation
      made an additional investment of $11,249,000 (2007 - $8,461,000), in EBARA
      BALLARD, representing the Corporation’s final committed proportionate
      share of financing by EBARA BALLARD’s shareholders under the 2005 funding
      agreement. In addition, the Corporation received from EBARA BALLARD the
      final payment (net of taxes) of $5,310,000 (2007 - $5,310,000), related to
      a license to certain intellectual property and manufacturing rights
      totaling (net of withholding taxes) $21,240,000. This receipt is recorded
      as a credit against the Corporation’s investment in EBARA
      BALLARD.
      In determining the fair
      value of the asset retirement obligations, the estimated future cash flows
      have been discounted at 12% per annum. The total undiscounted amount of
      the estimated cash flows required to settle this obligation is $3,441,000.
      The obligation will be settled at the end of the term of the operating
      lease, which extends to 2019.

      Employee future benefit
      plans:


  
       
         
    
      The Corporation maintains a
      defined benefit pension plan covering employees in the United States. The
      benefits under the pension plan are based on years of service and salary
      levels. Certain employees are also eligible for post-retirement
      healthcare, life insurance and other benefits. The measurement date used
      to determine pension and other post-retirement benefit measures for the
      pension plan and the post-retirement benefit plan is December 31 of each
      year. The most recent actuarial valuation of the pension plans for funding
      purposes was as of January 1, 2008.

      A one-percentage-point
      change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material
      impact on the Corporation’s financial statements.
      In 2007, due to the sale of
      BPSC (note 4), changes were made to benefits accruing to employees under
      both the pension and other benefit plans, which resulted in the
      recognition of curtailment gains of
$2,699,000.

      The Corporation has options

      employees of the Corporation, and its subsidiaries, are eligible to
      participate in the share option plans although as a matter of policy,
      options are currently not issued to directors. Option exercise prices are
      denominated in both Canadian and U.S. dollars, depending on the residency
      of the recipient. Canadian dollar denominated options have been converted
      to U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rate for presentation
      purposes. All options have a term of seven to ten years from the date of
      grant unless otherwise determined by the board of directors. One-third of
      the options vest and may be exercised, at the beginning of each of the
      second, third and fourth years after granting.

      The Corporation uses the
      fair-value method for recording employee and director share option grants.
      During 2008, compensation expense of $2,763,000 (2007 - $3,462,000; 2006 -
      $3,278,000) was recorded in net income as a result of fair value
      accounting for share options granted. The share options granted during the
      year had a weighted average fair value of $2.65 (2007 - $3.92; 2006 -
      $3.86) and vesting periods of three years.
      The fair values of the
      options granted were determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model
      under the following weighted average
assumptions:

      consideration to employees of the Corporation to recognize their past
      contribution and encourage future contribution to the Corporation. At
      December 31, 2008, there were 2,092,901 shares available to be issued
      under these plans.

      Corporation after the director or executive ceases to provide services to
      the Corporation. Shares will be issued from the Corporation’s share
      distribution plans. As at December 31, 2008, 333,066 DSUs (2007 – 299,991)
      were issued and outstanding, and $202,000 (2007 - $481,000; 2006 -

      The Corporation has agreed

      power products under two development programs with Canadian government
      agencies. The total combined royalty is limited in any year to 4% of
      revenue from such products. Under the terms of the Utilities Development
      Program (Phase 1) with the Governments of Canada and British Columbia, total royalties are
      payable to a maximum equal to the original amount of the government
      contributions of $8,787,000 (CDN$10,702,000). As at December 31, 2008, no
      royalties have been incurred for Phase 1. Under the terms of the Utilities
      Development Program (Phase 2) with Technology Partnerships Canada (“TPC”)
      total royalties are payable to a maximum of $31,469,000 (CDN$38,329,000).
      As at December 31, 2008, a total of $4,368,000 (CDN $5,320,000) in royalty
      repayments have been incurred for Phase 2 including payments of $151,000

      The Arrangement with
      Superior Plus (note 2) includes an indemnification agreement dated
      December 31, 2008 (the “Indemnity Agreement”), which sets out the parties’
      continuing obligations to the other. The Indemnity Agreement provides for
      the indemnification by each of the parties to the other for breaches of
      representations and warranties or covenants, as well as, in the
      Corporation’s case, any liability relating to the business which is
      suffered by Superior Plus. The Corporation’s indemnity to Superior Plus
      with respect to representation relating to the existence of the Corporation’s tax pools
      immediately prior to the completion of the Arrangement is limited to an
      aggregate of $6,034,000 (CDN $7,350,000) with a threshold amount of
      $411,000 (CDN $500,000) before there is an obligation to make a payment.
      The Indemnity Agreement also provides for adjustments to be paid by the
      Corporation, or to the Corporation, depending on the final determination
      of the amount of 2008 Canadian non-capital losses, scientific research and
      development expenditures and investment tax credits, to the extent that
      such amounts are more or less than the amounts estimated at the time the
      Arrangement was executed.
      At December 31, 2008, no
      amount payable or receivable has been accrued as a result of the Indemnity
      Agreement as the Corporation has not yet finalized its 2008 Canadian
      income tax return and agreed upon any differences with Superior
      Plus.

    As a result of
      the Arrangement (note 2), the Corporation’s gross future tax assets
      related to the Canadian tax pools, excluding Ballard Advanced Materials
      Corporation, were reduced to nil. 
      The Canadian scientific
      research expenditures and capital losses may be carried forward
      indefinitely. The German losses from operations may be used to offset
      future taxable income in Germany for corporate tax and trade tax purposes
      and may be carried forward indefinitely. The U.S. federal losses from
      operations may be used to offset future U.S. taxable income and expire
      over the period from 2011 to 2028. The U.S. states losses from operations
      arising in California and Massachusetts may be used to offset future state
      taxable income and may be carried forward for ten and five years
      respectively. The U.S. federal and state research and development and
      investment tax credits are available to reduce future U.S. taxable income
      and expire over the period from 2009 to 2027. The U.S. capital losses are
      available to reduce U.S. capital gains and expire over the period from
      2010 to 2012. 
      The Canadian investment tax
      credits may be used to offset future Canadian income taxes otherwise
      payable and expire as follows:

    Segmented
      financial information:
  
     
  
     
    
    The Corporation’s
      business operates in three market segments: Power Generation, Automotive,
      and Material Products. Segmented information excludes amounts reported as
      discontinued operations.
  
     
  
     
    
    Segment revenues
      and segment loss represent the primary financial measures used by senior
      management in assessing performance and allocating resources, and include
      the revenues, cost of product revenues and expenses for which management
      is held accountable. Segment expenses include research and product
      development costs directly related to individual segments. Costs
      associated with shared services and other costs are allocated based on
      headcount and square footage. Corporate amounts include expenses for
      research and product development, marketing and general and
      administrative, which apply generally across all segments and are reviewed
      separately by senior management.
  
     
  
     
    
    A significant
      portion of the Corporation’s production, testing and lab equipment,
      facilities, as well as intellectual property, are common across the
      segments. Therefore, management does not classify asset information on a
      segmented basis. Instead, performance assessments of these assets and
      related resource allocations are done on a company-wide
  basis.

    The

      receivable or its financial liabilities measured at amortized
    cost.
  
              
    
    
     
  
    
    a)
          
    Foreign currency exchange
      rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a
      financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange
      rates. The Corporation is exposed to currency risks primarily due to its
      holdings of Canadian dollar denominated cash equivalents and short-term
      investments and its Canadian dollar denominated purchases and accounts
      payable. Substantially all receivables are denominated in U.S.
      dollars.
  
    
     
  
    
     
    
    The Corporation limits its
      exposure to foreign currency risk by holding Canadian denominated cash,
      cash equivalents and short-term investments in amounts up to 100% of
      forecasted twelve month Canadian dollar net expenditures and up to 50% of
      the following twelve months of forecasted Canadian dollar net
      expenditures, thereby creating a natural hedge. Periodically, the
      Corporation also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to further
      limit its exposure. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had Canadian
      dollar cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of CDN
      $71,414,000, and outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts
      outstanding to sell a total of CDN $8,000,000 in 2009 at an average rate
      of $0.90 to $1.00 CDN.

    Based on cash, cash
      equivalents and short-term investments and outstanding forward foreign
      exchange contracts held at December 31, 2008, a 10% increase in the
      Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held
      constant, would result in an increase in foreign exchange gains of
      approximately $6,518,000. If the Canadian dollar weakened 10% against the
      U.S. dollar, there would be an equal, and opposite impact, on net income.
      This sensitivity analysis includes foreign currency denominated monetary
      items, and adjusts their translation at year-end, for a 10% change in
      foreign currency rates.
  
    
    
    
     
    
  
     
    
    b)
          
    Interest rate
      risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial
      instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The
      Corporation is exposed to interest rate risk arising primarily from
      fluctuations in interest rates on its cash, cash equivalents and
      short-term investments. The Corporation limits its exposure to interest
      rate risk by continually monitoring and adjusting portfolio duration to
      align to forecasted cash requirements and anticipated changes in interest
      rates.
  
     
  
     
    
     
    
    Based on cash,
      cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2008, a 0.25%
      decline in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would
      result in a decrease in investment income $213,000, arising mainly as a
      result of an increase in the fair value of fixed rate financial assets
      classified as held-for-trading. If interest rates had been 0.25% higher,
      there would be an equal and opposite impact on net income.
  
     
  
     
    
    c)
    
    Credit risk is
      the risk of financial loss to the Corporation if a counterparty to a
      financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises
      principally from the Corporation’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term
      investments and accounts receivable. The Corporation limits its exposure
      to credit risk on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments by
      only investing in liquid, investment grade securities. The Corporation
      manages its exposure to credit risk on accounts receivable by assessing
      the ability of counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the
      related contracts prior to entering into such contracts, and continuously
      monitors these exposures.

    Capital disclosures:
  
     
  
     
    
    As at
      December 31, 2008, the Corporation considers its shareholders’ equity as
      its capital. The Corporation does not have any bank debt or externally
      imposed capital requirements to which it is subject. The Corporation’s
      objectives when managing capital are to manage its capital with strong
      fiscal discipline; focus on markets with high product and service revenue
      growth potential; license technology in cases where it is advantageous to
      the Corporation; and access available government funding for research and
      development projects. The Corporation’s current financing principle is to
      maintain cash balances sufficient to fund at least six quarters of
      operating cash consumption at all times.
  
     
  
    21.
    
    Differences between Canadian and United States accounting
      principles and practices:
  
     
  
     
    
    These
      consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
      Canadian GAAP which differ in certain respects from those principles and
      practices that the Corporation would have followed had its consolidated
      financial statements been prepared in accordance with accounting
      principles and practices generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.
      GAAP”).
  
     
  
     
    
    (a)
          
    Under Canadian
      GAAP, the adoption of the U.S. dollar in 2001 as the presentation and
      measurement currency was implemented by translating all prior year
      financial statement amounts at the foreign exchange rate on December 31,
      2001. Under U.S. GAAP, a change in presentation and measurement currency
      is implemented retroactively, such that prior period financial statements
      are translated under the current rate method using foreign exchange rates
      in effect on those dates. As a result, there is a difference in the share
      capital, additional paid-in capital, accumulated deficit and accumulated
      other comprehensive income amounts under U.S. GAAP as compared to Canadian
      GAAP.
  
     
  
     
    
    (b)
    
    Under Canadian
      GAAP, the Corporation has accounted for funding received in prior years
      under the TPC agreement in accordance with specific pronouncements on
      accounting for government assistance by reducing research and product
      development expenses, cost of revenues, inventory and capital assets by
      the amount of the funding received.
  
     
  
     
    
     
    
    Under U.S. GAAP,
      there are no authoritative accounting standards addressing the various
      types of government assistance programs. Since the TPC funding combines
      the characteristics of a grant with some characteristics of a debt
      instrument, the Corporation has recorded the entire funding as long-term
      debt under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the U.S. GAAP liability is a Canadian
      dollar denominated liability and, as a result, foreign exchange gains and
      losses are incurred.

    Differences between Canadian and United States accounting
      principles and practices (cont’d):
  
     
  
     
    
    (c)
          
    Under Canadian
      GAAP, the Corporation is required to account for gains and losses on the
      issuance of shares by a subsidiary or other entity which the Corporation
      accounts for on an equity basis, as a component of income. Under U.S.
      GAAP, the effect of such dilution gains are recorded in equity, as an
      increase in paid-in capital rather than as income.
  
     
  
     
    
    (d)
    
    Prior to 2002,
      under Canadian GAAP, no compensation expense was recorded for employee
      share option plans under the intrinsic value method. The option exchange
      plan (note 13(b)) was accounted for as a variable option plan under U.S.
      GAAP. Prior to the Corporation’s 100% acquisition of BGS in 2003, minority
      interest under U.S. GAAP included the minority interest’s percentage share
      of compensation expense under variable plan accounting. The balance of the
      purchase price allocated to goodwill from the acquisition of the minority
      interest in BGS reflects this difference under U.S. GAAP.
  
     
  
     
    
    (e)
    
    Under Canadian
      GAAP, short-term investments are classified as held for trading and
      carried at fair market value with changes in fair market value recognized
      in net income. Under U.S. GAAP, the Corporation adopted Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
      Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159)”, effective January
      1, 2008 and elected to classify short-term investments as held for
      trading, making the treatment consistent with Canadian GAAP. Prior to
      that, the short-term investments were classified as available-for-sale and
      are carried at fair market value. As a result of the adoption of FAS 159,
      prior year gains of $4,733,000 have been reclassified from accumulated
      other comprehensive loss to accumulated deficit. Previously, unrealized
      holding gains and losses related to the short-term instruments were
      reflected as a separate component of shareholders’ equity under
      accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
  
     
  
     
    
    (f)
    
    Under Canadian GAAP,
      investments where no significant influence exists are accounted for using
      the cost method. Under U.S. GAAP, investments in limited partnerships such
      as Chrysalix are accounted for using the equity method. In 2008, Chrysalix
      was written down to its estimated net realizable value and there is no
      difference in the carrying value of such investment as of December 31,
      2008 between Canadian and US GAAP.

    Differences between Canadian and United States accounting
      principles and practices (cont’d):
  
     
  
     
    
    (g)
          
    Under U.S. GAAP,
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
      Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans, an
      amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132-R” (SFAS No. 158),
      requires an entity to recognize in its balance sheet the funded status of
      its defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans, measured as the
      difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit
      obligation. SFAS No. 158 also requires an entity to recognize changes in
      the funded status of a defined benefit pension and post-retirement plan
      within accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to the extent
      such changes are not recognized in earnings as components of periodic net
      benefit cost.
  
      
  
     
    
    (h)
    
    Under Canadian
      GAAP, assets and liabilities held for sale are presented separately on the
      balance sheet classified as current and non-current. Under U.S. GAAP,
      non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are classified as current
      when the sale is expected to be completed within one year.
  
     
  
     
    
    (i)
    
    Under Canadian
      GAAP, in-process research and development is amortized over its remaining
      useful life, which has been estimated as five years. Under U.S. GAAP,
      in-process research and development is written off immediately if it does
      not have any other alternative uses.
  
     
  
     
    
    (j)
    
    Under U.S. GAAP,
      no sub-total would be provided in the operating section of the
      consolidated statement of cash flows. There are no other differences in
      operating, investing and financing cash flows.
  
     
  
     
    
    (k)
    
    Under US GAAP,
      effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted FASB Interpretation No.
      48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of
      FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). FIN 48 established threshold and
      measurement attributes for financial statement measurement and recognition
      of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. There is
      no similar standard under Canadian GAAP. The adoption of FIN 48 did not
      have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial statements or
      require restatement on prior period financial statements under US
      GAAP.
