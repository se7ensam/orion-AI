Ballard Reports Second Quarter 2009 Results


For Immediate Release – July 28, 2009


VANCOUVER, CANADA– Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDP) announced revenue of $13.1
million and net income of $0.01 per share for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. All amounts
are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.


“Our core fuel cell products segment shows continued growth in the second quarter of 144% year over
year, however this growth was largely offset by declines in our supporting business segments,
reflecting the significant weakness in the automotive sector,” said John Sheridan, Ballard’s
President and CEO. He continued, “Profitability in the second quarter was driven by a one-time
accounting gain from unwinding our Japanese residential cogeneration systems joint venture, EBARA
Ballard.”


Considering the continued softness in Ballard’s legacy supporting business segments combined with
the general economic conditions, Ballard has revised its annual revenue guidance to $50 million to
$60 million. However, with regards to operating cash consumption, Ballard reconfirms its guidance
of $17 million to $27 million.

Second Quarter 2009 Financial Results


Quarter ended June 30, 2009

Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased to $13.1 million, or 6%, compared to
$12.4 million for the second quarter of 2008 as increases in the core Fuel Cell Products business
segment of $5.7 million more than offset declines in the supporting Contract Automotive and
Material Products business segments of $5.0 million.


In Ballard’s Fuel Cell Products business segment, revenues increased 144% to $9.7 million due
primarily to a $6.9 million, or 251%, increase in product and service revenues as a result of fuel
cell bus shipments for the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program (totaling $6.0 million)
combined with increases in backup power market revenues as a result of work completed on the
FirstEnergy Corp. distributed power generator project and increased unit shipments as a result of
the successful completion of the hydrogen unit product acceptance milestone with ACME Tele Power
Ltd. These increases were partially offset by lower shipments in the material handing market and
by lower residential cogeneration market revenues due to the absence of engineering development
revenues as a result of the completion of the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell development
program and due to the decision to discontinue operations in EBARA BALLARD in May 2009.


For the supporting Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments, revenues continued
to be negatively impacted by the slowdown in the automotive sector. Revenues in these supporting
areas decreased 59% to $3.4 million due to lower shipments of light-duty automotive fuel cell
modules, lower shipments of carbon friction material products, and lower testing and engineering
services provided to AFCC.


Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased to $1.0 million, or $0.01 per share,
compared with a net loss of $13.5 million, or ($0.16) per share, in the second quarter of 2008. The
second quarter net income in 2009 includes a non-cash gain of $10.8 million related to the decision
to discontinue operations in EBARA Ballard Corporation on May 24, 2009. EBARA BALLARD was a joint
venture with EBARA Corporation that was focused on the development, manufacture, sale, and
servicing of stationary power systems for the residential cogeneration market in Japan.


Normalized net loss1 for the second quarter of 2009 decreased $1.3 million, or 12%, to
$9.6 million, or ($0.11) per share, compared with a normalized net loss of $10.9 million, or
($0.13) per share, for the corresponding period of 2008. Reductions in operating expenses of $1.0
million combined with improvements in investment and other income of $0.8 million more than offset
the loss of engineering development revenues of $1.2 million.


Operating cash consumption1 for the second quarter of 2009 increased $11.9 million to
$17.0 million, compared to $5.1 million for the corresponding period in 2008. The higher operating
cash consumption was driven by higher working capital requirements of $9.6 million (net of
restructuring and related payments of $1.4 million) due primarily to the timing of collections of
product and service revenues and the payment of our remaining 2008 annual employee bonuses.
Increased capital expenditures of $2.2 million were partially offset by the lower normalized net
loss of $1.3 million.


Six months ended June 30, 2009

Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased to $21.2 million, or 25%, compared to
$28.4 million for the first two quarters of 2008, as increases in the core Fuel Cell Products
business segment of $3.2 million were more than offset by declines in the supporting Contract
Automotive and Material Products business segments of $10.4 million.


Fuel Cell Products revenues increased 31% to $13.6 million due primarily to a $6.7 million, or 99%,
increase in product and service revenues as a result of fuel cell bus shipments for the B.C.
Transit 2010 Olympic and the Transport of London fuel cell bus programs combined with increases in
backup power market revenues as a result of work completed on the First Energy distributed power
generator project and increased unit shipments as a result of the successful completion of the
hydrogen unit product acceptance milestone with ACME. These increases were partially offset by
lower shipments in the material handing market and by lower residential cogeneration market
revenues due to the absence of engineering development revenues as a result of the completion of
the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell development program and due to our decision to
discontinue operations in EBARA BALLARD in May 2009.


Contract Automotive and Material Products revenues decreased 58% to $7.6 million due to lower
shipments of light-duty automotive fuel cell modules, lower shipments of carbon friction material
products, and lower testing and engineering services provided to AFCC combined with the absence of
engineering development revenues due to the elimination of light-duty automotive fuel cell program
work subsequent to the closing of the AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008 (the “AFCC
Transaction”).


Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased to $17.6 million, or ($0.21) per share,
compared with net income of $67.6 million, or $0.77 per share, in the corresponding period of 2008.
The first half net income in 2008 includes a gain on sale of assets of $96.8 million related to the
AFCC Transaction. The first half net loss in 2009 includes a gain on discontinuance of operations
in EBARA BALLARD of $10.8 million and restructuring and related expenses of $1.4 million relating
to a 7% workforce reduction initiated in March 2009.


Normalized net loss1 for the first six months of 2009 increased 1%, or $0.3 million, to
$24.1 million, or ($0.29) per share, compared with a normalized net loss of $23.8 million, or
($0.27) per share, for the first six months of 2008. Product and service revenue and related gross
margin declines of $2.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, combined with lower engineering
development revenues of $5.2 million, were only partially offset by reductions in operating
expenses of $5.8 million (net of restructuring and related expenses of $1.4 million).


Operating cash consumption1 for the first half of 2009 increased $13.7 million to $27.9
million, compared to $14.2 million for the corresponding period in 2008. The higher operating cash
consumption was driven by higher working capital requirements of $7.2 million due primarily to the
timing of collections of product and service revenues and increased inventory investment, combined
with increased capital expenditures of $3.4 million and the slightly higher normalized net loss.

Endnotes:

1 Normalized net loss and operating cash consumption are non-GAAP measures used to
assist in assessing Ballard’s financial performance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar
measures presented by other companies. Normalized net loss measures Ballard’s net loss after
excluding items that are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal continued operating
activity of the business. Gains on sale of assets held for sale, losses from discontinued
operations, write-downs of long-lived assets, restructuring and related expenses, and equity
income (loss) in associated companies are not considered part of our core activities, and are
expected to occur infrequently. Therefore Ballard removes these in the calculation of normalized
net loss. Operating cash consumption measures the amount of cash required to fund the operating
activities of our business (net of restructuring and related costs) and excludes financing and
investing activities except for net additions to property, plant and equipment.
