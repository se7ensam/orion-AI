Attached herewith as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release, dated December 16, 2009,
whereby Acergy S.A. ("Acergy") announced that it has acquired the Borealis, a
DP3 dynamic positioning vessel equipped with a 5,000T crane, currently being
built at the Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore.  Acergy plans to install a 1,000T
J-Lay tower and state-of-the-art 600T S-Lay equipment. It will also be fitted
with a range of support systems and construction equipment for worldwide
deepwater and harsh environment operations. Provision will be made for accepting
one of the Company's heavy duty flexible pipelay systems.

Final completion and operational delivery of the ship is scheduled to take place

including approximately $260m relating to the acquisition of the ship and
delivery as per the original design. This investment will be funded entirely
from the Company's existing cash resources.
