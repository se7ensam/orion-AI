Advantest Corporation (FY2009 Q2)
 
At a meeting held on October 28, 2009, the Board of Directors resolved to distribute dividends from surplus, with a record date of September 30 2009 as above. The year-end dividends forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 has not been decided. For details, please refer to the “Notice
Concerning Distribution of Dividends from Surplus” released on October 28, 2009.


3. Projected Results for FY2009 (April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010)
(Note) Revision of earnings forecast for this period: None
Advantest’s business focuses on test systems for semiconductors, and relies heavily on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, test houses and foundries.  The capital expenditures of these companies are determined primarily by factors such as current or future trends in the demand for semiconductors.  Semiconductor
market analysts predict strengthening demand for netbooks and smartphones, as well as PC shipment growth driven by the release of new operating systems in late 2009, which will fuel demand for semiconductors. Although semiconductor manufacturers have begun to resume some capital expenditures, the recovery to date has not eliminated doubts about its sustainability. Accordingly, semiconductor manufacturers remain cautious on capital expenditures.  Because of the difficulty involved in forecasting earnings
in such an operating environment, the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 has not been presented. Advantest intends to promptly disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes possible.

The coordinated global response to last year’s financial crisis, together with measures implemented by national governments to stimulate domestic demand, began to take effect in the first quarter. As a result, signs of a worldwide economic recovery have been seen. The nascent recovery continued to gather steam in the second quarter,
led by the emerging markets of Asia, particularly China and India.
The semiconductor industry benefited from the stimulus packages adopted by governments around the world, which boosted demand for electronics and other consumer products. The supply-demand balance improved, and chip prices trended upwards. Productivity gains and streamlined cost structures also helped semiconductor makers to post improved
results. With their business environment improving, chip-makers have gradually begun to resume capital investment, which had been virtually frozen, renewing demand for Advantest’s test systems. While market conditions have improved, Advantest has also enhanced its profitability by switching to an operating structure that improves the company’s reaction speed and sensitivity to customers’ R&D and production activities, and by aggressive marketing new products that offer higher productivity.
As a result of these developments, orders and sales have been increasing since the first quarter. Orders input received was (Y) 14.4 billion (a 20.6% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 23.8% increase in comparison to the first quarter). Net sales were (Y) 11.2 billion (a 57.2% decrease in comparison
to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 46.6% increase in comparison to the first quarter). The percentage of net sales to overseas customers was 75.9%, compared to 71.3% in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Advantest continues its efforts to improve profitability through administrative cost-cutting measures, building on gains from the structural reforms launched in fiscal 2008. However, despite sequentially improved sales results, sales figures remain low by historical standards. Advantest recorded an operating loss of (Y) 3.5 billion and a loss
before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated company of (Y) 2.7 billion in the second quarter.

In the Semiconductor and Component Test Systems segment, though Advantest’s orders and sales were decreased compare to the second quarter of 2008, they were increased compare to the first quarter of 2009 as semiconductor manufacturers’ capital expenditures gradually recovered.
In the memory segment, orders and sales for DDR3 DRAM test systems increased in anticipation of growing demand for PCs that utilize these high-speed memory devices.
In non-memory, expectations of PC market growth contributed to continuing robust demand for test systems used in the manufacture of MPUs, although orders declined compare to the first quarter of 2009. Emerging markets continued to show a healthy appetite for LCD televisions, low-end PCs, and other consumer electronics, which encouraged manufacturers
to resume capital investment, and demands for LCD driver IC test systems grew.
As a result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 7.7 billion (a 32.7% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 3.6% increase in comparison to the first quarter), net sales were (Y) 7.1 billion (a 61.6% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 77.2% increase
in comparison to the first quarter) and operating loss was (Y) 2.2 billion.

Along with test systems, orders and sales for test handlers and device interface products received a sequential boost from the recovery in capital expenditures seen in the second quarter. The strongest gains came in orders for Advantest’s new, high-productivity test handlers, which benefited from ramped-up memory production.
As a result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 4.7 billion (a 65.9% increase in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 167.3% increase in comparison to the first quarter), net sales were (Y) 2.1 billion (a 63.7% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 56.5% increase
in comparison to the first quarter) and operating loss was (Y) 0.4 billion.

This segment also posted improved orders and sales due to higher equipment utilization rates at semiconductor manufacturing facilities, which contributed to a recovery in demand for maintenance services. As a result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 2.9 billion (a 28.3% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous
fiscal year, a 19.7% increase in comparison to the first quarter), net sales were (Y) 2.7 billion (a 30.7% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 21.5% increase in comparison to the first quarter) and operating income was (Y) 0.4 billion (a 26.1% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a 50.3% increase in comparison to the first quarter).


With respect to the qualitative information concerning the consolidated business results for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, please refer to “FY2009  First Quarter Consolidated Financial Results” (disclosed on July 29, 2009).


2.  Analysis of Financial Condition
Total assets at September 30, 2009 amounted to (Y) 186.8 billion, a decrease of (Y) 15.2 billion compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to decrease in short-term investments. The amount of total liabilities was (Y) 33.5 billion, a decrease of (Y) 4.9 billion compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to decrease in other accounts payable
and accrued expenses. Stockholders’ equity was (Y) 153.3 billion. Equity to assets ratio was 82.1%, an increase of 1.1 percentage point from March 31, 2009.


(Cash Flow Condition)
Cash and cash equivalents held at September 30, 2009 were (Y) 102.7 billion, an increase of (Y) 0.5 billion from June 30, 2009. Significant cash flows during the second quarter of this fiscal year and their causes are described below.
Net cash used in operating activities was (Y) 2.1 billion (Net cash in flow (Y) 12.4 billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount was primarily attributable to net loss of (Y) 3.3 billion.
Net cash provided by investing activities was (Y) 4.2 billion (Net cash out flow (Y) 5.6 billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount was primarily attributable to decrease in short-term investments in the amount of (Y) 4.9 billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount of (Y) 0.7 billion.
Net cash used in financing activities was (Y) 49 million (Net cash out flow (Y) 0.3 billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year).

3.  Prospects for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
As signs of economic resilience and rebounding consumption appear around the world, market analysts predict strengthening demand for netbooks and smartphones, as well as PC shipment growth driven by the release of new operating systems in late 2009, which will fuel demand for semiconductors. Although semiconductor manufacturers have
begun to resume some capital expenditures, the recovery to date has not eliminated doubts about its sustainability. Accordingly, semiconductor manufacturers remain cautious on capital expenditures.
In this operating environment, Advantest will continue to seek improved results by maintaining its new product development efforts and delivering solutions attractive to customers in the current climate. Additionally, together with expanding sales of its existing products, the company will focus on seeking alternative profit opportunities
by developing new businesses outside the semiconductor industry. Through the corporate initiative “1000 Days,” launched in July 2009, Advantest will continue to strive for further profitability gains through cost-cutting and improved productivity in its business operations.
As noted on the Information Summary sheet, Advantest has not yet disclosed a forecast of its full fiscal year results for FY2009. Such disclosure will be announced when it is possible.


4.  Others
(1) Material changes in subsidiaries during this period (changes in scope of consolidation resulting from changes in subsidiaries): Yes
Excluded  1: Advantest DI Corporation
Advantest DI Corporation was merged with Advantest Manufacturing, Inc. which is Advantest’s subsidiary on April 1, 2009.


(2) Use of simplified accounting method and special accounting policy for quarterly consolidated financial statements:
Tax expense is measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Advantest makes, at the end of the second quarter, its best estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and use that rate to provide for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis. The estimated effective tax rate includes the deferred tax effects
of expected year-end temporary differences and carryforwards, and the effects of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets.


(3)  Changes in accounting principles, procedures and the presentation of the quarterly consolidated financial statements: None
