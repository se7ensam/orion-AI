1. Basis of presentation:

The
accompanying financial information reflects the same accounting policies and
methods of application as the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2008, except for the changes in accounting
policies described in note 2. The accompanying financial information does not
include all disclosure required under Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) because certain information included in the Corporation’s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 has not
been included in this report. These consolidated financial statements are
unaudited but reflect all adjustments required for the fair presentation in
accordance with GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Certain
comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the basis of
presentation adopted in the current period.
2. Changes in accounting
policies and anticipated changes in accounting standards:
In
February 2008, Canada’s Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) confirmed the date
of changeover from GAAP to International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
Canadian publicly accountable enterprises must adopt IFRS for their interim and
annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after
January 1, 2011.
While
IFRS uses a conceptual framework similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant
differences on recognition, measurement and disclosures. The Corporation, with
the assistance of an external expert advisor, has begun a high level review of
the major differences between Canadian GAAP and IFRS. This work is expected to
be substantially complete by December 31, 2009.
In
January 2009, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued
new recommendations for Business
Combinations (CICA Handbook Section
1582), Consolidations (CICA Handbook Section 1601) and Non-Controlling Interests (CICA Handbook Section 1602). Section 1582 specifies a number of
changes, including: an expanded definition of a business, a requirement to
measure all business acquisitions at fair value, a requirement to measure
non-controlling interests at fair value, and a requirement to recognize
acquisition related costs as expenses. Section 1601 establishes standards for
the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Section 1602 specifies
that non-controlling interests be treated as a separate component of equity,
instead of a liability or other item outside of equity. The new standards will
become effective in 2011. The Corporation anticipates adopting these standards
in 2011 and is currently determining the impact of the standards on the
Corporation’s consolidated financial statements.

3. Non-dilutive financing:

On
December 31, 2008, the Corporation completed a restructuring transaction with
Superior Plus Income Fund (“Superior Plus”) to reorganize the Corporation’s
business under a Plan of Arrangement (the “Arrangement”). Pursuant to the
Arrangement, Superior Plus transferred $38,029,000 (CDN $46,319,000) to the
Corporation’s parent company (“Old Ballard”). Old Ballard subsequently
transferred all of its assets and liabilities (including the net cash proceeds,
but excluding Old Ballard’s historic Canadian income tax carry forward
attributes), to a new wholly-owned company (“the Corporation”). Old Ballard’s
shareholders exchanged their shares, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of the
Corporation. The Corporation is carrying on the full scope of Old Ballard’s
business operations, and holds all rights to intellectual property, as held by
Old Ballard before the completion of the Arrangement. As such, all references to
the Corporation in these Consolidated Financial Statements include Old Ballard
for matters occurring before the Arrangement.
As the
transfer of the business assets, liabilities and operations from Old Ballard to
the Corporation represented a transaction with no change in shareholder
ownership, the transaction was accounted for using continuity of interest
accounting. Pursuant to continuity of interest accounting, the assets
transferred and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values as
reported by Old Ballard immediately prior to the completion of the Arrangement.
As a result, the net cash proceeds were recorded as a credit to shareholders’
equity.
In
addition, as the future income tax benefits of Old Ballard’s Canadian
non-capital losses, capital losses, scientific research and development
expenditures and investment tax credits generated through to the date of the
completion of the Arrangement are not available to the Corporation after the
completion of the Arrangement, the gross future income tax assets related to
these Canadian tax pools was reduced to nil, with a corresponding reduction of
the related valuation allowance.

4. Disposition of Automotive
Assets:
On
January 31, 2008, the Corporation completed the sale of its automotive fuel cell
research and development assets (“the AFCC Transaction”) to Daimler AG
(“Daimler”), Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) and a newly created private
corporation, AFCC Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. (“AFCC”). AFCC was
created to carry on the development of automotive fuel cells for Daimler and
Ford. Under the terms of the AFCC Transaction, the Corporation transferred to
Daimler, Ford and AFCC its automotive patents, automotive fuel cell test
equipment, automotive fuel cell inventory, $60,000,000 in cash, the automotive
fuel cell warranty liabilities, all automotive fuel cell development contracts
between Ballard, Daimler and Ford, 80.1% of the outstanding shares of AFCC (note
5), 112 personnel and related office equipment and a royalty free,
sub-licensable license to the remaining Ballard intellectual property for use in
automotive applications. In exchange, Daimler and Ford returned to the
Corporation an aggregate of 34,261,298 of its common shares valued at
$173,900,000, one Class A share and one Class B share, collectively representing
Daimler and Ford’s entire direct and indirect equity interest in the
Corporation. These shares were then cancelled.
The
Corporation recorded a gain of $96,845,000 on the closing of the AFCC
Transaction.

Chrysalix Energy Limited Partnership (“Chrysalix”) is recorded at the
lower of cost and estimated net realizable value. As of December 31, 2008, the
Corporation recorded a write down to adjust the carrying value of Chrysalix to
its net realizable value of $500,000. During the three and six months ended June
30, 2009, the Corporation made additional investments of $ nil (2008 - $20,000)
and $156,000 (2008 - $256,000), respectively, in Chrysalix.
The
Corporation maintains a 19.9% interest in AFCC which is carried at cost and is
subject to a share purchase agreement under which Ford, either at the option of
the Corporation or Ford’s election, will purchase the Corporation’s interest in
AFCC at any time after January 31, 2013 for $65,000,000 plus interest accruing
at LIBOR. The purchase may take place earlier than January 31, 2013 if certain
events occur. The Corporation has no obligation to fund any of AFCC’s operating
expenses. This share purchase agreement is considered to be a derivative
instrument and was recorded at its fair value of $1 on the closing of the AFCC
Transaction.

6. Long-term liabilities
(cont’d):
In May
2009, the Company announced intentions to discontinue operations in EBARA
BALLARD Corporation (“EBARA BALLARD”), a joint venture with EBARA Corporation
(“Ebara”) that was focused on the development, manufacture, sale, and servicing
of stationary power systems for the residential cogeneration market in Japan.
EBARA BALLARD was accounted for using the equity method and was considered a
related party. On the announcement of the intention to discontinue operations,
the $10,838,000 of historic recorded equity losses in EBARA BALLARD in excess of
the net investment of EBARA BALLARD, was reversed to net income as (i) Ebara is
solely responsible for the liquidation obligations of EBARA BALLARD; and (ii)
the Corporation is not committed to provide, nor does it intend to provide, any
further financial support to EBARA BALLARD.
During
the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, the Corporation made a net
investment of $nil (2008 - $5,939,000) and $5,000,000 (2008 - $5,939,000),
respectively, in EBARA BALLARD representing the Corporation’s proportionate
share of financing by EBARA BALLARD shareholders in excess of licensing cash
receipts received from EBARA BALLARD. Recorded against this investment during
the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, is income of $10,838,000 and
$7,943,000, respectively, compared to a loss of $2,612,000 and $5,481,000 for
the corresponding periods in 2008 representing the Corporation’s proportionate
share of EBARA BALLARD’s equity losses.
The
Corporation maintains a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the United
States. The benefits under the pension plan are based on years of service and
salary levels. Certain employees are also eligible for post-retirement
healthcare, life insurance and other benefits. During the three and six months
ended June 30, 2009, $233,000 (2008 – ($11,000)) and $349,000 (2008 - $114,000),
respectively, was recorded as defined benefit expense of the Corporation’s
defined benefit pension plan and other benefit plan, in aggregate.

9. Segmented financial
information: 
For
2009, the Corporation’s market segments were reassessed due to the increased
focus on key growth opportunities with near-term commercial prospects in core
fuel cell markets. The Corporation’s business operates in three market segments:
Fuel Cell Products, Contract Automotive, and Material Products. The Fuel Cell
Products market segment is the Corporation’s core segment and includes
activities relating to the design, development, manufacture, sale and servicing
of fuel cell products for motive power (consisting of the material handling and
bus markets) and stationary power (consisting of the back-up power and
residential cogeneration markets) applications. The Corporation’s business
activities in the Contract Automotive market segment include contract
manufacturing of light-duty automotive fuel cell products and testing and
engineering services provided primarily to AFCC, Daimler and Ford. The
Corporation’s Material Products segment designs, develops, manufactures and
sells carbon fiber products primarily to automotive manufacturers for automotive
transmissions and gas diffusion layers for the fuel cell industry. The
comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the segmented
disclosure adopted in the current period. 
Segment
revenues and segment income (loss) represent the primary financial measures used
by senior management in assessing performance and allocating resources, and
include the revenues, cost of product and service revenues and expenses for
which management is held accountable. Segment expenses include research and
product development costs directly related to individual segments.
Costs
associated with shared services and other shared costs are allocated based on
headcount and square footage. Corporate amounts include expenses for research
and product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative,
which apply generally across all segments and are reviewed separately by senior
management.

9. Segmented financial information
(cont’d): 

A significant portion of the
Corporation’s production, testing and lab equipment, and facilities, as well as
intellectual property, are common across the segments. Therefore, management
does not classify asset information on a segmented basis. Instead, performance
assessments of these assets and related resource allocations are done on a
company-wide basis.

All amounts in this report are in
U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated. 
FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 
This document contains
forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management and
reflect our current expectations as contemplated under the safe harbor
provisions of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements with
respect to our objectives, goals and outlook including our estimated product
shipments, revenue and operating cash consumption (see Non-GAAP Measures), as
well as statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations,
anticipations, estimates and intentions. Words such as "estimate", "project",
"believe", "anticipate", "intend", "expect", "plan", "predict", "may", "should",
"will", the negatives of these words or other variations thereof and comparable
terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve assumptions,
risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.
In particular, these
forward-looking statements are based on certain specific assumptions relating to
our expectations with respect to the generation of new sales, producing,
delivering and selling the expected product volumes at the expected prices, and
controlling our costs. They are also based on a variety of general factors and
assumptions including, but not limited to, our expectations regarding product
development efforts, manufacturing capacity, product pricing, market demand, and
the availability and prices of raw materials, labour and supplies. These
assumptions have been derived from information available to the Company
including information obtained by the Company from third parties. These
assumptions may prove to be incorrect in whole or in part. In addition, actual
results may differ materially from those expressed, implied, or forecasted in
such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from the results expressed, implied or forecasted
in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the
condition of the global economy; the rate of mass adoption of our products;
changes in product pricing; changes in our customers' requirements, the
competitive environment and related market conditions; product development
delays; changes in the availability or price of raw materials, labour and
supplies; our ability to attract and retain business partners, suppliers,
employees and customers; changing environmental regulations; our access to
funding and our ability to provide the capital required for product development,
operations and marketing efforts; our ability to protect our intellectual
property; the magnitude of the rate of change of the Canadian dollar versus the
U.S. dollar; and the general assumption that none of the risks identified in the
Risks and Uncertainties section of this report or in our most recent Annual
Information Form will materialize. Readers should not place undue reliance on
Ballard's forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements
contained in this document speak only as of the date of this Management
Discussion and Analysis. Except as required by applicable legislation, Ballard
does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this Management Discussion and Analysis, including the occurrence of
unanticipated events.
SEGMENT DISCLOSURES

Over the past three years, we have
refined the Company’s business strategy to establish a sharp focus on what we
believe to be key growth opportunities with near-term commercial prospects in
our core fuel cell markets. For 2009, we are reporting our results in the
following market segments: 
1. Fuel Cell Products (core segment): fuel cell products and services for motive power
(material handling and bus markets) and stationary power (back-up power and
residential cogeneration markets);
2. Contract Automotive (supporting segment): contract technical and manufacturing services primarily for AFCC,
Daimler and Ford. 
3. Material Products (supporting segment): carbon
friction material products primarily for automotive applications and gas
diffusion layer (“GDL”) material for fuel cell products.
Comparative figures are presented
in conformance with our new operating segments.
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW – Quarter
ended June 30, 2009 
Revenue 
Our revenues for the three months
ended June 30, 2009 increased to $13.1 million, or 6%, compared to $12.4 million
for the second quarter of 2008 as increases in our core Fuel Cell Products
business segment of $5.7 million more than offset declines in our supporting
Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments of $5.0
million.
In our core Fuel Cell Products
business segment, revenues increased 144% to $9.7 million due primarily to a
$6.9 million, or 251%, increase in product and service revenues as a result of
fuel cell bus shipments for the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program
(totaling $6.0 million) combined with increases in back-up power market revenues
as a result of work completed on the FirstEnergy Corp. (“First Energy”)
distributed power generator project and increased unit shipments as a result of
the successful completion of the hydrogen unit product acceptance milestone with
ACME Tele Power Ltd. (“ACME”). These increases were partially offset by lower
shipments in the material handing market and by lower residential cogeneration
market revenues due to the absence of engineering development revenues as a
result of the completion of the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell
development program and due to our decision to discontinue operations in EBARA
BALLARD in May 2009.
Page 2 of 21


 
In our supporting Contract
Automotive and Material Products business segments, revenues continued to be
negatively impacted by the slowdown in the automotive sector. Revenues in these
supporting areas decreased 59% to $3.4 million due to lower shipments of
light-duty automotive fuel cell modules, lower shipments of carbon friction
material products, and lower testing and engineering services provided to
AFCC.
Net income (loss)

Our net income for the three
months ended June 30, 2009 increased to $1.0 million, or $0.01 per share,
compared with a net loss of $13.5 million, or ($0.16) per share, in the second
quarter of 2008. The second quarter net income in 2009 includes a non-cash gain
of $10.8 million related to our decision to discontinue operations in EBARA
Ballard Corporation (“EBARA BALLARD”) on May 24, 2009. EBARA BALLARD was a joint
venture with EBARA Corporation (“Ebara”) that was focused on the development,
manufacture, sale, and servicing of stationary power systems for the residential
cogeneration market in Japan.

Normalized net loss

Our normalized net loss (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for the second quarter of 2009 decreased $1.3 million, or
12%, to $9.6 million, or ($0.11) per share, compared with a normalized net loss
of $10.9 million, or ($0.13) per share, for the corresponding period of 2008.
Reductions in operating expenses of $1.0 million combined with improvements in
investment and other income of $0.8 million more than offset the loss of
engineering development revenues of $1.2 million. 
Operating cash consumption

Operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for the second quarter of 2009 increased $11.9 million to
$17.0 million, compared to $5.1 million for the corresponding period in 2008.
The higher operating cash consumption was driven by higher working capital
requirements of $9.6 million (net of restructuring and related payments of $1.4
million) due primarily to the timing of collections of our product and service
revenues, and the payment of our remaining 2008 annual employee bonuses.
Increased capital expenditures of $2.2 million were partially offset by the
lower normalized net loss of $1.3 million.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW – Six months
ended June 30, 2009
Revenue 
Our revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2009 decreased to $21.2 million, or 25%, compared to $28.4
million for the first two quarters of 2008, as increases in our core Fuel Cell
Products business segment of $3.2 million were more than offset by declines in
our supporting Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments of
$10.4 million.
Fuel Cell Products revenues
increased 31% to $13.6 million due primarily to a $6.7 million, or 99%, increase
in product and service revenues as a result of fuel cell bus shipments for the
B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic and the Transport of London fuel cell bus programs
combined with increases in back-up power market revenues as a result of work
completed on the First Energy distributed power generator project and increased
unit shipments as a result of the successful completion of the hydrogen unit
product acceptance milestone with ACME. These increases were partially offset by
lower shipments in the material handing market and by lower residential
cogeneration market revenues due to the absence of engineering development
revenues as a result of the completion of the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel
cell development program and due to our decision to discontinue operations in
EBARA BALLARD in May 2009. 
Contract Automotive and Material
Products revenues decreased 58% to $7.6 million due to lower shipments of
light-duty automotive fuel cell modules, lower shipments of carbon friction
material products, and lower testing and engineering services provided to AFCC
combined with the absence of engineering development revenues due to the
elimination of light-duty automotive fuel cell program work subsequent to the
closing of the AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008 (the “AFCC Transaction”).

Net income (loss)

Our net loss for the six months
ended June 30, 2009 increased to $17.6 million, or ($0.21) per share, compared
with net income of $67.6 million, or $0.77 per share, in the corresponding
period of 2008. The first half net income in 2008 includes a gain on sale of
assets of $96.8 million related to the AFCC Transaction. The first half net loss
in 2009 includes a gain on discontinuance of operations in EBARA BALLARD of
$10.8 million and restructuring and related expenses of $1.4 million relating to
a 7% workforce reduction initiated in March 2009. 
Normalized net loss

Our normalized net loss (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for the first six months of 2009 increased 1%, or $0.3
million, to $24.1 million, or ($0.29) per share, compared with a normalized net
loss of $23.8 million, or ($0.27) per share, for the first six months of 2008.
Product and service revenue and related gross margin declines of $2.1 million
and $1.5 million, respectively, combined with lower engineering development
revenues of $5.2 million, were only partially offset by reductions in operating
expenses of $5.8 million (net of restructuring and related expenses of $1.4
million).

Operating cash consumption

Operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for the first half of 2009 increased $13.7 million to $27.9
million, compared to $14.2 million for the corresponding period in 2008. The
higher operating cash consumption was driven by higher working capital
requirements of $7.2 million due primarily to the timing of collections of our
product and service revenues, increased inventory investment, combined with
increased capital expenditures of $3.4 million and the slightly higher
normalized net loss. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP, which require us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our
consolidated financial statements. We have identified the policies below as
critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of
operations. The application of these and other accounting policies are described
in note 1 to the 2008 annual consolidated financial statements. Our preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
We earn revenues under certain
contracts to provide product and engineering development services. These
contracts provide for the payment for products and services based on our
achieving defined milestones or on the performance of work under our product
development programs. Revenues are recognized under these contracts based on
assessments of progress achieved against these milestones or on the
proportionate performance method of accounting. There is a risk that a customer
may ultimately disagree with our assessment of the progress achieved against
milestones or that our estimates of the percentage of work completed could
change. Should this occur, the revenues recognized in the period might require
adjustment in a subsequent period.
Under the terms of certain other
contracts under which we earn product and engineering service revenue, revenue
is recognized based on the proportion of performance completed. There is a risk
that estimated costs to complete a contract might change, which may result in an
adjustment to previously recognized revenues.
During the three and six months
ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, there were no material adjustments to engineering
development revenue and product and engineering service revenue relating to
revenue recognized in a prior period.
WARRANTY PROVISION 
A provision for warranty costs is
recorded on product sales at the time of shipment. In establishing the accrued
warranty liabilities, we estimate the likelihood that products sold will
experience warranty claims and the cost to resolve claims received. In making
such determinations, we use estimates based on the nature of the contract and
past and projected experience with the products. Should these estimates prove to
be incorrect, we may incur costs different from those provided for in our
warranty provisions. During the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, we
recorded provisions to accrued warranty liabilities of $1.6 million and $0.2
million, respectively, for new product sales, compared to $2.0 million and $0.5
million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and
2008.
Page 5 of 21


 
We review our warranty assumptions
and make adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities quarterly based on the
latest information available and to reflect the expiry of contractual
obligations. Adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities are recorded in cost of
product and service revenues. As a result of these reviews and the resulting
adjustments, our warranty provision and cost of revenues for the three months
ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were adjusted downwards by a net amount of $0.2
million and $0.2 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30,
2009 and 2008 were adjusted downwards by a net amount of $0.3 million and $0.2
million, respectively. The adjustments to reduce accrued warranty liabilities
were primarily due to contractual expirations and improved lifetimes of our fuel
cell products.
INVENTORY PROVISION 
In determining the lower of cost
and net realizable value of our inventory and establishing the appropriate
provision for inventory obsolescence, we estimate the likelihood that inventory
carrying values will be affected by changes in market pricing or demand for our
products and by changes in technology or design which could make inventory on
hand obsolete or recoverable at less than cost. We perform regular reviews to
assess the impact of changes in technology and design, sales trends and other
changes on the carrying value of inventory. Where we determine that such changes
have occurred and will have a negative impact on the value of inventory on hand,
appropriate provisions are made. If there is a subsequent increase in the value
of inventory on hand, reversals of previous write-downs to net realizable value
are made. Unforeseen changes in these factors could result in additional
inventory provisions, or reversals of previous provisions, being required.
During the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, inventory provisions of
$0.1 million and nil, respectively, were recorded as a charge to cost of
product and service revenues, compared to $0.2 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. 
INVESTMENTS 
We have made strategic investments
in other companies or partnerships that are developing technology with potential
fuel cell applications. Each of these investments is either accounted for by the
equity method or carried at cost, depending on whether or not we have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the company or partnership. We
regularly review such investments and should circumstances indicate that an
impairment of value has occurred that is other than temporary, we would record
this impairment in the earnings of the current period. Given that these entities
are in the development stage, there is significant judgment required in
determining whether an impairment has occurred in the value of these investments
that must be recorded. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and
2008, no write-downs of our investments were recorded. During the three months
ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a gain of $10.8 million representing the
reversal of historic equity losses in excess of our net investment in EBARA
BALLARD as a result of the announcement of our intentions to discontinue
operations in EBARA BALLARD.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

In accordance with Canadian GAAP,
we do not amortize goodwill, and we amortize intangible assets over periods
ranging from five to 15 years. At least annually, we review the carrying value
of our intangible assets and goodwill by segment for potential impairment. Among
other things, this review considers the fair value of the business based on
discounted estimated cash flows. If circumstances indicate that impairment in
the value of these assets has occurred, we would record this impairment in the
earnings of the current period. During the three and six months ended June 30,
2009 and 2008, no write-downs of intangible assets or goodwill were recorded.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
AND DEVELOPMENTS
Convergence with International
Financial Reporting Standards 
In February 2008, Canada’s
Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) confirmed that Canadian GAAP, as used by
public companies, will be converged with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) effective January 1, 2011. The transition from Canadian GAAP
to IFRS will be applicable for us for the first quarter of 2011 when we will
prepare both the current and comparative financial information using IFRS.

While IFRS uses a conceptual
framework similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant differences on
recognition, measurement and disclosures. We commenced our IFRS conversion
project in the second quarter of 2008. The project consists of four phases:
awareness raising; assessment; design; and implementation. With the assistance
of an external expert advisor, we have completed the awareness-raising phase and
have begun a high level review of the major differences between Canadian GAAP
and IFRS (the assessment phase). It is expected that this work will be completed
during 2009. Subsequently, we will initiate the design phase, which will involve
establishing issue-specific work teams to focus on generating options and making
recommendations in identified areas. We will also establish a communications
plan, begin to develop staff training programs, and evaluate the impacts of the
IFRS transition on other business activities. 
Business Combinations

In January 2009, the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued new recommendations for
Business Combinations (CICA Handbook Section 1582), Consolidations
(CICA Handbook Section 1601) and Non-Controlling Interests (CICA
Handbook Section 1602). Section 1582 specifies a number of changes, including:
an expanded definition of a business; a requirement to measure all business
acquisitions at fair value; a requirement to measure non-controlling interests
at fair value; and a requirement to recognize acquisition related costs as
expenses. Section 1601 establishes standards for the preparation of consolidated
financial statements. Section 1602 specifies that non-controlling interests be
treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item
outside of equity. The new standards are harmonized with IFRS and will become
effective in 2011. We anticipate adopting these standards in 2011 and are
currently determining the impacts of the standards on our consolidated financial
statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2009 were $13.1
million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 6%, from the corresponding period in
2008 as increases in our core Fuel Cell Products business segment of $5.7
million more than offset declines in our supporting Contract Automotive and
Material Products business segments of $5.0 million.
Revenues for the six months ended
June 30, 2009 were $21.2 million, a decrease of $7.2 million, or 25%, from the
corresponding period in 2008 as increases in our core Fuel Cell Products
business segment of $3.2 million were more than offset by declines in our
supporting Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments of $10.4
million.

Fuel Cell Products product and
service revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 increased $6.9
million, or 252%, and $6.7 million, or 99%, respectively, compared to the
corresponding periods in 2008. Increased fuel cell bus revenues as a result of
the shipment of the remaining ten fuel cell bus modules for the B.C. Transit
2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program in the second quarter of 2009 ($6.0 million)
combined with fuel cell bus module shipments in the first quarter of 2009 for
the Transport of London fuel cell bus program drove the increase. Increases in
back-up power market revenues as a result of work completed on the First Energy
distributed power generator project combined with increased unit shipments as a
result of the successful completion of the hydrogen unit product acceptance
milestone with ACME were offset by lower shipments in the material handling and
residential cogeneration markets. Fuel Cell Products shipments for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2009 totaled 445 units and 635 units, respectively,
compared to 276 units and 532 units, respectively, in the same periods of 2008.

Fuel Cell Products engineering
development revenues were nil for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009,
a $1.2 million and a $3.5 million reduction, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2008. The absence of Fuel Cell Products engineering development
revenues in 2009 was expected due to the completion of our 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell program in the third quarter of 2008. The costs
associated with these engineering development revenues are included in research
and development expenses. 
Contract Automotive product and
service revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased $4.2
million, or 83%, and $7.5 million, or 73%, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2008, due to lower contract manufacturing of light-duty automotive
fuel cell products at lower prices to AFCC, Daimler and Ford, combined with
lower automotive service revenues derived primarily from testing and engineering
services to AFCC. Contract Automotive engineering development revenues were nil
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, a $1.6 million reduction
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2008. The absence of Contract
Automotive engineering development revenues in 2009 was expected due to the
closing of the AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008. The costs associated with
these engineering development revenues are included in research and development
expenses.
Material Products revenues for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased $0.7 million, or 22%, and
$1.3 million, or 22%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in
2008, due primarily to decreased volumes of carbon friction material products as
a result of the continued slow down in the U.S. automotive industry which were
only partially offset by growth in sales of gas diffusion layer (“GDL”) material
for fuel cell products. 
Cost of product and service
revenues for the three months ended
June 30, 2009 were $11.2 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 19%, compared
to the corresponding period of 2008. Cost of product and
service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were
$19.1 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 3%, compared to the corresponding
period of 2008. The 19% increase in the second quarter of 2009 is reflective of
the 17% increase in product and service revenues for that period, whereas the 3%
decrease in the first half of 2009 is due to the 9% decrease in product and
service revenues for that period partially offset by higher unabsorbed overhead
charges due to the overall revenue decline.
Page 9 of 21 


 
Gross margins on product and
service revenues increased to $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2009
compared to $1.7 million for the second quarter of 2008 whereas gross margins
decreased to $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, compared to
$3.6 million for the corresponding period of 2008. Increased gross margins in
the second quarter of 2009 as a result of shipments for the B.C. Transit 2010
Olympic fuel cell bus program and work performed on the First Energy distributed
power generator program more than offset the decline in gross margin due to
lower shipments of light-duty automotive and carbon fiber products. Gross
margins for the first half of 2009 are lower than the corresponding period of
2008 as these second quarter of 2009 gross margin improvements were offset by
higher unabsorbed overhead charges incurred in the first quarter of 2009 due to
the overall revenue decline in that quarter. 
Research and product
development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2009 were
$8.5 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 7%, compared to the corresponding
period of 2008. Research and product development expenses for the six months
ended June 30, 2009 were $16.3 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 21%,
compared to the corresponding period of 2008. This decline in expenditures is
due primarily to the disposition of our automotive fuel cell development
programs on the closing of the AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008, the
completion of our 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell program in the third
quarter of 2008 combined with the positive effects of a weaker Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar, which more than offset increased investment in our
Fuel Cell Products programs.
Included in research and product
development expenses for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2008,
were costs of $0.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related to our
achievement of predefined milestones for our customers under the development
programs for which we earned engineering development revenue. 
General and
administrative expenses for the
three months ended June 30, 2009 were $2.5 million, a decrease of $0.4 million,
or 14%, compared to the corresponding period of 2008. General and
administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were $6.9
million, consistent with the corresponding period of 2008. The decrease in the
second quarter of 2009 is due primarily to lower labour and insurance
expenditures combined with the positive effects of a weaker Canadian dollar,
relative to the U.S. dollar. General and administrative expenses in the six
months ended June 30, 2009 include restructuring and related expenses of $1.4
million relating to a 7% workforce reduction effected in March 2009. These
company-wide restructuring expenses offset the benefits of lower labour and
insurance expenditures and the positive effects of a weaker Canadian dollar,
relative to the U.S. dollar. 
Sales and marketing
expenses for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2009 were $1.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and
were comparable to the corresponding period of 2008. Increased investment in
sales and marketing capacity in 2009 in support of commercial efforts was offset
by the positive effects of a weaker Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S.
dollar.

Depreciation and
amortization was $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30,
2009, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 16%, compared to the corresponding period
of 2008. Depreciation and amortization was $2.3 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2009, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 25%, compared to the corresponding
period of 2008. Depreciation and amortization has declined in 2009 as some
assets became fully depreciated or amortized during 2008 and certain intangible
assets were disposed in the AFCC Transaction. 
Investment and other
income was $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30,
2009, compared to $1.7 million for the corresponding period of 2008. Investment
and other income was $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009,
compared to $1.9 million for the corresponding period of 2008. The following

Investment income was $0.1 million
and $0.4 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009,
respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 72%, and $1.1 million, or 75%,
compared to the corresponding period of 2008. The decrease was a result of
declining interest rates combined with lower average cash balances in 2009
compared to 2008. We classify our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments as held-for-trading and measure these assets at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in income. The fair values are determined
directly by reference to quoted market prices. During 2008 and into 2009, the
investment market was negatively impacted by liquidity and credit market
concerns along with increased concerns about a global economic slowdown. We
continue to review our exposure to these issues and have determined that there
are no material impacts on our investment portfolio.
Foreign exchange gains and losses
are attributable to the effect of the changes in the value of the Canadian
dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, on our Canadian dollar-denominated net
monetary assets and on outstanding foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell
Canadian dollars over the respective periods. The foreign exchange gain of $2.3
million for the second quarter of 2009 resulted primarily from the strengthening
of the Canadian dollar during the quarter and more than offset the first quarter
of 2009 foreign exchange loss, which had resulted primarily from the weakening
of the Canadian dollar during that quarter. Compared to the U.S. dollar, the
Canadian dollar has strengthened to 1.16 at June 30, 2009 as compared to 1.22 at
December 31, 2008 and 1.26 at March 31, 2009. In addition to foreign exchange
contracts, we hold Canadian dollar cash and short-term investments to reduce the
foreign currency risk inherent in expenditures denominated in Canadian dollars.
Our foreign denominated cash and short-term investments do not qualify for hedge
accounting and therefore foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized when
they occur.

Other income was $0.1 million and
$0.3 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009,
respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 67%, and $0.5 million, or 63%,
compared to the corresponding period of 2008. The decline was expected due to
fewer administrative support services provided to AFCC in the period.
Gain on assets held for
sale was $96.8 million for the three and six months ended June
30, 2008, reflecting the disposition of automotive assets pursuant to the AFCC
Transaction. 
Equity income (loss) of
associated companies was income of
$10.8 million and $7.9 million for the three and six month periods ended June
30, 2009, respectively, compared to a loss of $2.6 million and $5.5 million for
the corresponding periods of 2008 which related to our share of the losses of
EBARA BALLARD. On the announcement of our decision in May 2009 to discontinue
operations in EBARA BALLARD, the $10.8 million of historic recorded equity
losses in EBARA BALLARD in excess of our net investment in EBARA BALLARD, was
reversed to net income as (i) Ebara is solely responsible for the liquidation
obligations of EBARA BALLARD; and (ii) we are not committed to provide, nor do
we intend to provide, any further financial support to EBARA BALLARD. At March
31, 2009, our investment in EBARA BALLARD was recorded as a long-term liability
as our proportionate share of losses in EBARA BALLARD exceeded our net
investment in EBARA BALLARD, and prior to our decision to discontinue operations
in EBARA BALLARD, we were intending to provide additional financial support to
EBARA BALLARD. EBARA BALLARD was focused on the introduction of its next
generation system product for the residential cogeneration market in
Japan.
CASH FLOWS, LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES 
CASH FLOWS 
Cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments were $48.2 million as at June 30, 2009, compared to $85.4
million at the end of 2008. The decrease of $37.2 million in 2009 was driven by
a net loss (excluding non-cash items) of $21.1 million, an advance to EBARA
BALLARD of $5.0 million, net capital expenditures of $5.0 million, payment of
non-dilutive financing costs of $3.1 million and working capital cash outflows
of $3.2 million.  
Page 12 of 21 


 
For the three months ended June
30, 2009, working capital requirements resulted in cash outflows of $7.9 million
compared to cash inflows of $3.1 million for the corresponding period of 2008.
In the second quarter of 2009, net cash outflows of $7.9 million were driven by
higher accounts receivable of $5.6 million due to the timing of collections of
our product and service revenues, lower accounts payable of $3.5 million due
primarily to the payment of accrued 2008 annual employee bonuses and accrued
restructuring and related costs, and the draw down of deferred revenue of $1.6
million due primarily to amounts earned under the First Energy distributed power
generator program. These working capital outflows in the second quarter of 2009
were partially offset by cash inflows from lower inventory expenditures of $1.8
million and higher accrued warranty liabilities of $1.7 million due primarily to
product shipments for the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program.
Working capital inflows of $3.1 million during the second quarter of 2008 were
driven by lower accounts receivable of $3.2 million due to the timing of
customer collections combined with higher deferred revenue of $1.3 million due
to the timing of payments on pre-funded contracts. These second quarter of 2008
working capital inflows were partially offset by cash outflows from reductions
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $0.6 million, higher inventory of
$0.6 million, and higher prepaid expenses of $0.3 million due to the timing of
insurance renewals.
For the six months ended June 30,
2009, working capital requirements resulted in cash outflows of $3.2 million
compared to cash inflows of $4.0 million for the corresponding period of 2008.
In the first half of 2009, net cash outflows of $3.2 million were driven by the
draw down of deferred revenue of $2.5 million due primarily to amounts earned
under the First Energy distributed power generator program, lower accounts
payable of $1.3 million due primarily to the payment of accrued employee
bonuses, and higher inventory of $1.5 million. These first half of 2009 working
capital outflows were partially offset by cash inflows from higher accrued
warranty liabilities of $1.9 million due primarily to product shipments for the
B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program, and lower accounts receivable
of $0.9 million due to the timing of customer collections. Working capital
inflows of $4.0 million during the first half of 2008 were driven by lower
accounts receivable of $4.3 million due to the timing of customer collections,
lower inventory of $1.5 million due primarily to increased automotive shipments
and lower platinum inventory, and higher deferred revenue of $1.3 million due to
the timing of payments on pre-funded contracts. These first half of 2008 working
capital inflows were partially offset by cash outflows from reductions in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.5 million, primarily as a result
of payment of 2007 annual employee bonuses.
Investing activities resulted in
cash outflows of $3.8 million and $3.5 million for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively, compared to cash inflows of $17.9
million and cash outflows of $3.7 million during the corresponding periods of
2008. Changes in short-term investments resulted in cash outflows of $1.3
million and cash inflows of $6.3 million, respectively, for the three and six
month periods ended June 30, 2009. Changes in short-term investments resulted in
cash inflows of $24.7 million and $65.2 million, respectively, for the three and
six month periods ended June 30, 2008. Balances changed between cash equivalents
and short-term investments as we make investment decisions with regards to the
term of investments and our future cash requirements. Net capital spending of
$2.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2009, and $0.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2008, relates primarily to building
production capacity. 
Page 13 of 21 


 
The cash flows used for other
investing activities in the first half of 2009 of $5.2 million include an
investment in EBARA BALLARD of $5.0 million and an investment in Chrysalix
Energy Limited Partnership of $0.2 million. The cash flows used for other
investing activities of $6.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2008 represent a net investment in EBARA
BALLARD of $5.9 million, comprising of an additional investment of $11.2 million
offset by licensing cash receipts of $5.3 million, combined with an investment
in Chrysalix Energy Limited Partnership of $0.3 million. 
Financing activities resulted in
cash outflows of $0.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2009 and represent closing costs paid in 2009 which
were accrued at December 31, 2008 on the closing of the Arrangement with
Superior Plus Income Fund. 
As at July 28, 2009, we had
83,940,682 common shares issued and outstanding and stock options to purchase
5,739,660 of our common shares outstanding. 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As at June 30, 2009, we had cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $48.2 million. We will use
our funds to meet net funding requirements for the development and
commercialization of products in our target markets. This includes research and
product development for fuel cells and material products, the purchase of
equipment for our manufacturing and testing facilities, the further development
of business systems and low-cost manufacturing processes and the further
development of our marketing, product distribution and service capabilities.

At this stage of our development,
we expect to record losses for at least the next few years as we continue to
make significant investments in research and product and market development
activities necessary to commercialize our products. Our actual funding
requirements will vary based on the factors noted above, our relationships with
our lead customers and strategic partners, our success in developing new
channels to market and relationships with customers, our success in generating
revenue growth from near-term product opportunities, our working capital
requirements, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the progress and results of our
research, development and demonstration programs. 
Our financial strategy is to
manage our cash resources with strong fiscal discipline, focus on markets with
high product and service revenue growth potential, license technology in cases
where it is advantageous to us, and access available government funding for
research and development projects. Our current financing principle is to
maintain cash balances sufficient to fund at least six quarters of operating
cash consumption at all times. We believe that our current cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, combined with our ability to potentially
monetize other assets, including our interest in AFCC through the share purchase
agreement with Ford (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements & Contractual
Obligations section), are sufficient to meet our planned growth and development
activities for the foreseeable future without the need to access public market
financing. However, circumstances could change which would make it advantageous
for us to access additional capital.

OUTLOOK
The world’s financial crisis and
liquidity concerns continued through the first two quarters of 2009 and the
resultant economic slowdown has deepened. Reduced consumer demand, lower
availability of credit and reduced access to capital markets has impacted demand
for fuel cell products from some of our customers as well as the end users of
some of our products. This economic slowdown has been most acute in the
automotive sector and has negatively impacted revenues in our supporting
Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments. While our core Fuel
Cell Products segment is facing increased risks, we continue to expect revenue
from this core business to increase in 2009, as compared to 2008. 
We now expect overall revenues for
2009 to be between $50 million to $60 million, compared to $59.6 million in
2008, and down from our first quarter of 2009 guidance of $68 million. This
change in guidance is reflective of the tough economy and is a result of broad
based impacts on our business, including: (i) lower than anticipated technical
services and contract manufacturing for AFCC, Daimler and Ford in our non-core
Contract Automotive segment; (ii) lower than anticipated carbon friction
material product sales to automotive manufacturers in our non-core Material
Products segment (iii) weaker than expected performance in the material handling
market; and (iv) lower than anticipated residential cogeneration sales due to
the wind-down of operations in EBARA BALLARD. Our revenue outlook for 2009 is
based on our revised internal revenue forecast as of July 16, 2009 which
reflects the circumstances described above, takes into account actual sales in
the first half of 2009, sales orders received for units and services to be
delivered in the last half of 2009, and an estimate with respect to the
generation of new sales in each of our markets.
We continue to expect that core
Fuel Cell Products revenue will increase in 2009, as compared to 2008, due to
volume increases in our back-up power and bus markets as a result of our
announced agreements with ACME (subject to natural gas unit product acceptance
test in the fourth quarter of 2009), the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus
program, the Transport of London fuel cell bus program and new opportunities in
the distributed power generation sector that we are currently pursuing,
including our announced agreement with First Energy. These increases are
expected to more than offset lower material handling and residential
cogeneration revenues.
We had previously indicated that
we expected to ship 4,000 fuel cell units in 2009, as compared to 1,855 units in
2008. Due to weaker than expected performance in the material handling market,
lower residential cogeneration shipments (initial 500 unit target) due to the
wind-down of operations in EBARA BALLARD, and increased risks and uncertainties
in our back-up power market, we now expect this total shipment number to be
reduced. In addition, our revised revenue forecast includes a change in business
mix to fewer, larger value units moving this metric disproportionately to
revenue dollars. While we will continue to provide actual unit shipments in
future Management Discussion and Analysis, we will no longer provide guidance on
total expected unit shipments for the year.
Page 15 of 21 


 
We continue to expect our
operating cash consumption (see Non-GAAP Measures) for 2009 to be between $17
million to $27 million, compared to $29.3 million in 2008. The anticipated
improvement in operating cash consumption for 2009, as compared to 2008, is
based on our expectation that lower operating expenses will more than offset our
increased investment in manufacturing capacity and the expected declines in
gross margin as a result of the change in revenue expectations. As a result of
the timing of capital expenditures, working capital impacts related to the B.C.
Transit 2010 Olympic and Transport of London fuel cell bus programs, and the
payment of 2008 employee bonuses in the first half of 2009, operating cash
consumption is expected to be higher in the first half of 2009, as compared to
the second half of the year. In March 2009, we initiated a 7% workforce
reduction, a Company-wide salary freeze and numerous other cost containment
measures to assist in the achievement of this goal. Our operating cash
consumption outlook for 2009 is based on our internal forecast as of July 16,
2009 and takes into account actual results in the first half of 2009, our
forecasted gross margin and working capital impacts related to the above revised
revenue forecast, the costs of our current operating expense base adjusted for
additional planned cost containment measures, and assumes an average U.S. dollar
exchange rate of 1.15 in relation to the Canadian dollar. 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
& CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
We maintain a 19.9% interest in
AFCC which is subject to a share purchase agreement under which Ford, either at
our option or Ford’s election, may purchase our interest in AFCC at any time on
or after January 31, 2013 for $65 million plus interest accruing at LIBOR from
January 31, 2008. The purchase may take place earlier than January 31, 2013 if
certain other events occur. Under Canadian GAAP, this share purchase agreement
is considered a derivative instrument and is therefore measured and recorded at
its fair value on the closing of the AFCC Transaction. We have recorded this
derivative at its fair value of $1 representing the difference between the
discounted present value of the share purchase agreement on closing and the
value of the underlying transferred AFCC assets. This derivative instrument is
carried at cost and is not marked to market each reporting period, as we do not
believe it is possible to regularly determine its reliable fair value. If the
share purchase agreement were to be held to maturity and exercised on January
31, 2013, we anticipate that we would receive proceeds of approximately $68
million (based on current interest rates) and record an estimated gain of
approximately $67 million on the sale of our remaining 19.9% interest in AFCC.
If we were to monetize this share purchase agreement prior to its maturity date
of January 31, 2013, the amount of proceeds received would be subject to a
number of variables including Ford’s cost of borrowing, expected future LIBOR
rates, time remaining to January 31, 2013 and general market and other
conditions. Under present economic conditions, we believe that these factors
would result in a significant discount to the face value of the share purchase
agreement. 
Periodically, we use foreign
exchange contracts to manage our exposure to currency rate fluctuations and
platinum forward purchase contracts to manage our exposure to platinum price
fluctuations. We record these contracts at their fair value as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our
consolidated statements of operations. At June 30, 2009, we had outstanding
forward exchange contracts to sell a total of Canadian $4 million at an average
rate of $1.12 Canadian per $1.00 United States dollar, resulting in an
unrealized loss of $0.1 million. In addition, we had outstanding platinum
forward purchase contracts to purchase a total of $2.8 million of platinum at an
average rate of $1,050 per troy ounce, resulting in an unrealized gain of $0.5
million.

During 2009, a Canadian
governmental agency agreed to terminate potential royalties payable of $4.6
million (Cdn. $5.3 million) in respect of future sales of fuel cell-based
stationary power products under a historic development program. As a result,
total royalties payable in respect of future sales of fuel cell-based stationary
power products under two development programs with certain Canadian government
agencies have been reduced from up to a maximum of $42.2 million (Cdn. $49.0
million) at December 31, 2008 to a maximum of $37.7 million (Cdn. $43.7 million)
at June 30, 2009. To June 30, 2009, we have made total royalty payments of $4.6
million (Cdn. $5.3 million) against this potential obligation, including royalty
payments of $0.1 million (Cdn. $0.1 million) in 2009. The conditions under which
these royalties become payable are described in more detail in note 14 to the
annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.

As at June 30, 2009, there were no
other significant changes in our contractual obligations and commercial
commitments from those reported in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis for
the year ended December 31, 2008. 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Related parties include
shareholders with a significant ownership interest in us, together with their
subsidiaries and affiliates, our key management personnel and our
equity-accounted investees. Revenues and costs recognized from such transactions
reflect the prices and terms of sale and purchase transactions with related
parties, which are in accordance with normal trade practices. Related parties
include EBARA BALLARD and EBARA Corporation, and prior to the closing of the
AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008, Daimler and Ford. AFCC is not considered
to be a related party, as we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over AFCC’s strategic operating, investing or financing
policies.
We earn revenues from related
parties from the sale of products and services and from engineering development
revenues. We provide funding to related parties for the purposes of conducting
research and development on our behalf. We have also purchased intellectual
property and obtained licenses from, and granted licenses to, related parties.
As a result of the AFCC Transaction, related party transactions have been
reduced.

Summary of Quarterly
Results: There were no significant
seasonal variations in our quarterly results. Variations in our net income
(loss) for the above periods were affected primarily by the following factors:


  Product and service
  revenues: Variations in fuel cell
  product revenues reflect the timing of our customers’ fuel cell vehicle, bus
  and field trial deployments. Product revenues in the second quarter of 2009
  and the fourth quarter of 2008 were positively impacted by the shipments of
  fuel cell bus modules related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus
  program totaling $6.0 million in each of those quarters. Revenue from testing
  and engineering services to AFCC commenced in the first quarter of 2008.
  Variations in fuel cell service revenues reflect the timing of work performed
  and the achievements of milestones under the First Energy distributed power
  generator program which commenced in the second quarter of 2009 and from
  government contracts in the material handling and back-up power
  markets.

  Engineering development revenue: Variations in engineering development revenue reflect the timing of
  work performed and the achievements of milestones under the 1kW residential
  cogeneration fuel cell development program and from light duty automotive and
  fuel cell bus programs. As a result of the AFCC Transaction, there were no
  light duty automotive fuel program engineering development revenues subsequent
  to January 2008. In addition, the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell
  development program was completed in the third quarter of 2008. Engineering
  development revenue in the first three quarters of 2008 was positively
  impacted by $1.0 million of revenue related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic
  fuel cell bus program. 
  Operating expenditures:
  Operating expenses have declined in the first two quarters of 2009 and the
  four quarters of 2008 due to the impact of the AFCC Transaction combined with cost reduction initiatives
  undertaken throughout the business in 2009. Operating expenses also reflect
  changes in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Operating
  expenses also include restructuring and related expenses of $1.4 million in
  the first quarter of 2009 and $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of
  2007. 
  Depreciation and amortization:
  Depreciation and amortization has declined for the first two quarters of 2009
  and the four quarters of 2008 as several assets became fully depreciated or
  amortized during 2007 and certain intangible assets were disposed of in the
  AFCC Transaction. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the
  fourth quarter of 2007 due to the acceleration of amortization on expired
  patents. 
  Investment and other income: Investment and other income include foreign exchange gains (losses),
  investment income, and other income. Foreign exchange gains (losses) have
  varied in each quarter due to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, relative to
  the U.S. dollar, on our Canadian dollar-denominated cash and short-term
  investments, and on our outstanding foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell
  Canadian dollars. Investment income has continually declined for the last
  eight quarters due to declines in our cash equivalents and short-term
  investment portfolios and declines in interest rates. Other income declined in
  the first two quarters of 2008 and increased in the four quarters of 2008 due
  to the changing level of administrative support services provided to
  AFCC. 
  Loss
  on disposal and write-down of long-lived assets: The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was
  negatively impacted by a $3.0 million write-down of our investment in
  Chrysalix and the third quarter of 2007 was negatively impacted by a $4.6
  million write-down of our investment in Advanced Energy Technology
  Inc. 
  Gain
  on sale of assets held for sale: The
  net income for the first quarter of 2008 was significantly impacted by a $96.8
  million gain on the sale of assets pursuant to the AFCC
  Transaction.

  Equity income (loss) of
  associated companies: The net income for
  the second quarter of 2009 was significantly impacted by a $10.8 million gain
  recorded on the discontinuance of operations in EBARA BALLARD, representing
  the reversal of our historic recorded equity losses in EBARA BALLARD in excess
  of our net investment in EBARA BALLARD at that time. Net income (loss) for the
  first quarter of 2009, the four quarters of 2008, and the last two quarters of
  2007, was impacted by equity losses in EBARA BALLARD ranging from $1.1 million
  to $2.9 million, respectively, per quarter.
RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES

Risks and uncertainties related to
economic and industry factors are described in detail in our 2009 Annual
Information Form and remain substantially unchanged.
For additional information
relating to Ballard, please see our Annual Information Form and other filings
with Canadian (www.sedar.com) and U.S. (www.sec.gov) securities regulatory
authorities. These documents are also available on our website at www.ballard.com.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
During the most recent interim
period ending June 30, 2009, we did not make any significant changes in the
design of internal controls over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 
NON-GAAP MEASURES

We use certain non-GAAP measures
to assist in assessing our financial performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP
measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are
therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other
companies. A description of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to financial
statement line items for the periods indicated are as follows: 
Normalized net
loss measures our net loss after
excluding items that are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal
continued operating activity of the business. Gains on sale of assets held for
sale, losses from discontinued operations, write-downs of long-lived assets,
restructuring and related expenses, and equity income (loss) in associated
companies are either not considered part of our core activities, or are expected
to occur infrequently. Therefore we have removed these items in our calculation
of normalized net loss. We believe normalized net loss assists investors in
assessing our actual and future performance.

Operating cash
consumption measures the amount of
cash required to fund the operating activities of our business (net of
restructuring and related costs) and excludes financing and investing activities
except for net additions to property, plant and equipment. We believe operating
cash consumption assists investors in assessing our requirements to fund future
operations.
