                       Acergy S.A. Annual General Meeting
                    and dividend effect on Convertible Notes

London, England - May 22, 2009 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock
Exchange: ACY), advises that at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on
May 22, 2009, resolutions 1 to 8 inclusive were approved by shareholders. It was
noted that the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for resolutions
9 and 10 was not present and the Meeting of shareholders was therefore not able
to consider these resolutions.

The Board of Directors may call a second meeting of Shareholders to consider
resolutions 9 and 10. At such a meeting there is no requirement for a quorum.

Following their re-election, and with effect from the closing of the Annual
General Meeting of shareholders on May 22, 2009, Sir Peter Mason has been
appointed Chairman and Mr Tom Ehret has been appointed Deputy Chairman.

The payment of a dividend of $0.22 per common share for shareholders of record
on May 28, 2009 was approved. The first trading date ex-dividend will be May 26,
2009 and the date of payment of dividend will be June 12, 2009 and June 17, 2009
for holders of our ADRs.

Accordingly, the Company would like to inform holders of convertible bonds that,
in accordance with clause 6B3 of the terms and conditions of the convertible
bond, the new conversion price of the Bonds will be $22.71.

The minutes of the Annual General Meeting detailing the resolutions proposed and
the result of the poll on resolutions 1-8 is attached hereto.

          Minutes of the Annual General Meeting held at the offices of
             SERVICES GENERAUX DE GESTION S.A., 412F, route d'Esch,
                           Luxembourg on May 22, 2009

The Meeting was opened at 2.00 p.m.

Chairman      : Mr. Mark WOOLVERIDGE, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
                Company

Secretary     : Maitre Jean HOSS

Ballot-judges : Mrs. Chantal MATHU and Mrs. Celine BONVALET

The Chairman declared and the Meeting noted that:

o    it appeared from the main register kept by SERVICES GENERAUX DE GESTION
     S.A. and the Branch Register kept by DnB NOR Bank ASA of Oslo produced to
     the Meeting together with proxies duly filed within the statutory period
     that 62,227,292 Common Shares out of 194,953,972 issued Common Shares and
     182,850,343 outstanding Common Shares as at March 31, 2009 were represented

o    the notice of the Meeting was published according to the legal requirements
     in a Luxembourg daily newspaper and in the "Memorial C" on April 7, 2009
     and May 5, 2009 as evidenced by the documents presented to the Meeting and
     in accordance with article 26 of the Articles of Association (i) notice of
     this Meeting together with a proxy card, a letter of explanation and a
     business reply envelope have been mailed to the Common Shareholders on the
     Company's Registers as of March 31, 2009 and (ii) notice of this Meeting
     together with a proxy card, the letter of explanation and a business reply
     envelope were also mailed to the holders of American Depositary Shares
     (ADSs) (each of which represents one Common Share of the Company) on the
     register of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Depositary for the ADSs,
     as of March 31, 2009

o    in order to attend the present Meeting, the Common Shares represented
     complied with the legal and statutory requirements

o    the present Meeting was therefore regularly convened and has the legal
     power to act on the items 1 to 8 inclusive of the agenda. Since a
     resolution on items 9 and 10 requires a quorum of 50% of the outstanding
     shares, which is not present, the Meeting of Shareholders is thus not able
     to consider such resolutions. The Board of Directors of the Company may
     call a second meeting of shareholders to consider resolutions 9 and 10. At
     such a meeting there is no requirement for a quorum.
