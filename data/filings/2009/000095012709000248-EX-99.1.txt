                Acergy S.A. Pre-Close Trading Update and Outlook

London, England - November 25, 2009 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock
Exchange: ACY), issues this Pre-Close Trading Update and Outlook ahead of
results for the fourth quarter ended November 30, 2009, which are expected to be
announced on February 17, 2010.

2009 Pre-Close Trading Update

Guidance for fiscal year 2009 remains unchanged, namely:

     -    We expect revenue from continuing operations for 2009 to be in line
          with previous guidance.

     -    We expect to achieve an Adjusted EBITDA(a) margin for continuing
          operations in line with previous guidance. This remains below the
          outturn for continuing operations in 2008.

The effective rate of tax for the underlying business is anticipated to be
within the 35% guidance previously provided.

Cash balances at fiscal year end are expected to be approximately $900 million
after capital expenditure of approximately $180 million and paid dividends to
shareholders of $40 million.

Depreciation and amortisation costs are anticipated to be approximately $130
million.

Acergy is expected to end the 2009 fiscal year with a backlog for continuing
operations of approximately $2.9 billion, based on prevailing exchange rates,
including approximately $1.6 billion for execution in 2010.

2010 Outlook

Based on our current view, we expect that 2010 will see revenue from continuing
operations in line with the 2009 outturn.

Due to keener competition for new tenders, together with continued irregular
timing of project awards and completions we expect the Adjusted EBITDA margin
for continuing operations for 2010 to be lower than the Adjusted EBITDA margin
for continuing operations achieved in 2009.

The effective rate of tax for fiscal year 2010 is expected to be higher than the
2009 rate for the underlying business due to the expected geographical mix of
profits.

Maintenance capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $90 million.
Cash expenditure for 2010 is anticipated to be $140 million, including the
expected carry forward of payments from 2009. These estimates exclude any major
strategic capital expenditure or any expenditure specifically related to
tenders.

Depreciation and amortisation costs are expected to be approximately $140
million.


Commenting on today's statement, Jean Cahuzac, Chief Executive Officer, said:
"Despite the challenge of short-term market conditions, the medium-term
fundamentals of our industry remain encouragingly strong. We are confident that
our skills and strengths meet our clients' strategic needs, particularly in the
development of hydrocarbon discoveries secured in challenging acreage.

Acergy is well placed, both financially and operationally, to capitalise on
asset opportunities, should they emerge, and to exploit new growth areas when
stronger market conditions return."

(a) Adjusted EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing
operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and
amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other
gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to
exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment.
Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important
indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
("IFRS") as issued by the IASB nor as endorsed for use in the European Union.
These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst
our various regions, as they eliminate the effects of financing and
depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a
useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by
shareholders and analysts following the Group's performance. However, Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the
Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies. Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance
with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") that apply to reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented
differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or
not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from
continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and
should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net
income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group's
operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance
with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group's liquidity. The reconciliation of the
Group's net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing
operations is included in this release. This release also includes a
supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations
calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation
and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and equipment.
Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from
continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation
of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy's peer group and
therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies
within Acergy's industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is
calculated as per methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total
operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.

Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may
include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
statements may be identified by the use of words like "anticipate," "believe,"
"estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "forecast", "project," "will,"
"should," "seek," and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not
limited to, statements as to the expected timing of publishing 2009 fourth
quarter financial results in 2010, statements as to estimated revenues and
expectations as to the Adjusted EBITDA margin, depreciation and amortisation
costs, effective tax rates, cash balances, capital expenditure commitments for
the fiscal years 2009 and 2010, statements as to the expected backlog at the end
of fiscal year 2009, statements as to future operational performance, statements
as to short, medium and long-term outlooks and statements as to the expected
level of activity for 2010. The forward-looking statements reflect our current
views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following
factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause
actual and future results and trends to differ materially from our
forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant
projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and
businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the
outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries;
uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of
ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the
impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and
environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or
predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements.
