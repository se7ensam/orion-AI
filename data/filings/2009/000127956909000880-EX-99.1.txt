	    Attention Business Editors:
	    Advantage Announces Future Capital Development Plans at Glacier and
	    provides Updated Corporate Guidance

	    (AVN.UN - TSX, AAV - NYSE)

	    CALGARY, July 8 /CNW/ - Advantage Energy Income Fund ("Advantage" or "the
Fund") announces that the Board of Directors has approved a capital budget and
guidance for the twelve month period beginning July 2009 and ending June 2010.
Management will review the capital program on a regular basis in the context
of prevailing economic conditions and make adjustments as deemed necessary to
the program, subject to review by the Board of Directors.
	    Advantage's corporate capital budget for the 12 month period ending June
2010 has been set at $207 million. The budget will focus on development of our
Montney natural gas resource play at Glacier, Alberta where Advantage will
continue to employ a phased development approach. Phase I of the development
plan was achieved during Q2 2009 where production capacity was increased to
approximately 25 mmcfd and included wells, compression facilities and
additional pipelines. Phase II of the development plan will be undertaken
during the next 12 months and will result in production capacity increasing to
approximately 50 mmcfd by mid-year 2010. Phase III of the development plan
will result in the attainment of 100 mmcfd by mid-year 2011.
	    The Alberta Government's recently announced extension of the energy
incentive programs to March 31, 2011 will provide substantial benefits to all
three phases of our Glacier development plan. The energy incentive programs
will allow Advantage to capitalize on lower drilling costs (through a drilling
royalty credit of up to $200 per meter of drilled depth subject to a corporate
ceiling) and an initial five per cent royalty rate on the first 500 mmcf of
production for new wells based on our go-forward drilling plans for each of
the three phases of development.

	    Glacier Phase II Development Plan

	    Phase II of the Glacier development plan includes the drilling and
completion of 16 gross (16.0 net) horizontal operated wells, up to 16 gross
(6.1 net) joint interest horizontal wells and 1 gross (1.0 net) vertical well
during the next twelve months. Drilling plans will continue to balance
production and reserve growth and delineation of our extensive 89 section
gross (average 90% working interest) Montney land block. Drilling resumed in
early July at Glacier with the deployment of four drilling rigs on operated
and joint interest lands.
	    Phase II also includes the expansion of the existing gas gathering
system, additional compression and a new Advantage operated gas plant to
complement the existing infrastructure and provide total processing and
production capacity of 50 mmcfd. The majority of the wells drilled during the
last half of 2009 will be tied-in during the second quarter of 2010 when the
facilities expansions are expected to be completed.
	    Glacier capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $84
million net for the remainder of 2009 and $81 million net for the first half
of 2010. Approximately $116 million will be allocated to drilling and
completions with $29 million for well equipping and tie-ins and $20 million
for facilities and plant expansion.

	    Funds From Operations and Hedging Summary

	    Funds from operations for the above 12 month period ending June 2010
which is based on the mid-range of guidance is estimated at $204 million using
an average Nymex natural gas price of $5.19 US/mmbtu (AECO $4.97 Cdn/mcf), WTI
oil price of $73.87 US/bbl and an $0.86 Cdn/$US exchange rate. Advantage's
current hedging positions have been included in the funds from operations
estimate.
	    Advantage has a significant portion of our natural gas and crude oil
hedged through to the end of 2010. Our strategy will be to continue to employ
a multi-year hedging program to reduce the volatility in cash flow in support
of capital requirements.
