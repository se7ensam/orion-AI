 on Share Capital&#150;Ordinary Shares&#148;) at the closing of the Merger exceeds
 $12,000,000, and subject to adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement, all as

 the revised form of Indemnification Agreement entered into

 indemnifiable events listed in the Indemnification Agreement are foreseeable in
 light of our activities and that the limit established in the Indemnification Agreement
 is reasonable under the circumstances), (c) approved the D&#038;O Insurance Renewal,
 (d) approved the purchase of the Run-Off Insurance, and (e) resolved to recommend

 each of Proposals 1, 2 and 3 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
 of our ordinary shares present, in person or by proxy, at the Meeting where a quorum
 is present and voting on the proposal, not including abstentions and broker non-votes.
 Record holders of our outstanding ordinary shares as of January 21, 2009, the record
 date, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting, and are entitled to
 one vote at the Meeting per ordinary share held. Our outstanding ordinary shares
 constitute the only outstanding class of our share capital.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">However, with
 respect to the Merger Proposal (Proposal 1), there is an additional requirement
 for the approval, namely that a majority of the shares that are present and voting

 Agreements, each of those shareholders has agreed, among other things, to vote all
 of the ordinary shares owned by him in favor of the approval and adoption of the
 Merger Agreement, and the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
 thereby. We urge you to read the Voting Agreement attached as <i>Appendix B</i>
 to the accompanying Proxy Statement carefully in its entirety.</font></p>

 in accordance with their best judgment.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Only holders
 of record of the Aladdin Shares at the close of business on the record date, January 21, 2009, are entitled to notice
 of, and to vote at, the Meeting. As of January 11, 2009, there were</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">2</font></p>
<page>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">13,936,721 Aladdin Shares outstanding and
 entitled to vote. Each Aladdin Share outstanding on the record date will entitle
 its holder to one vote upon each of the matters to be presented at the Meeting.</font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">A quorum must
 be present in order for the Meeting to be held. At least two shareholders present
 in person or by proxy, and holding or representing, in the aggregate, at least thirty
 three and one third percent (33.33%) of the voting power of our company, will constitute
 a quorum at the Meeting. Aladdin Shares that are voted in person or by proxy
 &#147;FOR&#148; or &#147;AGAINST&#148; are treated as being present at the Meeting
 for purposes of establishing a quorum and are also treated as voted at the Meeting
 with respect to such matters. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for
 purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
 of business, but such abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes
 of determining the number of votes cast with respect to the particular proposal.
 If within half an hour from the time appointed for the holding of the Meeting a
 quorum is not present, the Meeting will stand adjourned until one week thereafter
 at the same time and place. If within half an hour from the time appointed for holding
 of the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present, the persons present will constitute
 a quorum for the business for which the original Meeting was called.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Provided that
 a quorum is present, approval of each of Proposals 1, 2 and 3 requires the affirmative
 vote of the holders of a majority of the Aladdin Shares present (in person or by
 proxy) at the Meeting and voting on such proposal (not including abstentions and
 broker non-votes).</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">However, with
 respect to the Merger Proposal (Proposal 1), there is an additional requirement
 for the approval, namely that a majority of the shares that are present and voting
 at the Meeting in person or by proxy (excluding Aladdin Shares held by (a) Purchaser,
 Merger Sub or any other person or entity holding, directly or indirectly, 25% or
 more of the voting power or the right to appoint 25% or more of the directors of
 the Purchaser or Merger Sub, (b) a person or entity acting on behalf of the Purchaser,
 Merger Sub or a person or entity described in clause (a) above; or (c) a family
 member of, or an entity controlled by the Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of the foregoing
 (any such person or entity described in this paragraph is referred to throughout
 this Proxy Statement as a Purchaser Affiliate)) will not have voted against the
 Merger. Therefore, in order for your vote to count towards this special majority
 on the Merger Proposal (Proposal 1), you must not have indicated on the proxy card
 that you are a Purchaser Affiliate. If you so indicate, your vote will not count
 towards this special majority.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">As of January
 13, 2009, Purchaser and its affiliates owned 1,977,464 Aladdin Shares. In addition,
 Purchaser and its affiliates control, in the aggregate, an additional 2,782,744
 Aladdin Shares pursuant to voting agreements by and between Jacob (Yanki) Margalit,
 our Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Dany Margalit, a director of our company,
 and Purchaser and Merger Sub, in the form attached as <i>Appendix B</i> (such voting
 agreements are referred to throughout this Proxy Statement as the Voting Agreements),

<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Shareholders
 may elect to vote their shares once, either by attending the Meeting in person,
 or by executing and delivering to Aladdin a proxy as detailed below. If your Aladdin
 Shares are held in &#147;street name&#148; through a bank, broker or other nominee,
 you may either direct such bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares or obtain a legal
 proxy from such bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares at the Meeting.

<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Proxies will
 be solicited by our Board of Directors. Proxies will be solicited by mail and will
 be mailed to our shareholders on or about January 27, 2009. Certain of our officers,

 mail or other personal contact. However, such parties will not receive additional
 compensation therefor. We will bear the cost of the solicitation of</font></p>

 the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the proxy materials, and will reimburse
 the reasonable expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding such proxy
 materials to the beneficial owners of our shares. In addition, we have engaged D.
 F. King &#038; Co., Inc., as the proxy solicitor in connection with this solicitation.
</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">If you own
 Aladdin Shares that are traded through the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange, or TASE, you
 may only vote your shares in one of the following two ways: (a) <i>By mail</i>:
 sign and date a voting instructions card in the form filed by us on MAGNA on January
 16, 2009 and attach to it a proof of ownership certificate from the TASE Clearing
 House member through which the shares are held indicating that you were the beneficial
 owner of the shares on the record date, and return the proxy card or voting instructions
 card, along with the proof of ownership certificate, to us, as described in the
 instructions available on MAGNA; or (b) <i>In person</i>: attend the annual meeting,
 where ballots will be provided. If you choose to vote in person at the Meeting,
 you must bring the proof of ownership certificate from the TASE&#146;s Clearing
 House member through which the shares are held, indicating that you were the beneficial
 owner of the shares on the record date.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">All Aladdin
 Shares represented by properly executed proxies received by us no later than forty-eight
 (48) hours prior to the Meeting will, unless such proxies have been previously revoked
 or superseded, be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the directions on the
 proxies. If no direction is indicated on the properly executed proxy, the shares
 will be voted in favor of each of the matters described in Items 1, 2 and 3 above.
</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">We know of
 no other matters to be submitted at the Meeting other than as specified herein.
 If any other business is properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named
 as proxies may vote in respect thereof in accordance with their best judgment.</font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">A shareholder
 returning a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to commencement of the Meeting
 by communicating such revocation in writing to us or by executing and delivering
 a later-dated proxy. In addition, any person who has executed a proxy and is present
 at the Meeting may vote in person instead of by proxy, thereby canceling any proxy
 previously given, whether or not written revocation of such proxy has been given.
 Any written notice revoking a proxy should be sent to us at our executive offices
 located at 35 Efal Street, Kiryat Arye, Petach Tikva 49511, Israel, Attention: General

 broker non-votes, is required to approve and adopt the proposals. However, with
 respect to the Merger Proposal (Proposal 1), there is an additional requirement
 for the approval, namely that a majority of the shares that are present and voting
 at the Meeting in person or by proxy will not have voted against the Merger (excluding
 Aladdin Shares held by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any Purchaser Affiliate). Therefore,
 in order for your vote to count towards this special majority on the Merger Proposal
 (Proposal 1), you must not have indicated on the proxy card that you are a Purchaser
 Affiliate. If you so indicate, your vote will not count towards this special majority.</font></p>

 Agreement.</font></p>

 Holder (as defined in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled &#147;The Merger&#150;Material
 Tax Consequences of the Merger&#148; beginning on page 47), the Merger
 will be a taxable transaction to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant
 to which you will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
 between your tax basis in your Aladdin Shares and the amount of cash received.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">20</font></p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">However, the
 U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to each Aladdin shareholder will
 depend on such shareholder&#146;s particular facts and circumstances. If you are
 a U.S. Holder, you are urged to consult your tax advisor as to the particular tax
 consequences of the Merger to you, including the effects of applicable state, local,
 foreign or other tax laws, withholding taxes and possible changes in the tax laws.
 See the section of this Proxy Statement entitled &#147;The Merger&#150;Material

<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Your receipt of cash in exchange for your Aladdin Shares pursuant to the
 Merger Agreement will be a taxable transaction for Israeli tax purposes, unless
 a specific exemption is available under Israeli tax law or unless a double taxation
 prevention treaty between Israel and your country of residence provides otherwise.
 If you are a non-Israeli resident, you may be eligible for an exemption from such
 Israeli tax. You may be subject to the Israeli withholding tax (currently 20% for
 an individual and 25% for a corporation), unless an exemption or relief is provided
 from such withholding tax. You may obtain this exemption by delivering the Tax Declaration
 Form that indicates that you are not an Israeli resident. You should consult your
 tax advisor about the particular tax consequences of the Merger to you. See the

 be effected by the Merger. See the section of this Proxy Statement entitled &#147;The

 the Israeli Commissioner of Restrictive Trade Practices. The filing of an appropriate
 application with the Commissioner and the obtaining of its prior approval is required
 under the Israeli Restrictive Trade Practices Law and has not yet been made. Each
 of the merging parties is required to file a &#147;Merger Notice&#148; with the
 Commissioner in order to receive its prior approval to the Merger. The Commissioner
 is to provide its approval (or conditioned approval) or denial within 30 days of
 submission; however, this period may be extended by the Restrictive Trade Practices
 Tribunal of Israel upon request of the Commissioner, or with the consent of the
 parties upon request of the Commissioner. A non-response within the 30-day period
 after filing the Merger Notice (unless extended) is deemed an approval.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Consummation
 of the Merger is conditioned upon the prior approval of the German Federal Cartel
 Office (Bundeskartellamt). The filing of an appropriate application with the Federal
 Cartel Office and the obtaining of its prior approval are required under the Act
 against Restraints of Competition (ARC). The merging parties must file a &#147;Merger
 Notice&#148; with the Federal Cartel Office in order to receive its prior approval
 to the Merger. Within one month of the submission of a complete filing, the Federal
 Cartel Office is to decide whether to clear the Merger or whether to proceed with
 a second-stage investigation, to be completed within four months of the submission
 of the complete filing; however, this period may be extended, subject to the merging
 parties&#146; agreement. A non-response within the one-month period after the submission
 of the complete filing is deemed an approval. If the Federal Cartel Office has started
 a second-stage investigation, a non-response within the four-month period after
 the submission of the complete filing (unless extended) is deemed an approval. </font></p>

 Requirements</b></font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">In accordance
 with the Companies Law and our Articles of Association, our Board of Directors has
 fixed January 21, 2009 as the record date for determining the shareholders entitled
 to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. Accordingly, you are entitled to notice
 of, and to vote at, the Meeting only if you were a record holder of Aladdin Shares
 at the close of business on that date, irrespective of the amount of Aladdin Shares
 in your possession on such date. As of January 11, 2009, there were 13,936,721 Aladdin
 Shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Your shares may be voted at the Meeting
 only if you are present or your shares are represented by a valid proxy.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">You
 are being asked to vote the shares held directly in your name as a shareholder of
 record and any shares you hold in &#147;street name&#148; as beneficial owner. Shares
 held in &#147;street name&#148; are shares held on your behalf by a bank, a broker
 in a stock brokerage account or a nominee.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">35</font></p>
<page>

<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">The method
 of voting differs for shares held as a record holder and shares held in &#147;street
 name.&#148; Record holders will receive proxy cards. Holders of shares in &#147;street
 name&#148; will receive voting instruction cards in order to instruct their banks,
 brokers or other nominees on how to vote.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Proxy cards and voting instruction
 cards are being solicited on behalf of our Board of Directors from our shareholders
 in favor of the proposals as described in this document.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">You may receive more
 than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this document and
 multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, shareholders who
 hold shares in more than one brokerage account will receive a separate voting instruction
 card for each brokerage account in which shares are held.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Shareholders of record
 whose shares are registered in more than one name will receive more than one proxy

 card you receive.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">A quorum must be present in order for the Meeting to be held.
 At least two shareholders present in person or by proxy, and holding or representing,
 in the aggregate, at least thirty three and one third percent (33.33%) of the voting
 power of our company, will constitute a quorum at the Meeting. Aladdin Shares that
 are voted in person or by proxy &#147;FOR&#148; or &#147;AGAINST&#148; are treated
 as being present at the Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum and are also
 treated as voted at the Meeting with respect to such matters. Abstentions and broker
 non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of
 a quorum for the transaction of business, but such abstentions and broker non-votes
 will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes cast with respect
 to the particular proposal. If within half an hour from the time appointed for the
 holding of the Meeting a quorum is not present, the Meeting will stand adjourned
 until one week thereafter at the same time and place. If within half an hour from
 the time appointed for holding of the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present,
 the persons present will constitute a quorum for the business for which the original
 Meeting was called.</font></p>

 requirement for the approval, namely that a majority of the shares that are present

 Therefore, in order for your vote to count towards this special majority on the
 Merger Proposal (Proposal 1), you must not have indicated on the proxy card that
 you are a Purchaser Affiliate. If you so indicate, your vote will not count towards
 this special majority.</font></p>

 in this Proxy Statement of the Merger is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety
 by reference to, the Merger Agreement, which is the legal document governing the
 Merger. We have attached a copy of the Merger Agreement to this Proxy Statement
 as Appendix A and we recommend that you read it carefully in its entirety.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Background of the Merger</b></font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">We and SafeNet,
 Inc., a portfolio company of Vector, which we also refer to throughout this Proxy
 Statement as SafeNet, have been familiar with each other&#146;s businesses for several
 years. During this period there were intermittent informal contacts between representatives
 of our company and representatives of SafeNet in which preliminary thoughts for
 combination of our and SafeNet&#146;s DRM businesses were discussed. However, neither
 party made any concrete offers regarding a possible business combination of our
 company and SafeNet, a strategic transaction between our company and SafeNet or
 any acquisition of our respective DRM businesses.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">During 2007, our Board of Directors
 held several in-depth strategy discussions following which it adopted a strategic
 growth plan contemplating growth of our company through acquisitions and organic
 growth. Executing upon this plan, we made several acquisitions over the last 12
 months, including our acquisition of Eutronsec S.p.A., which was announced on June
 25, 2008, and our acquisition of the Secure SafeWord product line from Secure Computing
 Corporation, which was announced on July 30, 2008.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On August 7, 2008 Jasmine
 Holdco LLC, an affiliate of Vector, filed a Schedule 13D with the Securities and
 Exchange Commission reporting the acquisition of Aladdin Shares representing approximately
 9% of our outstanding share capital.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">At our request, on August 12, 2008, representatives
 of Vector provided our Board of Directors with a letter describing Vector&#146;s
 interest in consummating a transaction to acquire our company. After our request
 for more specific terms, on August 17, 2008, Vector provided a non-binding proposal
 to acquire our company at a price of $13.00 per share or to have SafeNet purchase
 our DRM business at a price of $125 - $135 million. On August 20, 2008, we issued
 a press release announcing our receipt of Vector&#146;s non-binding proposal.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Following our receipt of the non-binding proposal from Vector, our Board of Directors
 engaged Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, which we also refer to throughout this
 Proxy Statement as Credit Suisse, as a financial advisor and established a special
 Acquisition Committee comprised of Yanki Margalit and David Assia. The Board of
 Directors and the Acquisition Committee began a process, together with our senior
 management, Credit Suisse and U.S. and Israeli legal counsel, to review Vector&#146;s
 non-binding proposal and explore other strategic alternatives. As a result of such
 review, our Board of Directors concluded that, at the time, the non-binding proposal
 presented by Vector undervalued our company and that our company should continue
 to review strategic alternatives to maximize shareholders value. As a result, on
 August 27, 2008, our Board of Directors sent a written response to Vector rejecting
 its proposals. As part of our review of strategic alternatives, the Acquisition
 Committee together with our financial advisor and U.S. and Israeli legal counsel
 considered several alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including, without
 limitation, maintaining our position as an independent company, an acquisition of
 our company by a strategic buyer, a sale of one or more of our business units or
 a minority investment into our company. In furtherance of those alternatives, Credit
 Suisse, members of our Acquisition Committee and our legal counsel held negotiations
 with several potential third parties. However, these negotiations did not materialize
 into any definitive agreements.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">40</font></p>
<page>

<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On August
 28, 2008 Jasmine made a formal request, in accordance with the Israeli Companies
 Law, to convene an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders seeking to,
 among other things, replace all of our directors, other than our "outside directors,"
 so that the new Board of Directors could pursue a sale transaction. Acting upon
 this request, and in compliance with the Israeli Companies Law, on September 18,
 2008 we called an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On September
 20 and 21, 2008, Vector spoke with representatives of Credit Suisse and David Assia,
 following which Vector presented a non-binding offer to purchase our company at
 a price of $14.50 per share, which was subject, among other things, to satisfactory
 completion of due diligence. Vector&#146;s proposal contemplated a process that
 would allow our Board of Directors to have a "go-shop" period following the execution
 of a definitive agreement, with such &#147;go-shop&#148; being conditioned on our
 agreement to enter into an exclusive period of negotiations with Vector. Based on
 this proposal, we entered into an agreement with Jasmine aimed at establishing an
 amicable process for Jasmine to conduct a due diligence review of our company and
 the parties agreed to cancel the pending extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders.
 In connection therewith, we and Vector also agreed to certain mutual standstill
 undertakings.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">During the first several weeks of October 2008, representatives
 of Vector conducted the first stage of their due diligence review. During that time
 frame our legal counsel, Herzog, Fox &#038; Neeman and Kramer, Levin Naftalis &#038;
 Frankel LLP delivered a first draft of a merger agreement to Vector&#146;s counsel.
 Also during that period, we, together with Credit Suisse and legal counsel were
 taking further steps to maximize shareholder value, including actively initiating
 contacts and seeking interest from other potential bidders in order to seek competitive
 offers. These discussions included transactions involving our entire company as
 well as sales of specific business units. However, these efforts did not result
 in any concrete competitive proposals.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On November 4, 2008, representatives of
 Vector presented our Board of Directors with the results of their initial due diligence
 review. Vector&#146;s representatives also informed the Board of Directors that
 they were reducing their non-binding proposal to $13.00 per share and explained
 the reduced price by, among other things, the impact of the global financial crisis
 and certain of Vector&#146;s due diligence findings. Vector&#146;s revised proposal
 continued to be subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence. Our Board of
 Directors evaluated the proposal and received input from our financial and legal
 advisors. Based on the facts that the proposal was subject to continuing due diligence
 and that Vector had not provided its comments to the draft of the Merger Agreement
 it had received weeks before the meeting, our Board of Directors resolved to reject
 the proposal as inadequate and incomplete.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Over the next week, representatives
 of Vector held several discussions with our Israeli legal counsel in which Vector
 indicated its inclination to increase the price for our company to a range of between
 $13.25 per share and $13.75 per share and later to $13.25 per share plus additional
 consideration based on earn out methodologies. Our Board of Directors requested
 that Vector conclude its due diligence review and present a final binding proposal
 after completing negotiations of the form of Merger Agreement we delivered in October
 2008.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">During November and December 2008, representatives of Vector&#160;continued
 their due diligence review, and legal counsel to Aladdin and Vector negotiated the
 Merger Agreement. During that period, the standstill undertakings between the parties
 were extended several times in order to allow the parties to re-evaluate the benefits
 of a business combination in light of changing market and economic conditions.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">In early December 2008, as the global economic crisis deepened, Vector received further
 information regarding our forecast for 2009, including our projected financial performance
 for the quarter ended December 31, 2008. Based on these findings, on December 7,
 2008, representatives of Vector presented our Israeli legal counsel with a new proposal
 at a price of $12.00 per share, which was</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">41</font></p>
<page>

 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">presented as not subject to additional due
 diligence. Later, due to a greater understanding of the factors highlighted above,
 the proposal was subsequently reduced on January 5, 2009 to $11.50 per share, plus
 the value of any Cash (as defined in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled
 &#147;The Merger Agreement&#150;Effect on Share Capital&#150;Ordinary Shares&#148;
 beginning on page 58) on our balance sheet at the closing of the Merger in excess
 of $12,000,000 (subject to certain conditions). Our Board of Directors held several
 meetings to review with assistance of Credit Suisse and our U.S. and Israeli legal
 counsel this proposal and its various elements in light of, among other things,
 management&#146;s revised views regarding our company&#146;s prospects in light
 of the effects of the world economic crisis on our business.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On January
 6, 2009, a news report appeared in <i>The Marker</i>, an Israeli financial publication,
 stating that Aladdin was about to finalize the terms of its acquisition by Vector.
 We issued a press release in which we acknowledged that we continued to conduct
 discussions with Vector regarding a possible strategic transaction.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On January
 8, 2009, representatives of Vectors and SafeNet arrived in Israel to hold discussions
 with key employees of our company and conclude negotiations of the Merger Agreement.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On January 10, 2009, our Board of Directors held a special telephonic meeting
 in which our legal and financial advisors and members of the Acquisition Committee
 updated the Board regarding the status of negotiations with Vector, including regarding
 additional proposals made by Vector related to employee retention. Management discussed
 with the Board of Directors, among other things, its further revised view regarding
 our company&#146;s performance and prospects taking into account additional developments
 of the world economic crisis. Based on the information presented and following discussion
 of the strategic alternatives available to Aladdin, the Board of Directors requested
 members of the Acquisition Committee to continue negotiations with Vector in an
 attempt to conclude all pending matters.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On January 11, 2009, our Board of Directors
 held a special telephonic meeting. Members of our Acquisition Committee and our
 advisors updated the Board of Directors regarding the negotiations with Vector over
 the prior few days and the final terms of the Merger Agreement. Our Board of Directors
 considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
 other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. After discussing the terms
 of the proposed transactions, including the personal interests of certain of our
 officers in the proposed transactions as described in the section of this Proxy
 Statement entitled &#147;The Merger-Interests of our Officers and Directors in the
 Merger&#148; beginning on page 53, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the
 Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger

 a result of the Merger we will be unable to fulfill our obligations to our creditors,
 (d) directed management to call a special meeting of our shareholders and to take
 such other actions as are necessary to complete the Merger and (e) resolved to recommend

 the Israeli Companies Law that codified a company&#146;s ability to provide indemnification
 to officers and directors for expenses incurred in connection with certain kinds
 of governmental investigations in certain circumstances. The proposed amendment
 to our Articles of Association is aimed at conforming the relevant provisions of
 our Articles of Association with these amendments. Accordingly, Article 55, 56 and

 Articles 55, 56 and 58 contained in <i>Appendix C.</i></font></p>

 above, and specifically includes the Merger and the public attempts to influence
 control of our company as identifiable events under such indemnification agreements
 and to update the monetary limit of the undertaking to indemnify under the Indemnification
 Agreements to an aggregate amount for all directors and officers equal to 50% of
 our company&#146;s shareholders equity (or in the case of indemnification related

<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Sale of
 Aladdin Shares</i></font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">The receipt by a U.S. Holder of cash in exchange for Aladdin
 Shares in connection with the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
 income tax purposes. Generally, subject to the discussion below regarding the possible
 status of Aladdin as a passive foreign investment company, for U.S. federal income
 tax purposes, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
 between the amount of cash it receives in connection with the Merger and the aggregate
 adjusted tax basis of the Aladdin Shares that it exchanges therefor. Gain or loss
 will be calculated separately for each block of Aladdin Shares (i.e., shares acquired
 at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. A U.S.
 Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in its Aladdin Shares generally will equal the
 purchase price that it paid for such shares.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Any gain or loss recognized by a
 U.S. Holder should be long-term capital gain or loss if the Aladdin Shares surrendered
 were held for more than one year as of the effective time of the Merger and should
 be short-term capital gain or loss if the Aladdin Shares surrendered were held for
 one year or less as of the effective time of the Merger. In the case of a non-corporate
 U.S. Holder, long-term capital gains are currently subject to a maximum U.S. federal
 income tax rate of 15%. Certain limitations apply to the use of capital losses.
 Any such gain or loss will generally be considered from U.S. sources for U.S. foreign
 tax credit purposes.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Passive Foreign Investment Company</i></font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">The foregoing summary
 assumes that we are not, nor have ever been, a Passive Foreign Investment Company,
 which we refer to throughout this Proxy Statement as a PFIC, for U.S. federal income
 tax purposes. We believe that we were not a PFIC for taxable years prior to 2008
 and based on our projected financial statements which are subject to change, we
 believe that we will not be a PFIC during 2008 or 2009. However, because the determination
 of PFIC status is a factual determination that must be made annually at the close
 of each taxable year, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be a PFIC in
 2008 or 2009. In general, if we were characterized as a PFIC for any taxable year,
 any gain recognized by a U.S. Holder in connection with the Merger would be treated
 as ordinary income and would be subject to tax as if the gain had been realized
 ratably over the holding period of the Aladdin Shares. The amount allocated to the
 current taxable year, or to any year prior to the year in which we became a PFIC,
 would be taxed as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) earned in the current
 taxable year. The amount allocated to other taxable years would be taxed at the
 highest marginal rates applicable to ordinary income for such taxable years, and
 the U.S. Holder also would be liable for interest on such tax liability for such
 years.  <b>U.S. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL
 APPLICATION OF THE PFIC RULES TO THE RECEIPT OF CASH PURSUANT TO THE MERGER.</b></font></p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">U.S. Holders who receive cash in exchange for the termination

 the cash received and the basis of their share options. Payments received by U.S.

 withholding taxes.</font></p>

 certain U.S. Holders of the proceeds of the sale of Aladdin Shares that are made
 pursuant to the transaction within the United States or through certain U.S. related
 financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting and U.S. federal
 backup withholding tax, which currently is imposed at the rate of twenty-eight percent
 (28%). This tax will apply if the U.S. Holder fails to supply a correct taxpayer
 identification number or otherwise fails to comply with applicable U.S. information
 reporting or certification requirements. Any amount withheld from a payment to a
 U.S. Holder under the backup withholding rules is treated as paid to the U.S. Holder
 for purposes of calculating the U.S. Holder&#146;s gain or loss on the transaction,
 but is allowable as a credit against the U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income
 tax liability, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.</font></p>

 Israeli tax considerations in connection with the Merger. The following summary
 is included for general information purposes only, is based upon current Israeli
 tax law and should not be conceived as tax advice to any particular holder of Aladdin
 Shares. No assurance can be given that the analysis made and the views contained
 in this summary as well as the classification of the transaction for Israeli tax
 purposes as set forth below will be upheld by the tax authorities, nor that new
 or future legislation, regulations or interpretations will not significantly change
 the tax considerations described below, and any such change may apply retroactively.
 This summary does not discuss all material aspects of Israeli tax consequences that
 may apply to particular holders of Aladdin Shares in light of their particular circumstances,
 such as investors subject to special tax rules or other investors referred to below.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>HOLDERS OF ALADDIN SHARES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
 PARTICULAR ISRAELI TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER APPLICABLE TO THEM.</b></font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Sale of Aladdin Shares</i></font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">In general, under the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance
 [New Version], 1961 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which
 we also refer to throughout this Proxy Statement as the Tax Ordinance, the disposition
 of shares of an Israeli company is generally deemed to be a sale of capital assets,
 unless such shares are held for the purpose of trading. The Tax Ordinance generally
 imposes a capital gains tax on the sale of capital assets located in Israel, including
 shares in an Israeli resident company, by both residents and non-residents of Israel,
 unless a specific exemption is available or unless a double taxation prevention
 treaty between Israel and the seller&#146;s country of residence provides otherwise.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Under the Tax Ordinance, the tax rate applicable to capital gains derived from
 the disposition of Aladdin Shares in the Merger is generally 20% for Israeli individuals,
 unless such shareholder claims a deduction for financing expenses in connection
 with such shares, in which case the gain will generally be taxed at a rate of 25%.
 Additionally, if such shareholder is considered a &#147;Significant Shareholder&#148; at any time during the 12-month period preceding such disposition, i.e., such
 shareholder holds directly or</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">50</font></p>
<page>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">indirectly,
 including with others, at least 10% of any means of control in our company, the
 tax rate will be 25%. Companies are subject to the corporate tax rate (27% for the
 2008 tax year and 26% for the 2009 tax year) on capital gains derived from the disposition
 of Aladdin Shares, unless such companies were not subject to the Israeli Income
 Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments), 1985 (or certain regulations), prior to August
 2005, in which case the applicable tax rate is 25%. However the foregoing tax rates
 will not apply to: (a) dealers in securities; or (b) shareholders who acquired their
 shares prior to an initial public offering (who may be subject to a different tax
 arrangement).</font></p>
 <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, according to the Tax Ordinance and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
 non-Israeli residents are generally exempt from Israeli capital gains tax on any
 gains derived from the disposition of shares of an Israeli company publicly traded
 on a recognized stock market outside of Israel (such as Aladdin Shares), provided
 that such gains are not derived from a permanent establishment of such shareholders
 in Israel, and further provided that such shareholders did not acquire their shares
 prior to our initial public offering and that such capital gains are not subject
 to the Israeli Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments), 5745-1985 or the rules
 promulgated under section 130A of the Tax Ordinance. However, non-Israeli corporations
 will not be entitled to such exemption if Israeli residents (a) have, directly or
 indirectly, a controlling interest of 25% or more in such non-Israeli corporation
 or (b) are the beneficiaries of or are entitled to 25% or more of the revenues or
 profits of such non-Israeli corporation, whether directly or indirectly.</font>
</p>
 <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">In
 addition, under the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America
 and the Government of the State of Israel with Respect to Taxes on Income, or the
 U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, Israeli capital gains tax generally will not apply to the
 disposition of shares by a U.S. Holder to which the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty applies,
 or a U.S. Treaty Resident, who holds the shares as a capital asset. However, such
 exemption will not apply if (a) the U.S. Treaty Resident holds, directly or indirectly,
 shares representing 10% or more of our voting power during any part of the 12-month
 period preceding the disposition, subject to specified conditions, or (b) the capital
 gains from such disposition can be allocated to a permanent establishment of such
 U.S. Treaty Resident in Israel. Under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, such U.S. Treaty
 Resident would be permitted to claim a credit for Israeli income tax against the
 U.S. federal income tax imposed on the disposition, subject to the limitations in
 U.S. tax laws applicable to foreign tax credits.</font></p>
 <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Generally,
 the sale of the Aladdin Shares may be subject to Israeli withholding tax. However,
 no withholding under the Tax Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli law will

 that it is not an Israeli resident, the form of which is attached as <i>Appendix

 This law provides that capital investments in eligible facilities may be designated

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">additional interests and considered

 the Companies Law, an extraordinary transaction in which an officer or director
 has a personal interest requires the approval of the audit committee and board of
 directors, in that order. Generally, the directors having a personal interest are
 not permitted to participate in the discussion or vote on the matters. However,
 the Companies Law provides that if a majority of the directors has a personal interest
 in a transaction, then all the directors may participate and vote on the transaction
 and the transaction requires shareholder approval. Because of one or more of the
 interests described below, the Articles Amendment and the Indemnification Agreement
 for our directors and officers, as well as the D&#038;O Renewal and the procurement
 of the Run-Off Insurance was brought before our Audit Committee for approval. The
 Merger Proposal requires board and shareholder approval in any event pursuant to
 the provisions of the Companies Law that govern statutory mergers. Under the Companies
 Law, approval of the Indemnification Agreement for our directors and officers, as
 well as the D&#038;O Renewal and the procurement of the Run-Off Insurance requires
 shareholder approval in any event.</font></p>

 entitled &#147;The Merger Agreement&#150;Effect on Share Capital &#150; Share Options,&#148; at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding vested option to purchase
 our ordinary shares will be terminated and cancelled in exchange for the right to
 receive a single lump sum cash payment immediately after the effective time of the
 Merger equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of Aladdin Shares
 subject to such option by the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration
 exceeds the exercise price per share of such option, which we also refer to as the
 Closing Option Payment. In addition, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding
 unvested option to purchase our ordinary shares will be terminated and cancelled
 in exchange for the right to receive cash equal to the Closing Option Payment in
 accordance with the original vesting schedule of each option and will be subject
 to the other terms contained in the grant agreement related to such option. However,
 if the exercise price of any option is equal to or greater than the $11.50, such
 option will be cancelled without any consideration exchanged therefor. As of January
 21, 2009, our directors and officers held, in the aggregate, vested options to purchase
 285,975 Aladdin Shares with weighted average exercise price of $8.51, and unvested
 options to purchase 134,500 Aladdin Shares with weighted average exercise price

Share Options</i>. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding vested option
 to purchase our ordinary shares will be terminated and cancelled in exchange for
 the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment immediately after the effective
 time of the Merger equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of Aladdin
 ordinary shares subject to such option by the amount, if any, by which the Merger
 Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of such option, which we also
 refer to as the Closing Option Payment. In addition, at the effective time of the
 Merger, each outstanding unvested option to purchase our ordinary shares will be
 terminated and cancelled in exchange for the right to receive cash equal to the
 Closing Option Payment in accordance with the original vesting schedule of each
 option and will be subject to the other terms contained in the grant agreement related
 to such option. However, if the exercise price of any option is equal to or greater
 than the $11.50, such option will be cancelled without any consideration exchanged
 therefor. As of the effective time of the Merger, all options to purchase Aladdin
 Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically cease to exist, and
 each holder of such options will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,

 in the number of outstanding Aladdin Shares occurs, including by reason of any stock

 redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transactions,
 the Merger Consideration and any other dependent items will be equitably adjusted

 the signing of the Merger Agreement. While we do not believe that such disclosure
 schedule contains information that applicable securities laws require us to publicly
 disclose (other than information that has already been so disclosed or is disclosed
 in this Proxy Statement), the disclosure schedule does contain information that
 modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties
 set forth in the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations
 and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state
 of facts, since such representations and warranties were made by the parties to
 the Merger Agreement to and solely for the benefit of each other, and they are modified
 in important part by the underlying disclosure schedule. The disclosure schedule
 contains information that has been included in our general prior public disclosures,
 as well as additional nonpublic information. Moreover, information concerning the
 subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the
 date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully
 reflected in our public disclosures or in this Proxy Statement. In addition, certain
 representations and warranties were made as of a specified date, may be subject
 to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable
 to shareholders or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between
 the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.</font></p>
