Attached herewith as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release, dated July 1, 2009,
whereby Acergy S.A. (the "Company") announced that it will release its second
quarter results on Wednesday July 15, 2009. A conference call will be held to
discuss the earnings and review business operations on Wednesday July 15, 2009
at 3:00 pm UK Time.

The attached press release shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section
18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the
liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in
any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set
forth by specific reference in such filing.

Certain statements set forth above and contained in the press release furnished
pursuant to this Form 6-K may include "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use
of words like "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may,"
"plan," "project," "will," "should," "seek," and similar expressions. The
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding
the expected timing of the conference call regarding the Company's second
quarter results and the expected participants of that conference call. The
forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are
subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are
discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results
and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: our ability
to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and
competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship
with significant clients; the outcome of legal proceedings or governmental
enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely
delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion
programs; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including
spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to
control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on
the forward-looking statements.
