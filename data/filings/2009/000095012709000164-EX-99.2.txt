Dear Shareholder,

An Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") of Acergy S.A.
(the "Company") will be held on Tuesday August 4, 2009 at 2.00 p.m. (local time)
at the offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg.

Due to the fact that the Company is incorporated in Luxembourg as a societe
anonyme holding, the Company's affairs are governed by the provisions of
Luxembourg Company Law. Under these provisions and the provisions of the
Company's Articles of Incorporation, an Extraordinary General Meeting relates to
and considers matters of a more formal nature. The matters to be addressed at
the Meeting are restricted to those in the Notice.

It was noted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 22, 2009 that
the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for resolutions 9 and 10
was not present and this meeting was therefore not able to consider these
resolutions.

The Board of Directors therefore decided to call the Meeting to consider
resolutions 9 and 10. At this Meeting there is no requirement for quorum.
However, to approve the proposed resolutions a 2/3rd majority of the votes cast
at the Meeting will be required.

In relation to these two resolutions, our letter of April 2, 2009 to the
Shareholders provided some more clarity as follows:

"Background
The current authorised share capital of the Company is comprised of 230,000,000
common shares. The issued share capital is comprised of 194,953,972 issued
shares as at November 30, 209.

According to the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Luxembourg law, the
existing shareholders have a pre-emptive right to subscribe for new issued
shares. On May 27, 2004 the shareholders provided the Board with an authority
expiring on August 17, 2009 to issue new shares within the limit of the
230,000,000 authorised share capital and not offer such shares to existing
shareholders on a pre-emptive basis.

The maximum number of shares that may be acquired by the Company is determined
by Article 49-2 of the Luxembourg law as 10% of the issued share capital. At
present 12,137,879 shares have been acquired by Acergy S.A. and indirectly by a
wholly-owned subsidiary and these shares are currently retained as treasury
shares. These treasury shares represent 6.23% of the number of issued shares.

Obligation for Acergy to deliver shares
Acergy has - at present - potential obligation to deliver 25,307,333 shares or
approximately 13.0% of the issued share capital. This share obligation
corresponds to:

     a)    20,790,021 shares under the terms of the 2.25% Convertible Bond
           due 2013

     b)    4,517,312 shares under previously approved option schemes.

Convertible Bond obligations and share option exercises can be satisfied by
either issuing new shares or delivering treasury shares.

Proposal for Shareholders Approval

a) Item 9 (authorised share capital)
The Board is seeking shareholder approval to renew - for a further five year
period - the authority for the Board to issue new shares within the limit of the
230,000,000 authorised share capital and not offer such shares to existing
shareholders on a pre-emptive basis. If approved, this would retain the ability
to meet the current obligations under the Convertible Bond and share option
schemes. Renewal of the authority requires a change to the Articles of
Incorporation as laid out in item 9.

b) Item 10 (authority to cancel shares)
The Board is seeking approval to have the flexibility to cancel existing
treasury shares. Furthermore, the Board is also seeking approval to renew - for
a period of one year - its existing authority to extend the share buyback
programme by allowing the Company to acquire a higher number of issued shares
than the number which can be acquired at present.

Note: Under Luxembourg Law, the Company, having bought back 10% of its shares
following an Annual General Meeting of Shareholders authorising such buyback,

                                                                     Page 2 of 3

                                                        [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Acergy

cannot cancel such shares and continue buying back shares without a new
authorisation from its shareholders to buyback shares."

valid for this Meeting and Shareholders of record as of Tuesday March 31, 2009
are entitled to vote at the Meeting. Those Shareholders who have not yet cast
their votes may do so by submitting the enclosed Proxy Card as instructed, or
