 Exhibit 99.1  

  Acergy S.A. Announces Third Quarter Results  London, England – October 14, 2009 – Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock Exchange: ACY), announced today results for the third quarter
which ended on August 31, 2009.  Highlights

•
 
 Adjusted EBITDA(a) margin from continuing operations was 19.7% (Q3 2008: 25.4%)   


•
 
 Income from continuing operations was $65 million (Q3 2008: $101 million)   


•
 
 Strong cash and cash equivalents position of $807 million driven by good operational cashflow   


•
 
 New major contract awards:   


 
•
 
 $260 million four-year contract from Petrobras for use of the Polar Queen   


 
•
 
 $110 million contract offshore Angola for Total and BP   


 
•
 
 SapuraAcergy Joint Venture awarded $170 million contract offshore Australia by Apache, post quarter end  Jean Cahuzac, Chief Executive Officer, said:  “These
results reflect Acergy’s ability to translate excellent operational performance and strong client relationships into a good Group margin. They demonstrate good execution of projects that were awarded in previous years when business conditions
were more favourable.  We expect revenue for 2009 to be in line with guidance although we now expect to outperform on adjusted EBITDA margin, albeit
below 2008 levels.  The underlying market fundamentals remain unchanged and at present challenging conditions prevail in the SURF market. However, the
recently improved visibility for conventional work in West Africa continues and we expect clients to sanction additional projects.  While I continue to
be cautious in the short-term for the SURF market, I remain confident that Acergy is well positioned to manage through the uncertainties of the present market cycle and to capture the expected medium-term upside.”  Financial Summary

 Operating Review  Acergy Northern Europe and Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $216.6 million (Q3 2008: $278.7 million) reflecting lower activity levels, as
anticipated, in an ongoing challenging market environment. Good operational progress was made on Ormen Lange, Dong Nini, Gjoa, Morvin and Deep Panuke, of which the latter remained in early stages. Net operating income from continuing operations for
the quarter was $34.1 million (Q3 2008: $88.3 million), reflecting lower activity levels due to current market conditions despite good operational performance across the project portfolio in this segment. The Marathon Volund Project successfully
completed offshore operations and commercial settlement negotiations continue.  Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from
continuing operations for the third quarter was $43.2 million (Q3 2008: $48.5 million) reflecting good progress on projects, including Bluewater Al Sheehan, BHP Pyrenees and the Pluto Project, which remained in early stages. Net operating loss from
continuing operations was $0.1 million (Q3 2008: net operating income of $6.8 million) due to the one-off cost associated with the dry-docking of the Toisa Proteus relating to hull cleaning. This was partly offset by good project performance
on the Pluto Project and completion of the Bluewater Al Sheehan and Van Gogh Projects. The SapuraAcergy Joint Venture delivered a positive contribution during the quarter.  Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $243.7 million (Q3 2008: $233.4 million) reflecting good progress on a number of projects,
including EPC4A, Block 15, PazFlor and Angola LNG and a good contribution from Sonamet in the quarter. A number of major projects in this segment remain in early stages. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $27.2
million (Q3 2008: $20.7 million) reflecting good project performance across the project portfolio, including Block 15, EPC4A, PazFlor and Sonamet.  Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $13.3 million (Q3 2008: $1.1 million) reflecting the contribution from the offshore installation phase of the
Perdido Project. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $4.1 million (Q3 2008: $0.3 million) primarily due to good progress on the cross-regional Frade Project and the Perdido Project which both completed offshore
operations during the quarter.  Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was
$39.3 million (Q3 2008: $77.3 million) reflecting anticipated lower activity levels partly offset by the three ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras, which achieved full utilisation during the quarter and the contribution from the Frade
Project, which completed its offshore phase. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $6.5 million (Q3 2008: net operating loss of $3.5 million) arising from good performance on all activities.  Discontinued operations  Net income from
discontinued operations for the third quarter was $2.0 million (Q3 2008: $11.7 million) due to the small positive contribution from the Mexilhao Trunkline Project.  Asset Development  The Sonamet Joint Venture remained fully consolidated for the quarter
although it continues to be classified as Assets held for sale on the balance sheet at the quarter end. After the completion of the sale and transfer of shares the business will be deconsolidated from Acergy’s financials and its future results
will be reported as share of results of associates and joint ventures.

 Financial Review  Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $558 million (Q3 2008: $639 million) primarily reflecting lower activity levels in the North Sea and Brazil, as anticipated, partly offset by
good activity levels in West Africa and Asia Pacific.  Gross profit was $116 million (Q3 2008: $186 million) reflecting lower activity levels
and the current portfolio mix with fewer major deepwater projects in installation phase or completed during the quarter, compared to 2008. This was partially offset by good project execution. Vessel utilisation during the quarter remained good.
 Administrative expenses were $56 million (Q3 2008: $64 million) reflecting favourable exchange rate movements and the effect of cost
reduction initiatives.  Acergy’s share of results of associates and joint ventures was $17 million (Q3 2008: $13 million) reflecting
positive contributions from NKT Flexibles, Seaway Heavy Lifting and SapuraAcergy.  The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for
the three months was 19.7% (Q3 2008: 25.4%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 19.3% (Q3 2008: 24.2%).  Other gains were $25 million (Q3 2008: $14 million) reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation primarily on short-term inter-company and cash balances.  Income before taxes from continuing operations for the third quarter was $96 million (Q3 2008: $144 million) reflecting anticipated lower activity levels in the North Sea and Brazil, partly offset by good
operational performance and a good contribution from associates and joint ventures.  Taxation for the quarter was $31 million (Q3 2008: $43
million) reflecting an effective tax rate for the quarter of 32% (Q3 2008: 30%) reflecting the current geographical portfolio mix. The underlying effective tax rate for fiscal year 2009 for the Group is approximately 35%.  Income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $65 million (Q3 2008: $101 million). Net income from total operations for the third quarter was
$67 million (Q3 2008: $113 million).  The cash and cash equivalents position at the quarter end increased to $807 million (Q2 2009: $696
million) due to strong operational cash generation. Deferred revenue, at the quarter end stood at $320 million (Q2 2009: $264 million).  At
quarter end, Acergy S.A. held directly 11,003,758 treasury shares representing 5.64% of the total number of issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares. Total shares
in issue were 194,953,972, including treasury shares.  Backlog  Backlog for continuing operations as at August 31, 2009 was approximately $2.6 billion, of which $0.6 billion is expected to be executed in the remainder of fiscal year 2009. This backlog figure does
not include the backlog relating to associates and joint ventures.

 Trading Outlook  The underlying market fundamentals remain unchanged and the business environment in which we operate remains challenging. Macro economic concerns have resulted in clients continuing to delay the award of
large SURF projects and short-term visibility on this market remains poor.  We continue to see progress in the conventional market in West
Africa and expect further market awards in the coming quarters.  Based on our current view we expect revenue from continuing operations for
fiscal year 2009 to be in line with previous guidance. Subject to the successful outcome of a number of commercial negotiations in the final quarter of fiscal year 2009, we expect to achieve an Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations,
above previous guidance, although below the outturn for fiscal year 2008.  While we continue to build backlog for execution in 2010 and
beyond, we expect that fiscal year 2010 will see lower revenue and particularly, lower margins due to keener competition for recent and new tenders and the resultant pricing pressures.  The medium-term market fundamentals remain strong driven by increasing field depletion, the need to access new reserves and replenish production. We remain confident that our skills and strengths meet our
clients’ strategic needs, particularly in the development of hydrocarbon discoveries secured in challenging acreage. We are well placed, both financially and operationally, to capitalise on asset opportunities should they emerge and to
exploit new growth areas when our markets return to growth.  2009 Pre-Close Trading Update  Acergy S.A. intends to publish its Pre-Close Trading Update for fiscal year 2009 on November 25, 2009.  ************************************************************************************  Acergy S.A. is a seabed-to-surface engineering and construction contractor to the offshore oil and gas industry worldwide. We provide integrated services, and we plan, design and deliver complex projects
in harsh and challenging environments.  ************************************************************************************

 (a) Adjusted EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA
from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted
to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as they
eliminate the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the
Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to
EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the
SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s
operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity. The reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing
operations is included in this release. This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and
impairment charges on property, plant and equipment. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by
companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined
above. Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.  Forward-Looking
Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
statements may be identified by the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,”
“will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the approximate value of the awarded contracts, our anticipated performance for fiscal year 2009, the
underlying market fundamentals, the anticipated conditions of the SURF market in 2010, our expectation of the approval of additional projects in West Africa, our ability to manage our business through this market cycle, the expected reduction of our
shareholdings in two Angolan joint ventures and the expected timing and impact thereof, expectations regarding our backlog and pre-backlog, the expected timing of publishing our pre-close trading update and statements contained in the “Trading
Outlook” section, including the expected awards in and our continued focus on the conventional market in West Africa, the expected activity levels, market conditions and their impact on our margin in 2010, the strength of the medium-term market
fundamentals, our ability to capitalise on asset opportunities, our ability to exploit new growth areas, and statements as to management’s confidence of our ability to meet our clients’ strategic needs and to capture opportunities when the
markets return to growth. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions
and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the
timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control
or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

•
For the three months ended August 31 2009 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible note is to increase the diluted EPS from $0.30 to $0.31 (Q3 2008: decrease from $0.61 to
$0.58). This is said to be anti-dilutive and is therefore not included in the calculation. 


•
For the nine months ended August 31 2009 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible note would be to increase the diluted EPS from $0.92 to $0.93 (Q3 2008: decrease from
$1.15 to $1.14). This is said to be anti-dilutive and is therefore not included in the calculation.
