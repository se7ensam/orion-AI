 Core capital is the sum of shareholders’ equity and the EUR 3 billion in convertible core capital securities from
the Dutch State. 


 2
 The calculation of the IGD (Insurance Group Directive) capital surplus and ratio have been changed and are based on
Solvency I capital requirements on IFRS for entities within the EU, and local regulatory solvency measurements for non-EU entities. Specifically, required capital for the life insurance companies in the US is calculated as two times the upper end of
the Company Action Level range (200%) as applied by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the US.
