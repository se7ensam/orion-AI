pursuant to this Form 6-K may include "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use

and Deputy Chairman of the Board. The forward-looking statements reflect our
current views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The
following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and
submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those
that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially from
our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant
projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and
businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the
outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries;
uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of
ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programs; the impact
of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and
environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or
predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements.

Dear Shareholder,

The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Acergy S.A. (the "Company") will
be held on Friday May 22, 2009 at 2 p.m. (local time) at the offices of Services
Generaux de Gestion S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg.

Due to the fact that the Company is incorporated in Luxembourg as a societe
anonyme holding, our affairs are governed by the provisions of the Luxembourg
Company Law. Under these provisions and the provisions of the Company's Articles
of Incorporation, the Annual General Meeting relates to and considers matters of
a more formal nature, including the affairs of the Company on an unconsolidated
and consolidated basis. The matters to be addressed at the Annual General
Meeting are restricted to those in the Notice.

I would draw your attention to item 9 (authorised share capital) and item 10
(cancellation of treasury shares) in the Notice so as to provide more clarity on
these issues.

Background

The current authorised share capital of the Company is comprised of 230,000,000
common shares. The issued share capital is comprised of 194,953,972 issued
shares as at November 30, 2008.

According to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, the existing shareholders
have a pre-emptive right to subscribe for new issued shares. On May 27, 2004 the
shareholders provided the Board with an authority expiring on August 17, 2009 to
issue new shares within the limit of the 230,000,000 authorised share capital
and not offer such shares to existing shareholders on a pre-emptive basis.

The maximum number of shares that may be acquired by the Company is determined
by Article 49-2 of the Luxembourg law as 10% of the issued share capital. At
present, 12,137,879 shares have been acquired by Acergy S.A. and indirectly by a
wholly-owned subsidiary and these shares are currently retained as treasury
shares. These treasury shares represent 6.23% of the number of issued shares.

Obligation for Acergy to deliver shares

Acergy has - at present - potential obligation to deliver 25,307,333 shares or
approximately 13.0% of the issued share capital. This share obligation
corresponds to:

     a) 20,790,021 shares under the terms of the 2.25% Convertible Bond due 2013

                                                        [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Acergy

     b) 4,517,312 under previously approved option schemes.

Convertible Bond obligations and share option exercises can be satisfied by
either issuing new shares or delivering treasury shares.

Proposal for shareholders approval

a) Item 9 (authorised share capital)
The Board is seeking shareholder approval to renew - for a further five year
period - the authority for the Board to issue new shares within the limit of the
230,000,000 authorised share capital and not offer such shares to existing
shareholders on a pre-emptive basis. If approved, this would retain the ability
to meet the current obligations under the Convertible Bond and share option
schemes. Renewal of the authority requires a change to the Articles of
Incorporation as laid out in Item 9.

b) Item 10 (authority to cancel shares)
The Board is seeking approval to have the flexibility to cancel existing
treasury shares. Furthermore, the Board is also seeking approval to renew - for
a period of one year - its existing authority to buyback up to 10% of the issued
share capital. This would give the Board flexibility to extend the share buyback
programme by allowing the Company to acquire a higher number of issued shares
than the number which can be acquired at present.

Note: Under Luxembourg Law, the Company, having bought back 10% of its shares
following an Annual General Meeting of Shareholders authorising such buyback,
cannot cancel such shares and continue buying back shares without a new
authorisation from its shareholders to buyback shares.

Quorum and Majority

With the exception of items 9 and 10, there is no quorum requirement for the
agenda items of the 2009 Annual General Meeting. The agenda items, other than
items 9 and 10, are adopted by a simple majority of the shares presented or
represented. However a quorum of 50% of the outstanding share capital is
required for the purposes of agenda items 9 and 10. These items may be adopted
by a majority of 2/3rds of the shares present or represented and validly voting.
In the event the quorum is not reached at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, a
second meeting via an Extraordinary General Meeting may be convened to consider
the items. At such a meeting there is no requirement for a quorum.

General Matters

Enclosed with this mailing is the Notice of Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders, including unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements,
the Report of the Board of Directors and the Independent Auditor's Reports, as
well as Proxy Card relating thereto. Shareholders of record at the close of
business on March 31, 2009, will be entitled to vote at the Annual General
Meeting.

If you wish your Shares to be voted at the Annual General Meeting, please
promptly sign, date and return the enclosed Proxy Card to assure that they will
be received in time.

If you require further information or clarification on any issues please contact
our General Counsel at johan.rasmussen@acergy-group.com.

The Company's Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favour of the
proposals to be considered at the meeting.

Yours sincerely


Mark Woolveridge
Chairman

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Report on the annual accounts

Following our appointment by the General Meeting of Shareholders dated 23 May
2008, we have audited the accompanying annual accounts of Acergy S.A., which
comprise the balance sheet as at 30 November 2008, and the income statement,
statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended,
and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

Board of Directors' responsibility for the annual accounts

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of these annual accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union. This responsibility includes:
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of annual accounts that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate
accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the
circumstances.

Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing as adopted by the Institut des reviseurs d'entreprises. Those standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance whether the annual accounts are free from
material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts. The procedures selected depend
on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
entity's preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal control.

                                                        Member of
Audit.Tax.Consulting.Financial Advisory.                Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu

Deloitte

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of
Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual
accounts. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the financial
position of Acergy S.A. as of 30 November 2008, and of its financial performance
and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

The annual management report, which is the responsibility of the Board of
Directors, is consistent with the annual accounts.

1.   Organisation

     Acergy S.A. ("the Company") is a holding company incorporated under the
     laws of Luxembourg on 10 March 1993. The Company has been incorporated for
     an unlimited period of time.

     The object of the Company is to invest in subsidiaries which will provide
     technologically sophisticated offshore and subsea engineering, flow line,
     trunk line and pipeline lay, construction, inspection and maintenance
     services, predominantly for the offshore oil and gas industry. More
     generally, the Company may invest in any manner in all commercial,
     industrial, financial and other enterprises of Luxembourg or foreign
     nationality through the acquisition by participation, subscription,
     purchase, option or any other means of all shares, stocks, debentures,
     bonds or securities; the acquisition of patents and licenses it will
     administer and exploit; it may lend or borrow with or without security,
     provided that any monies so borrowed may only be used for the purpose of
     the Company, or companies which are subsidiaries of or associated with or
     affiliated to the Company; in general it may undertake any operations
     directly or indirectly connected with these objects whilst nevertheless
     remaining within the limits set out by the law on holding companies within
     the Law of 31 July 1929 governing holding companies which fiscal regime is
     maintained for a transitional period until 31 December 2010 according to
     conditions defined by the Law of 22 December 2006 amending the Law of 31
     July 1929.

     The Company also prepares consolidated financial statements in conformity
     with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
     Union. Copies of these financial statements are available at the registered
     office of the Company.

     The Company is reimbursed by its subsidiaries for certain general expenses
     incurred on behalf of the subsidiaries.

     Statement of Going Concern

     The Company's business activities, together with the factors likely to
     affect its future development, performance and position are set out above.
     The financial position of the Company, its liquidity position and borrowing
     facilities are set out in the financial statements.

     The Company has adequate financial resources. As a consequence, the
     Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business
     risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.

     The Directors have reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate
     resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
     Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
     the accounts.

2.   Adoption of new accounting standards

     This is the first year in which the Company has prepared its financial
     statements under International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as
     issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and as
     adopted by the European Union, and the comparatives have been restated from
     the Luxembourg Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("Lux GAAP") to
     comply with IFRS. The reconciliations to IFRS from previously published Lux
     GAAP financial statements are set forth in Note 21 'Explanation of
     transition to IFRS'.

     The adoption of IFRS does not change the Company's underlying performance,
     strategy, and risk management.

                                                                               8

2.   Adoption of new accounting standards (continued)

     First time applications of IFRS

     IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,
     provides for the retrospective application of standards, with the exception
     of certain obligatory provisions and some limited exemptions.

     The Company has elected to utilise the following exemptions:

     Share-Based Payment Transactions

     The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, in respect of
     share options granted since 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1
     December 2006.

     Future accounting standards

     At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following
     standards and interpretations that have not been applied in these financial
     statements were in issue but not yet effective:

<TABLE>

     <S>               <C>                                       <C>

     IFRIC 17          Distribution of Non-cash Assets to        1 December 2008
                       Owners
</TABLE>

     The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and
     interpretations in the future periods will not have a material impact on
     the financial statements of the Company.

3.   Summary of significant accounting policies

     The Company maintains its books and records in U. S. Dollars, and presents
     its annual accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting
     Standards as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the European Union. They
     comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The transition date for
     adoption of IFRS was 1 December 2006.

     The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below:

     3.1  Format of financial statements

          In accordance with IAS 1 and Article 26 of the law of 19 December,
          2002 as amended, the financial statements are presented with certain
          modifications to the general legal format requirements. In the opinion
          of the Directors, this is necessary in order to present the financial
          position and results of the Company to the reader with the utmost
          clarity.

     3.2  Revenue recognition

          Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
          receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services
          provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales
          related taxes.

          Revenue relates to the provision of parent company guarantees
          collected on its behalf by an affiliated company Acergy Treasury
          Limited, based in England.

                                                                               9

     3.3  Investments

          Investments are stated at cost less any permanent impairment in value.
          IAS1 and Article 51(e) of the Law of 19 December, 2002 foresees that
          assets and liabilities are to be valued on an individual basis. Since
          all group companies are closely related to each other and any
          impairment review has to be performed on a portfolio basis instead of
          on an individual investment basis, any permanent impairments of the
          cost of the portfolio would lead to value adjustments. Earnings in
          investee companies are recognized when, and to the extent, dividends
          are received from investee companies.

     3.4  Translation of foreign currencies

          The financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, which is the
          Group's reporting currency.

          Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
          functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
          Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
          retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
          All differences are taken to net income or loss. Non monetary items
          that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency
          are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial
          transactions. Non monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign
          currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the
          fair value is determined.

     3.5  Share based payments

          Certain Directors of the Company receive part of their remuneration in
          the form of share options.

          Equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date on
          which they are granted. The fair value is determined using a
          Black-Scholes model. The cost of equity-settled transactions is
          recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the
          period in which the performance and/or service conditions are
          fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become
          fully entitled to the award ('the vesting date').

          The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at
          each balance sheet date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent
          to which the vesting period has expired and the Company's best
          estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately
          vest. The cumulative expense also includes the estimated future charge
          to be borne by the employer entity in respect of social security or
          national insurance contributions, based on the intrinsic unrealised
          value of the stock option using the stock price on the balance sheet
          date. The net income or loss charge or credit for a period represents
          the difference in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning
          and end of that period.

          Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees
          of subsidiaries which are to be equity-settled, the Company records an
          increase in the cost of investment and a corresponding entry in equity
          of an amount equal to the expense recognised in the subsidiary.

     3.6  Convertible loan notes

          The component of the convertible notes issued by the Company that
          exhibits characteristics of a liability is recognised as a liability
          in the balance sheet, net of transaction costs. On issuance of the
          convertible notes, the fair value of the liability component is
          determired using a market rate for an equivalent non convertible note;
          and this amount is classified as a financial liability measured at
          amortised cost until it is extinguished on conversion or redemption.

          The fair value of the instrument, which is generally the net proceeds,
          less the fair value of the liability, is allocated to the conversion
          option which is recognised and included in shareholders' equity, net
          of transaction costs. The carrying amount of the conversion option is
          not measured again in subsequent years.

                                                                              10

3.   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

     3.6  Convertible loan notes (continued)

          Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity
          components of the convertible notes based on the allocation of
          proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments
          are first recognised.

     3.7  Own shares

          Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares) are
          deducted from equity at cost. No gains or losses are recognised in the
          income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the
          Company's own equity instruments.

     3.8  Financial instruments

          A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial
          asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of
          another entity.

          Financial assets are classified into the following specified
          categories: financial assets at 'fair value through the profit or
          loss' (FVTPL), 'held to maturity' investments, 'available for sale'
          (AFS) financial assets and 'loans and receivables'. The classification
          depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is
          determined at the time of initial recognition.

          Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified as either
          FVTPL or 'other financial liabilities' according to the substance of
          the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any
          contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group
          after deducting all of its liabilities and is recorded at the proceeds
          received, net of direct issue costs.

     3.9  Financial guarantee liabilities

          Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Group are those
          contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder
          for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor (generally an
          associate or joint venture of the Group), fails to fulfil a commitment
          when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

          Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability
          at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly
          attributable to the issue of the guarantee. Subsequently, the
          liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the
          expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance
          sheet date and the amount initially recognised.

4.   Loss for the year

     Loss for the year has been arrived at after charging/ (crediting):

     As at 30 November 2008 an impairment loss amounting to USD37.0 million has
     been recognised in respect of the investment in Jarius Investments Limited.
     The impairment is necessary as the Directors believe that the short term
     recovery of certain intercompany debts of Janus Investments Limited is
     doubtful and have therefore reduced the net asset value of this subsidiary
     company. The Directors are confident that these debts are recoverable in
     the long term.

12.  Convertible loan notes

     On 11 October 2006 the Company issued a $500.0 million 2.25% convertible
     note due 2013. The issuance was completed on 11 October 2006 with the
     receipt of net proceeds after deduction of issuance related costs of $490.8
     million. The issuance costs of $9.2 million have been split between the
     liability and equity components.

     The convertible notes have an annual interest rate of 2.25% payable
     semi-annually in arrears on April 11 and October 11 of each year up to and
     including fiscal year 2013. They were issued at 100% of their principal
     amount and unless previously redeemed, converted or cancelled will mature
     on 11 October 2013. The convertible notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market
     of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

     The noteholders were granted an option which allows them to convert the
     convertible notes into common shares with an initial conversion price of
     $24.05 equivalent to 20,790,021 common shares, or approximately 10.7% of
     our existing issued share capital at the date of issue. This was
     subsequently revised to $23.52 following the payment of the dividends since
     issuance. The conversion price will continue to be adjusted in line with
     market practices for this type of instrument to provide 'anti-dilutive'
     adjustments for items such as payment of dividends and events such as a
     change of control which can affect materially the marketability, liquidity
     or volatility of common shares.

     There is also an option for the Company to call the convertible notes after
     four years and 14 days from the date of issue if the price of the common
     shares exceeds 130% of the then prevailing conversion price over the above
     specified period.

     The following undertakings apply:

     o    unsecured but with a negative pledge provision in respect of other
          current and future debt to ensure that the convertible notes will rank
          equally with other debt issuance;

     o    a cross default provision subject to a minimum threshold of $10.0
          million and other events of default in connection with non-payment of
          the convertible notes;

     o    various undertakings in connection with the term of any further
          issuance of common shares, continuance of the listing of the shares
          and the convertible notes on recognised stock exchanges; and

     o    provisions for the adjustment of the conversion price in certain
          circumstances.

     There were no conversions of these convertible notes as of 30 November
     2008.

                                                                              14

     The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible loan notes have

     The liability component is as follows:

     Liability component at 30 November        397,322       380,310
                                             =========     =========

     The interest charged in the year is calculated by applying an effective
     rate of 7.35%. The liability component is measured at amortised cost. The
     difference between the carrying amount of the liability component at the
     date of issue and the amount reported in the balance sheet at 30 November
     2008 represents the effective interest rate less interest paid to that
     date.

     The Directors estimate the fair value of the liability component of the
     convertible loan notes at 30 November 2008 to be approximately $397.3
     million (2007: $380.3 million).

                                                                              15

15.  Own shares

     On 11 September 2006 the commencement of a share buyback program was
     announced, which allowed for the purchase of up to a maximum of 10% of our
     issued share capital, pursuant to an extension to the standing
     authorisation granted to the Board at the Annual General Meeting held on 22
     May 2007.

     The share buyback program was completed during fiscal year 2008. A total of
     15.4 million shares for a total consideration of $301.6 million were
     repurchased. These were open market repurchases on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
     The buy back of issued share capital reduces the distributable reserves.

                                                                              16

     Paid in surplus

     The directors propose that a dividend of $0.22 per share will be paid to
     shareholders in June 2009. This dividend is subject to approval by
     shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a
     liability in these consolidated financial statements. The total estimated
     dividend to be paid is $40.2 million.

     Equity reserve

     This reserve represents the equity component of the convertible loan notes.
     (Refer to Note 12 'Convertible loan notes')

     Legal reserve

     Under Luxembourg law an amount equal to at least 5% of the annual income
     must be appropriated to a legal reserve until such reserve equals 10% of
     the issued share capital. This reserve is not available for dividend
     distribution. The legal reserve may also be satisfied by allocation of the
     required amount at the time of issuance of shares or by a transfer from
     share premium.

     The legal reserve for all outstanding Common Shares has been satisfied and
     appropriate allocations are made Co the legal reserve account at the time
     of issuance of new shares.

     Dividends

     On 23 May 2008 a dividend of $0.21 per share (total dividend $.38.5
     million) was declared for shareholders of record on 29 May 2008.

17.  Share based payments

     Equity-settled share option plan

     The Group operates a share option plan which was approved in April 2003
     (the '2003 Plan'). This plan includes an additional option plan for key
     directors and employees' resident in France (the 'French Plan') as a
     sub-plan, and additional options which are granted under the Serior
     Management Incentive Plan (SMIP).

     A Compensation Committee appointed by the Board of Directors administers
     these plans. Options are awarded at the discretion of the Compensation
     Committee to directors and key employees.

     Under the 2003 Plan options up to but not exceeding 6.3 million common
     shares can be granted. Following shareholder approval at the Extraordinary
     General Meeting held on 18 December 2008, the 2003 Plan was expanded to
     cover up to 8,710,000 shares. This plan replaced the previous plan (the
     '1993 Plan'). Any options granted under the French Plan count against this
     limit. Other than options granted under the SMIP, options under the 2003
     Plan (and therefore also under the French Plan) may be granted, exercisable
     for periods of up to ten years at an exercise price not less than the fair
     market value per share at the time the option is granted. Such options vest
     25% on the first anniversary of the grant date, with an additional 25%
     vesting on each subsequent anniversary. The cost of these non-performance
     share options are therefore recognised using the graded vesting attribution
     method. Share options exercises are satisfied by either issuing new shares
     or reissuing treasury shares. Furthermore, options are generally forfeited
     if the option holder leaves the Group under any circumstances other than
     due to the option holder's death, disability or retirement before his or
     her options are exercised.

     In fiscal year 2008 1,052,500 common shares (2007: 52,000 common shares)
     were granted, which included 234,000 options (2007: 22,000 options) granted
     under the French plan. These options were granted subject to shareholder
     approval which was obtained at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on
     December 18, 2008.

     Restricted share plan

     During fiscal year 2008 the Group introduced a restricted share plan to
     provide a retention incentive to selected senior executives. The number of
     shares that maybe awarded under the plan may not exceed an average of
     350,000 common shares over a three year period. During the three year
     restricted period plan participants are not permitted to sell or transfer
     shares but will be entitled to dividends which will be held by the Group
     until the restricted period lapses.

     In fiscal year 2008, 65,000 restricted shares were issued at a weighted
     average price and fair value of $22.23 being the market price on the date
     of issue.

                                                                              18

     Executive deferred incentive scheme

     During fiscal year 2008 the Group introduced a deferred incentive scheme
     for selected senior executives. The scheme enabled the executives to defer,
     on a voluntary basis, up to 50% of their annual bonus into shares of the
     Group which will be matched in shares at the end of three years subject to
     performance conditions. The amount of the bonus deferred was used to
     purchase 17,797 shares based upon the prevailing share price on 31 March
     2008 which was $21.35. The matched element is conditional upon the growth
     of earnings per share over the three years to 30 November 2010.

     Option activity including the SMIP, are as follows:

     Expected dividends (in $)                        0.21             -

     The expected life of an option is determined by taking into consideration
     the vesting period of options, the observed historical pattern of share
     option exercises, the effect of non-transferability and exercise
     restrictions. The expected volatility over the expected term of the options
     is estimated from our historical volatility. For fiscal year 2008 the
     expected dividend takes into account the expected dividends over the four
     year vesting period assuming a growth rate of 5% over the $0.21 cent
     dividend declared during the year. For fiscal year 2007 the expected
     dividends was $nil cents as a historical pattern of dividends payments had
     not been established at the grant dates and it was the first time the
     Company had paid a dividend of $0.20.

                                                                              19

18.  Commitments and guarantees

     We arrange for bank guarantees, which collectively refer to bank
     guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds, advance payment bonds, guarantees
     or standby letters of credit in respect of our performance obligation to be
     provided to our clients in connection with our work on specific projects.

     Facilities

     The following facilities, held by affiliated undertakings, were guaranteed
     by the Company as at 30 November 2008:

     The $400 million amended and restated revolving credit and guarantee
     facility

     The $400 million amended and restated revolving credit and guarantee
     facility, as amended on 10 August 2006 has a maturity of 10 August 2011.

     The sub-limit for cash drawings is $100 million.

     The facility is used for general corporate purposes including the financing
     of ships and includes the issuance of guarantees to support contract
     performance obligations and other operating requirements. It provides for
     revolving loans of up to $ 100 million during the first three years,
     reducing to $75 million for the fourth year and further reducing to $50
     million for the fifth year until the final date of maturity of 10 August
     2011.

                                                                              20

18.  Commitments and guarantees (continued)

     Any unused amount under the revolving loan part of the facility is
     available for the issuance of guarantees. Borrowings under this facility
     may be made in minimum increments of $5.0 million subject to the
     satisfaction of certain legal customary conditions. Additionally under this
     facility performance guarantees can be issued with a maturity no later than
     10 February 2013.

     The unutilised portion of the cash loan facility was available for
     guarantees.

     Interest on the facility is payable at L1BOR plus a margin which is linked
     to the ratio of the Group's net debt to EBITDA and which may range from
     0.8% to 1.9% per year. The margin is currently fixed at 0.8% for a period
     of three months and is reviewed every three months. The fee applicable for
     performance guarantees is linked to the same ratio of net debt to EBITDA
     and may range from 0.4% to 0.95% per year and is currently fixed at 0.4%.

     The $200 million guarantee facility

     On 26 February 2008, an affiliated undertaking executed a new $200 million
     multi-currency revolving guarantee facility with a number of banks from the
     existing consortium that provided the $400 million revolving credit and
     guarantee facility.

     This facility is to be used for the issuance of performance guarantees in
     the ordinary course of the Group's business. The facility has a maturity
     date of 26 February 2013 however, performance guarantees can be issued with
     a maturity no later than 26 August 2014.

     The fee applicable for performance guarantees is linked to the ratio of net
     debt to EBITDA and may range from 0.45% to 1.00% per year and is currently
     fixed at 0.45% subject to review every three months.

     Both the facilities contain certain financial covenants in respect of a
     minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum level of net debt to
     earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA'),
     a maximum level of total financial debt to tangible net worth, a minimum
     level of cash and cash equivalents and an interest cover covenant. The
     requirements of the financial covenants must be met on a consolidated basis
     at quarterly intervals ending 28 February, 31 May, 31 August and 30
     November of each year. In addition to the financial covenants listed above,
     the facilities also contain negative pledges with respect to accounts
     receivable and cash and include representations, affirmative covenants and
     negative covenants and events of defaults which are customary for
     transactions of this nature and consistent with past practice. Such
     covenants specifically limit mergers or transfers, incurrence of other
     indebtedness, investments and loans, distributions to shareholders and cash
     and cash equivalents that are permitted to be held by non-obligors.

20.  Tax

     The Company has elected to be taxed as a billionaire holding company and is
     subject to a variable tax rate, calculated annually with half-yearly
     advance payments, which is based on certain interest expense, dividends and
     certain compensation paid to non-resident directors during the period. The
     tax is calculated as follows:

     Where the total interest paid each year to bondholders and on other
     comparable securities amounts to or exceeds (euro)2,400,000:

     o    3% on interests paid to bond and other security - holders;

     o    1.8% on dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to non-resident
          directors on the first (euro)1,200,000;

     o    0.1% on any surplus dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to
          non-resident directors.

     Where the total interest paid each year to bondholders and on other
     comparable securities is less than (euro)2,400,000:

     o    3% on interests paid to bond and other security - holders;

     o    3% on dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to non-resident
          directors, but to a maximum amount corresponding to the difference
          between (euro)2,400,000 and the total interest paid to bondholders and
          on other comparable negotiable securities;

     o    1.8% on any surplus dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to
          non-resident directors up to (euro)1,200,000 distributed;

     o    0.1% on surplus dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to
          non-resident directors.

     Billionaire holding companies are subject to a minimum annual charge of
     (euro)48,000. The tax election made cannot be reversed; in other words,
     billionaire holding companies cannot elect different tax treatment from one
     year to the next.

     For the years ended 30 November 2008 and 2007 this tax amounted to $351,000
     and $361,000 respectively, and is included in other charges in the
     accompanying statements of profit and loss.

     As per Note 1 the Company must remain within the limits set out by the Law
     of 31 July 1929 governing holding companies which fiscal regime is
     maintained for a transitional period until 31 December 2010 according to
     conditions defined by the Law of 22 December 2006 amending the Law of 31
     July 1929.

                                                                              22

21.  Explanation of transition to IFRS

     This is the first year that the Company is presenting its financial
     statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The
     following disclosures are required in the year of transition. The last
     financial statements under Lux GAAP were for the year ended 30 November
     2007 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 December 2006.

     Accordingly the Company has prepared financial statements which comply with
     IFRS applicable from periods beginning on or after 1 December 2006, and
     significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 3. The analysis below
     includes a reconciliation of net assets and income as reported under Lux
     GAAP as at 30 November 2007 to the revised net assets and income under IFRS
     as reported in these financial statements (refer to column 'IFRS 2007'). In
     addition, there is a reconciliation of net assets under Lux GAAP to IFRS as
     at the IFRS transition of 1 December 2006 (refer to column 'IFRS 2006').

Year ended 30 November 2008

21.  Explanation of transition to IFRS (continued)

     (a)  Share based payments

     Under IFRS equity based transactions are charged to paid in surplus hence
     an associated decrease in provisions and an increase in paid in surplus.

     (b)  Convertible notes

     IFRS requires separate valuation of the equity option associated with
     convertible notes. The effect of this adjustment is a decrease in
     borrowings of $119.7 million at 30 November 2007 (2006: $135.5 million)
     with a corresponding after-tax increase in shareholders' equity at 30
     November 2007 of $94.3 million (2006: $108.8 million). Reported borrowing
     costs for the year ended 30 November 2007 increase by $14.5 million in
     respect of the amortisation of the discount.

     (c)  Own shares

     Under Lux GAAP Treasury shares are shown on the face of the balance sheet
     as an asset and a corresponding Treasury stock reserve is recognised. Under
     IFRS Treasury shares are disclosed within shareholders equity and there is
     no requirement to recognise a Treasury reserve.

     Under Lux GAAP losses on the resale of Treasury shares were charged to the
     profit and loss account in the year they were incurred. Under IFRS these
     losses are charged directly to equity.

     (d)  Financial instruments

     IFRS requires the fair valuation of financial guarantees (refer note 18).
     The effect of this adjustment is an increase in other payables of $3.136
     million and a corresponding adjustment in retained losses as at 1 December
     2006.

     Significant accounting policies

     Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted,
     including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the
     basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class
     of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed
     in Note 3 'Significant accounting policies'.

     Financial risk management objectives

     An affiliated group treasury company, provides services to the business,
     co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets,
     monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the
     Company through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and
     magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (consisting of currency
     risk and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

     The treasury company seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using
     financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The use of financial
     instruments is governed by the Company's policies approved by the Board of
     Directors, which provide written policies on foreign exchange risk,
     interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of non-derivative financial
     instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.

     Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous
     basis and the treasury company function reports monthly to senior
     management. The Company does not enter into or trade financial instruments
     for speculative purposes.

     Market risk

     The Company has limited exposure to the financial risks of changes in
     foreign currency exchange rates (see below) but has exposure to the
     financial risks of changes in interest rates (see below).

     There has been no change to the Company's exposure to market risks or the
     manner in which it manages and measures the risk.

     Foreign currency risk management

     The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and undertakes the
     majority of its transactions in the US dollar. The Company therefore has
     minimal exposure to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency
     exchange rates.

     Interest rate risk management

     The Company places surplus funds on the money markets to generate an
     investment return for short durations only, ensuring a high level of
     liquidity and reducing the credit risk associated with the deposits.
     Changes in the interest rates associated with these deposits will impact
     the return generated.

     The Company's exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial
     liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this
     Note.

                                                                              27

     Credit risk management

     Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its
     contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company. The
     Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy
     counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a
     means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

     The Company only invests with entities that are rated the equivalent of
     investment grade and above. This information is supplied by independent
     rating agencies. The Company's exposure and the credit ratings of its
     counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of
     transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Credit
     exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and
     approved by the risk management committee annually. In respect of its
     clients and suppliers the Company uses credit ratings as well as other
     publicly available financial information and its own trading records to
     rate its major counterparties.

     The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is
     limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings
     assigned by international credit-raring agencies.

     The table below shows the carrying amount of our major counterparties
     (depositors) at the balance sheet date using the Standard and Poor's credit
     rating symbols.

     Liquidity risk management

     Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board
     of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management
     framework for the management of the Company's short, medium and long-term
     funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages
     liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and
     reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and
     actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets
     and liabilities.

     Liquidity and interest risk tables

     The following tables detail the Company's remaining contractual maturity
     for its non-derivative financial liabilities.

     The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of
     financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Company can
     be required to pay. The table consists of the principal cash flows:

     Fair value of financial instruments

     The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are
     determined as follows:

     o    the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with
          standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets is
          determined with reference to quoted market prices;

     o    the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities
          (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in accordance with
          generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow
          analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and
          dealer quotes for similar instruments;

     o    the fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted
          prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted
          cash flow analysis using, the applicable yield curve for the duration
          of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing
          models for optional derivatives;

     o    the fair value of financial guarantee contracts is determined using
          option pricing models where the main assumptions are the probability
          of default by the specified counterparty extrapolated from
          market-based credit information and the amount of loss, given the
          default.

     Except as detailed in the following table, the carrying amounts of
     financial assets and financial liabilities as indicated recorded at
     amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values:

Notes to the annual accounts
Year ended 30 November 2008

24.  Related parties (continued)

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 share options were exercised
     by one member of the key management personnel. An affiliated group company
     paid USD 0.3 million of payroll taxes associated with this exercise which
     were subsequently reimbursed on 1 December 2008. The amount is therefore
     considered to be a loan to a related party as at 30 November 2008.

25.  Subsequent events

     On 12 February 2009, the Board resolved to recommend a dividend per common
     share of 22 cents (2007: 21 cents), subject to shareholder approval at the
     Annual General Meeting.

in the oil and gas industry.

The Board will consider the proposal, at its meeting on April 9, 2009, that Sir
Peter Mason be elected Chairman and Mr Tom Ehret be elected Deputy Chairman,
both with effect from the closing of the AGM on May 22, 2009, subject to them
