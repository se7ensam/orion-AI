AGNICO-EAGLE PROVIDES
EXPLORATION UPDATE;

SIGNIFICANT NEW
INTERSECTIONS AT KITTILA;

POSTIVE DEVELOPMENTS FOR
SINTER AND CUBIRO ZONES AT PINOS ALTOS

 

Toronto (November 30,
2009) - Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited
(“Agnico-Eagle” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide an update on its
exploration program since its last exploration results news release on September 08,
2009.

 

The Company’s exploration
programs in 2009 continue to increase the known size of the mineralized
envelopes of several deposits, over and above the amount mined during the
year.  This $54 million exploration
program was expected to result in approximately 221 kilometres of drilling
using more than 35 rigs.  However, due to
exploration success, the budget was increased approximately 10% and
approximately 265 kilometres of exploration drilling has been completed through
October 2009.

 

Highlights of the recent exploration program include:

 

·                  At Kittila:

 

·                  Gold intersections in the Suuri
and Roura zones suggest that they are one continuous zone at depth with a
potential strike length of approximately 500 metres

·                  Discovery of the new high grade
Roura East lens

·                  Ketola zone continues at depth,
approximately 75 metres beneath the current resource model

 

·                  At Pinos Altos:

 

·                  Continued positive drill
results at the Sinter zone.  First
mineral resource and feasibility study expected in 2010.  Stand-alone open pit and heap leach operation

·                  Encouraging results add to
definition of recently-discovered Cubiro gold-silver zone.  Further drilling underway

 

·                  In the Abitibi:

 

·                  Deep hole underway at
LaRonde.  Expected to hit mineralization
at 3.8 kilometres below surface

·                  Deep hole at Ellison expected
to hit Westwood mineralization at 2.0 kilometres below surface

 












 

“These recent drilling
results reconfirm our belief that there is considerable exploration upside at
Kittila and Pinos Altos.  Based on these
recent drilling results, it is possible that Kittila will become our largest
gold deposit, and one of the largest in Europe. 
Additionally, Pinos Altos appears that it will ultimately support
several stand-alone satellite zones which will supplement the production from
the main Santo Nino deposit,” said Sean Boyd, Vice-Chairman and CEO. “Our
long-term strategy remains unchanged. 
Add early-stage ounces which will allow us to continue our record of
increasing our shareholders exposure to gold on a per share basis.  This increasing exposure should be apparent
in terms of reserves per share, production per share, and ultimately cash flow
per share where Agnico-Eagle continues to be one of the industry leaders,”
added Mr. Boyd.

 

Kittila — Extensions at depth at Suuri and Roura zones

 

In 2009, approximately
14,000 hectares were added to the overall property position for a total land
package at Kittila of 26,550 hectares. 
Of this, the mining license area consists of 850 hectares.

 

Since the last
exploration update, exploration drilling has continued to yield significant
gold intersections at depth within and outside the Suuri mineral resource
envelope.  Most of the drilling has been
between depths of 700 and 1,000 metres. 
The objective of the program is to systematically convert the large
amount of resources to reserves.  Suuri
holds approximately 7.8 million tonnes grading 5.6 g/t gold, or approximately
1.4 million ounces of gold, in inferred resources between the depths of 800
metres and 1,100 metres below surface, as outlined in red on the following
Kittila longitudinal section.

East Lens Remains Continuous

 

Among the best
intersections in the Suuri zone is drill hole SUU-08-001E  that
intersected 5.8 metres(1) grading 10.3 g/t gold at a depth of 833 metres
below surface.  This intersection is in
the East lens and confirms the continuity suggested by the previous drill
program.  Also in the East lens, but shallower
and 220 metres to the south, DDH SUU-09-006C intersected 5.5 metres grading 9.6
g/t at a depth of 680 metres.  This
further confirmed the grade, thickness, continuity and potential of the East
lens of the Suuri deposit at depth and along strike.

 

Central Lens Showing Increasing
Thickness

 

The Central lens of Suuri
has recently yielded two significant intersections.  Drill hole SUU-09-005C cut  12.0 metres grading 7.2 g/t gold at a depth of 813 metres,
and drill hole SUU-09-005D cut 18.6 metres grading 8.0 g/t gold at a depth of
816 metres.  These intersections are at
the northern edge of the Suuri inferred resources at depth.  These holes are among the highest value
intersections the Company has encountered

at Kittila, in terms of
grade and thickness.  These recent
results from the Central lens are very encouraging as the resource calculation
from February 2009 considered only the Eastern lens so additional growth
within the current resource outline remains possible.

 

The Company will continue
to explore the area outside the current resource envelope.  The most recent drilling is targeting a large
new area of potential (outlined in green on the linked Kittila longitudinal
section) where the Suuri zone plunges northward beneath the Roura zone. In
fact, current results indicate that Suuri and Roura join together as one
continuous zone in this region, which has positive implications for expanding
the deep resources.

 

One recent drill hole in
this new area is ROU-08-003C that cut a new high grade lens (the “Roura East
lens”) at a depth of 810 metres. The hole intersected  6.5
metres grading 6.1 g/t gold and will be followed-up with additional
drilling.  If this drilling confirms the
continuity of this new high-grade lens at depth, it could have important
implications for future resource expansion.

 

Exploration results were
also positive in the under-explored, relatively shallow Ketola zone, located
600 metres to the south of the main Suuri zone. Drill hole KET-09-004
intersected two gold intervals: 3.7 metres grading 4.1 g/t gold at
about 240 metres depth, and 0.9 metre grading 8.9 g/t gold at 285 metres depth.
The intervals lie between
30 to 80 metres below the current resource model, indicating that the zone
continues at depth.  At the end of 2008,
Ketola had total probable reserves of approximately 611,000 tonnes grading 4.5
g/t gold, containing over 89,000 ounces of gold.

 

The table below shows
selected drill results received since those announced in the September 8,
2009 press release.

Underground definition
drilling continues in the Suuri and Roura areas between 250 and 400 metres
below surface, which has confirmed the thickness and grade of one of the
thickest parts of the Roura orebody.

The Company is currently
preparing the first test stope underground. 
The objective is to validate the grade and ground conditions.  Extraction is expected to begin in 2010.

 

A new reserve and
resource model, incorporating this year’s drill results, will be completed for
all of Agnico-Eagle’s properties at the end of 2009.  The new model will be incorporated into the
Kittila expansion study, which is expected to result in a significant portion
of the deep resource envelope being converted into reserves.  The expansion study is evaluating a
significant increase to the gold production rate.  The deeper ore would be accessed by a new
production shaft, and would require an increase to the capacity of the mineral
processing plant.  The expansion study is
expected to be completed in early 2010 with review completed near mid-year.

 

Pinos
Altos — Sinter and Cubiro Growing and Better Defined

 

The Pinos Altos mine comprises a series
of open pits, which will eventually be supplemented by underground production,
primarily from the large Santo Nino deposit. 
However, drilling over the past couple of years has identified a number
of satellite deposits on the large 11,000 hectare property position.

 

The Creston Mascota deposit,
approximately seven kilometres northwest of Santo Nino is already under construction.  First production from this stand-alone heap
leach operation is expected in the fourth quarter of 2010.

 

More recently, drilling from the Sinter
deposit and the new Cubiro deposit has suggested that there is potential for
these zones to be mined also by open pit heap leach methods.

 

Sinter -
Possible Satellite Mine Project

 

Exploration results to date have confirmed the
potential of the Sinter deposit, which was discovered by the previous owner of
the property.  To the end of October, the Company had
completed 72 drill holes for a total of 15,000 metres.  Two rigs continue to explore the deposit.  This area is
located in the central part of the Reyna de Plata vein structure 1.7 kilometres
north of the Santo Nino pit.  The Reyna
de Plata structure is a northwest-striking fault zone that controls gold
mineralization, similar to the Santo Nino gold structure that hosts most of the
current reserves and resources at Pinos Altos. Reyna de Plata holds
considerable potential and has been the focus of regional exploration this
year.

 

The work
completed so far at Sinter has been both inside and outside the current
resource envelope.  The drilling has
confirmed and expanded the gold and silver mineralization in this area.  Preliminary mining, as well as baseline
environmental and metallurgical studies, have been initiated for the Sinter
deposit.

Several
exploration holes were completed on the eastern side of the Sinter deposit and
two rigs are following up on the encouraging results.  The sub-vertical mineralized zone has been
traced along strike for almost 1,100 metres and remains open near surface and
at depth to the east.

 

The table below
highlights some of the most recent drill results.  The best intersection was from drill hole
SIN-09-036 with 29.6 metres grading 1.20 g/t gold and 20.4 g/t silver at a
depth of approximately 115 metres below surface.  This intercept also includes 3.0 metres
grading 3.32 g/t gold and 37.0 g/t silver.

Drilling Further Defines Cubiro Discovery

 

Exploration drilling continued in the new
Cubiro area, where a gold-silver discovery was made approximately 10 kilometres
northwest of the Santo Nino pit.  To the
end of October, the Company had completed 44 drill holes totaling 10,300
metres.  Work is continuing on the
deposit with two portable drill rigs.

 

The Cubiro zone of quartz-calcite vein
breccia and stockwork mineralization has been traced over 700 metres along a
northwest strike and dips almost vertically from surface to a depth of between
60 and 250 metres.  Most of the central,
higher grade portion of the vein is visible at surface or has been found very
close to surface. The mineralization remains open near surface to the
northwest, and is open at depth in the central area and to the southeast. The
vein appears to have multiple branches or splays that occur in several places
as exhibited in the linked cross section below.

 

http://www.agnico-eagle.com/files/CubiroLongCrossSectionNov09.pdf

 

Recent drill results are summarized in
the table below, including drill hole CB-09-023 that intersected 10.5 metres
grading 7.55 g/t gold and 28.1 g/t silver in the western portion of the Cubiro
zone at a vertical depth of 97 metres below surface.

Improvement of access roads is underway
at Cubiro to facilitate further exploration by diamond drilling.  Exploration continues, and a mineral resource
estimate is expected for the Cubiro zone in 2010.

 

Abitibi
Update

 

An
exploration program was initiated in 2009 to investigate the ultimate depth of
zone 20 North, which contains most of the mineral reserves and resources of the
LaRonde mine.  The first hole in this
program is expected to intersect the zone at an depth of 3,700 metres below
surface, which would be approximately 600 metres below the current reserve
envelope.  Confirmation of the depth
extension of the LaRonde orebody at depth could be significant with respect to
defining further resources.

 

Additionally, the Company is exploring its Ellison property, located
approximately four kilometres west of the LaRonde mine.  One hole is being drilled from surface,
targeting an extension of Iamgold’s Westwood deposit, which is known to cross
the boundary onto Ellison.  The Westwood
orebody begins approximately 2 kilometres below surface and is between the
Ellison property and Iamgold’s Doyon property, in the same favourable horizon
as the Bousquet (past producer), LaRonde and Doyon mines.  Drilling began November 9 and is
anticipated to reach the target area in the first quarter of 2010.

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

The information in this press release has
been prepared as at November 30, 2009. Certain statements contained in
this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and “forward
looking information” under the provisions of Canadian provincial securities
laws. When used in this document, words such as “anticipate”, “expect”, “estimate,”
“forecast,” “planned”, “will”, “likely” and similar expressions are intended to
identify forward-looking statements and are referred to herein as “forward-looking
statements”.

 

Such statements include without
limitation: the Company’s forward-looking production guidance, including
estimated ore grades, metal production, life of mine horizons, the estimated
timing of scoping studies, internal rates of return, and projected exploration
and capital expenditures, including costs and other estimates upon which such
projections are based; the Company’s goal to increase its mineral reserves and
resources; and other statements and information regarding anticipated trends
with respect to the Company’s operations, exploration and the funding thereof.
Such statements reflect the Company’s views as at the date of this press
release and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of factors and
assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Agnico-Eagle as of the date of
such statements, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and
competitive uncertainties and contingencies. The factors and assumptions of
Agnico-Eagle contained in this news release, which may prove to be incorrect,
include, but are not limited to, the assumptions set forth herein and in
management’s discussion and analysis and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F
for the year ended December 31, 2008 (“Form 20-F”) as well as: that
there are no significant disruptions affecting operations, whether due to
labour disruptions, supply disruptions, damage to equipment, natural
occurrences, political changes, title issues or otherwise; that permitting,
development and expansion at each of Agnico-

 

8












 

Eagle’s development projects proceeds on
a basis consistent with current expectations, and that Agnico-Eagle does not
change its development plans relating to such projects; that the exchange rate
between the Canadian dollar, European Union euro, Mexican peso and the United States
dollar will be approximately consistent with current levels or as set out in
this news release; that prices for gold, silver, zinc, copper and lead will be
consistent with Agnico-Eagle’s expectations; that prices for key mining and
construction supplies, including labour costs, remain consistent with
Agnico-Eagle’s current expectations; that production meets expectations; that
Agnico-Eagle’s current estimates of mineral reserves, mineral resources,
mineral grades and metal recovery are accurate; that there are no material
delays in the timing for completion of ongoing development projects; and that
there are no material variations in the current tax and regulatory
environment.  Many factors, known and
unknown, could cause the actual results to be materially different from those
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks include,
but are not limited to: the volatility of prices of gold and other metals;
uncertainty of mineral reserves, mineral resources, mineral grades and metal
recovery estimates; uncertainty of future production, capital expenditures, and
other costs; currency fluctuations; financing of additional capital
requirements; cost of exploration and development programs; mining risks; risks
associated with foreign operations; governmental and environmental regulation;
the volatility of the Company’s stock price; and risks associated with the
Company’s byproduct metal derivative strategies. For a more detailed discussion
of such risks and other factors, see the Company’s Form 20-F for the year
ended December 31, 2008, as well as the Company’s other filings with the
Canadian Securities Administrators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”). The Company does not intend, and does not assume any
obligation, to update these forward-looking statements and information, except
as required by law. Accordingly, readers are advised not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements. Certain of the foregoing statements, primarily
related to projects, are based on preliminary views of the Company with respect
to, among other things, grade, tonnage, processing, mining methods, capital
costs, total cash costs, minesite costs, and location of surface
infrastructure.  Actual results and final
decisions may be materially different from those current anticipated.

 

Notes To Investors
Regarding The Use Of Resources

 

Cautionary Note To
Investors Concerning Estimates Of Measured And Indicated Resources

 

This press
release uses the terms “measured resources” and “indicated resources”. We
advise investors that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian
regulations, the SEC does not recognize them. Investors
are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these
categories will ever be converted into reserves.

 

Cautionary Note To
Investors Concerning Estimates Of Inferred Resources

 

This press
release also uses the term “inferred resources”. We advise investors that while
this term is recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not
recognize it. “Inferred resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to
their 

 

9












 

existence, and
great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be
assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be
upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred
mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility
studies, except in rare cases. Investors are
cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is
economically or legally mineable.

 

Scientific And Technical
Data

 

Agnico-Eagle
Mines Limited is reporting mineral resource and reserve estimates in accordance
with the CIM guidelines for the estimation, classification and reporting of
resources and reserves.

 

Cautionary Note To U.S.
Investors  - The
SEC permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose
only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract
or produce. We use certain terms in this press release, such as “measured”, “indicated”,
and “inferred”, and “resources” that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S.
registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. U.S.
Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F,
which may be obtained from us, or from the SEC’s website at: http://sec.gov/edgar.shtml.  A “final”
or “bankable” feasibility study is required to meet the requirements to
designate reserves under Industry Guide 7. 
Estimates were calculated using historic three-year average metals
prices and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the SEC Industry Guide 7.  Industry Guide 7 requires the use of prices
that reflect current economic conditions at the time of reserve determination
which Staff of the SEC has interpreted to mean historic three-year average
prices.  The assumptions used for the
mineral reserves and resources estimate reported by the Company on February 18th,
2009 were based on three-year average prices for the period ending December 31,
2008 of $725 per ounce gold, $13.32 per ounce silver, $1.27 per pound zinc,
$3.15 per pound copper, $0.90 per pound lead and C$/US$, US$/Euro and MXP/US$
exchange rates of 1.09, 1.37 and 11.00, respectively.

 

The Canadian
Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) requires
mining companies to disclose reserves and resources using the subcategories of “proven”
reserves, “probable” reserves, “measured” resources, “indicated” resources and “inferred”
resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have
demonstrated economic viability.

 

A mineral
reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated resource
demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study must
include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and
other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that
economic extraction can be justified. A mineral reserve includes diluting
materials and allows for losses that may occur when the material is mined. A
proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured resource
for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical
characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the
economic viability of 

 

10












 

the deposit. A
probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated
mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and
physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient
to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to
support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.

 

A mineral
resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or
fossilized organic material in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and
quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for
economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics
and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from
specific geological evidence and knowledge. A measured mineral resource is that
part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities,
shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic
parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability
of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration,
sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are
spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. An
indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can
be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate
application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits,
workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and
grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. An inferred mineral resource is that
part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be
estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The
estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits,
workings and drill holes. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do
not have demonstrated economic viability.

 

Investors are cautioned
not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically
or legally mineable.

 

A feasibility
study is a comprehensive study of a mineral deposit in which all geological,
engineering, legal, operating, economic, social, environmental and other
relevant factors are considered in sufficient detail that it could reasonably
serve as the basis for a final decision by a financial institution to finance
the development of the deposit for mineral production.
