      MANAGEMENT'S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
      
      Alcon, Inc.'s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting.  Alcon, Inc.'s internal control system was designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of
its published consolidated financial statements.
      
      All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
      
      Alcon, Inc.'s management assessed the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria
established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this
assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, Alcon,
Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria.

        REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
        
        To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of
        Alcon,
Inc.:
        
        
          We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alcon, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2008.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
          
          We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
          
          In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Alcon, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
          
          As
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January
1, 2008, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
          
          As
discussed in notes 1 and 16, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented
the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.
          
          As
discussed in note 14, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented SFAS
No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements.
          
          As
discussed in note 9, effective January 1, 2007, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.
          
          As
discussed in note 1, effective December 31, 2006, the Company implemented the
recognition and related disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.
          
          As
discussed in notes 1 and 12, effective January 1, 2006, the Company implemented
SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based
Payment.
          
          We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Alcon, Inc.'s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 16, 2009 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

        To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of
        Alcon,
Inc.:
         
        
          We have
audited Alcon, Inc.'s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).  Alcon, Inc.'s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
          
          We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
          
          A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
          
          Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
          
          In our
opinion, Alcon, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
          
          We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Alcon, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008,
and our report dated March 16, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

consolidated entities are included on the basis of a calendar year.

                  Management
      Estimates
                
              
          
        
        
        Management
of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the
reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP").  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
        
        (d)   Foreign
Currency
        
        The
reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar.  The
financial position and results of operations of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries are generally determined using the local currency as the functional
currency.  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries have been
translated at the rate of exchange at the end of each
period.  Revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted
average rate of exchange in effect during the period.  Gains and
losses resulting from translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.  The impact of
subsidiaries located in countries whose economies are considered highly
inflationary is insignificant.  Gains and losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in nonoperating
earnings.  Under Swiss corporate law, Alcon is required to declare any
dividends on its common shares in Swiss francs.
        
        (e)   Cash
and Cash Equivalents
        
        Cash
equivalents include demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less.
        
        (f)    Inventories
        
        Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined
primarily using the first-in, first-out method.

                  The
      Company holds investments of various types, maturities and
      classifications.
                
              
          
        
        
        Trading
Securities.  Trading securities are stated at fair value, with
gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in
earnings.  Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these
securities are included in the consolidated statements of earnings in other,
net.
        
        Available-for-Sale
Investments.  Investments designated as available-for-sale
include marketable debt and equity securities.  Investments designated
as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholders' equity.  The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification
method.  Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are
recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings in other,
net.  Should the decline in value of any investment be deemed to be
other-than-temporary, the investment basis is written down to fair value and the
write-down is recorded to earnings as a loss in other, net.
        
        
          
              
                
                   
      
                
                
                  Held-to-Maturity
      Investments.  The Company holds no investments classified
      as held-to-maturity.
                
              
          
        
        
        Short Term/Long Term
Classification.  The Company considers all liquid
interest-earning investments with original maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.  Debt securities with maturities greater than
three months and less than one year are classified as short term
investments.  Generally, debt securities with remaining maturities
greater than one year are classified as long term
investments.  However, investments with maturities greater than one
year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and
because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations.
        
        (h)   Financial
Instruments
        
        The
Company uses various derivative financial instruments on a limited basis as part
of a strategy to manage the Company's exposure to certain market risks
associated with interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
expected to occur within the next twelve months.  The Company
evaluates the use of interest rate swaps and periodically uses such arrangements
to manage its interest risk on selected debt instruments.
        
        The
Company regularly uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the
effect of exchange rate changes on certain foreign currency denominated
intercompany and third-party transactions.  The forward exchange
contracts establish the exchange rates at which the Company purchases or sells
the contracted amount of foreign currencies for specified local currencies at a
future date.  The Company uses forward contracts, which are short term
in nature, and receives or pays the difference between the contracted forward
rate and the exchange rate at the settlement date.
        
        All of
the Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair
value.  For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as fair
value hedges, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded immediately in
earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities
being hedged.  For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as
cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders' equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transaction affects earnings.
        
        (i)    Property,
Plant and Equipment
        
        Property,
plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.  Additions, major
renewals and improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs
are expensed.  Upon disposition, the book value of assets and related
accumulated depreciation is relieved and the resulting gains or losses are
reflected in earnings.

        (j)    Goodwill
and Intangible Assets, Net
        
        Goodwill
is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least
annually.  Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives to their residual values and
reviewed for recoverability upon the occurrence of an event that might indicate
conditions for impairment could exist.
        
        Intangible
assets, net, consist of acquired customer base, trademarks, patents and licensed
technology.  The cost of these intangible assets is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
which are 4 to 20 years.
        
        (k)   Impairment
        
        Long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
        
        (l)    Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans
        
        The
Company sponsors several defined contribution plans, defined benefit retirement
plans and a postretirement healthcare plan.
        
        The
Company provides for the benefits payable to employees on retirement by charging
current service costs to income systematically over the expected service lives
of employees who participate in defined benefit plans.  An actuarially
computed amount is determined at the beginning of each year by using valuation
methods that attribute the cost of the retirement benefits to periods of
employee service.  Such valuation methods incorporate assumptions
concerning employees' projected compensation and healthcare cost
trends.  Prior service costs for plan amendments are generally charged
to income systematically over the remaining expected service lives of
participating employees.
        
        Effective
December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and related disclosure
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 158,
"Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R)."  Under SFAS No. 158, the overfunded or underfunded status of
defined benefit postretirement plans (other than multiemployer plans) must be
shown as an asset or liability in the balance sheet and changes in the funded
status are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through other
comprehensive income.  The Company elected to delay adoption of the
provision to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end
balance sheet.  The Company adopted the measurement date provisions of
SFAS No. 158 effective January 1, 2008.  The Company utilized the
alternate transition method to transition the measurement date for its defined
pension benefit plan in Japan from September 30 to December 31.  Under
this transition method, the Company charged 3/15ths of the estimated pension
cost from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 (or $0.8, net of taxes) to
retained earnings as of January 1, 2008.  Under SFAS No. 158,
retrospective application was not permitted.
        
        The cost
recognized for defined contribution plans is based upon the contribution
required for the period.

        (m)  Revenue
Recognition
        
        The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104.
        
        The
Company recognizes revenue on product sales when the customer takes title and
assumes risk of loss except for surgical equipment sales.  If the
customer takes title and assumes risk of loss upon shipment, revenue is
recognized on the shipment date.  If the customer takes title and
assumes risk of loss upon delivery, revenue is recognized on the delivery
date.  Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after
deducting estimated amounts for rebates and product returns.
        
        The
Company recognizes revenue on surgical equipment sales when the customer takes
title and assumes risk of loss and when installation and any required training
have been completed.  Per procedure technology fees related to LADARVision®
refractive laser systems are recognized in the period when the procedure is
performed.  Per procedure technology fees associated with treatment
cards related to refractive products manufactured by WaveLight AG are recognized
when the treatment cards are delivered and title and risks of ownership are
transferred.
        
        When the
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products, certain items, such as
cash discounts, allowances and rebates, which are known and estimable at the
time of sale, are recorded as a reduction of sales in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-9, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's
Products)."  To the extent the customer will, or is expected to,
reduce its payment on the related invoice amounts, these items are reflected as
a reduction of accounts receivable and sales.
        
        In
accordance with certain government rebate requirements (such as those under U.S.
Medicaid and Medicare) and with certain contractual agreements, the Company is
required to pay rebates to customers, their customers or government agencies
under provisions that limit the amounts that may be paid for pharmaceuticals and
surgical devices.  The amount of accrued product rebates is included
in other current liabilities.
        
        The
Company records a reduction of sales for estimated discounts, allowances and
rebates in the period in which the related sales occur, based upon historical
experience of amounts paid and amounts as a percentage of sales.  The
Company also considers the effects of changes in product pricing, in sales
trends, in contract terms and in laws and regulations.
        
        Value
added taxes and other sales taxes are excluded from sales.
        
        (n)   Research
and Development
        
        Internal
research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Third-party
research and development costs are expensed as the contracted work is performed
or as milestone results have been achieved.
        
        (o)   Selling,
General and Administrative
        
        Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $179.7, $151.1 and
$130.4 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
        
        Shipping
and handling costs amounted to $76.2, $66.3 and $56.6 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.
        
        Legal
costs are expensed during the period incurred.
        
        (p)   Income
Taxes
        
        The
Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary
differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Company's assets, liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing

changes in tax rates and laws, if any, are applied to the years during which
temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected in the financial
statements in the period of enactment.  Withholding taxes have been
provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries which are not reinvested
indefinitely in such operations.  Dividends paid by subsidiaries to
Alcon, Inc. do not result in Swiss income taxes.
        
        (q)   Basic
and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share
        
        Basic
earnings per common share were computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the relevant
period.  The unvested portion of restricted common shares was excluded
in the calculation of basic weighted average common shares
outstanding.  Diluted weighted average common shares reflect the
potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, that could occur if
employee stock options for the purchase of common shares and share-settled stock
appreciation rights were exercised and if share-settled restricted share units
and contingent restricted common shares granted to employees were
vested.
        
        The
following table reconciles the weighted average shares of the basic and diluted
share computations:

        Certain
executives of the Company had deferred the receipt of 146,883 and 161,097 Alcon
common shares at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, into the Alcon
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") discussed in note
13.  Alcon common shares held in the DCP were reflected as outstanding
in the consolidated balance sheets and were included in the applicable basic and
diluted earnings per share calculations.
        
        The
computations of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 did not include the following
instruments, as their exercise prices and unrecognized costs were greater than
the average market price of the common shares:

              NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (in
millions, except share data)
              
            
          
        
        (s)    Share-Based
Compensation
        
        Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based
Payment."  SFAS No. 123(R) requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and
directors, based on estimated "fair values."
        
        The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
using the modified prospective transition method.  Under that
transition method, compensation cost recognized in the year ended December 31,
2006 included:
        
        
          
              
                
                  (a)  
                
                
                  compensation
      cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of
      January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date "fair value" estimated in
      accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,
    and
                
              
          
        
        
        
          
              
                
                  (b)  
                
                
                  compensation
      cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006,
      based on the grant-date "fair value" estimated in accordance with the
      provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).
                
              
          
        
        
        SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to
estimate the "fair value" of share-based payment awards as of the date of grant
using an option-pricing model.  The value of the portion of the award
that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period.  Share-based compensation
expenses recognized in net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006 were based on awards ultimately expected to vest, and therefore the
amounts were reduced for estimated forfeitures.  SFAS No. 123(R)
requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ materially from
those estimates.  SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that excess tax
benefits related to share-based compensation be reflected as financing cash
flows rather than operating cash flows.
        
        The Company records deferred tax assets
for share-based awards that result in deductions on the Company's income tax
returns, based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the Company's
statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it expects to receive a
deduction.  Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for
financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the
Company's income tax return are recorded in additional paid-in capital (if the
tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset) or in the consolidated statement
of earnings (if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no
additional paid-in capital exists from previous awards).
        
        (t)   
Treasury Shares
        
        Treasury
shares are accounted for by the cost method.  The board of directors
has approved the purchase of Alcon common shares for various purposes as
described in notes 12 and 17.
        
        (u)   Warranty
Reserves
        
        The
Company generally warrants its surgical equipment against defects for a period
of one year from the installation date.  Warranty costs are estimated
and expensed at the date of sale and the resulting accrued liability is
amortized over the warranty period.  Such costs are estimated based on
actual cost experience.
        
        (v)   Reclassifications
        
        In the
consolidated statements of cash flows and in note 9, certain reclassifications
were made to prior year amounts to conform with current year
presentation.  These reclassifications had no effect on reported
earnings, working capital or shareholders' equity.

                  During
      the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, certain individuals
      terminated employment prior to the vesting of their restricted Alcon
      common shares and forfeited 17,622 shares, 18,969 shares and 3,737 shares,
      respectively.  (See note 12 for discussion of restricted common
      shares.)  The forfeited shares were recorded as treasury shares
      during the respective periods.

      the years ended December 2008, 2007 and 2006, $0.4, $0.3 and $0.2,
      respectively, of dividends, applicable to Alcon common shares that
      previously were deferred into the Alcon Executive Deferred Compensation
      Plan, were not paid in cash but were credited to additional paid-in
      capital until such dividends are delivered in common shares.  In
      2006, 737 treasury shares, representing previously declared dividends
      applicable to common shares withdrawn from this plan, were delivered to
      plan participants.  No such shares were delivered in 2008 and
      2007.

        Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," became effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and generally does not permit retrospective
application.  SFAS No. 159 amends SFAS No. 95, "Statements of Cash
Flows," and directs entities to classify cash receipts and cash payments related
to items measured at fair value according to their nature and
purpose.  As a result, cash receipts and payments related to trading
securities, which were reported in net cash from operating activities in 2007
and 2006, were reported in cash flows from investing activities in 2008 and cash
flows for 2008 are not directly comparable to those reported in 2007 and
2006.  Cash payments and receipts related to available-for-sale
securities have been included in cash flows from investing activities in 2008,
2007 and 2006.

        Year ended December 31,
2007
        
        During the year ended December 31,
2007, the Company recognized losses totaling $32.7 related to the impairment of
certain plant, equipment and intangible assets used in its refractive product
line and to the valuation of refractive product inventories.  The
losses were recorded in cost of goods sold ($24.0) and amortization of
intangibles ($8.7) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended
December 31, 2007.
        
        During March 2007, in connection with
the Company's ongoing review of its refractive product line, the Company
determined that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets used in the refractive
product line probably would not be recovered through the respective projected
cash flows, although the Company continued to use those
assets.  Consequently, the impairment review was conducted using the
then-latest projections on a gross basis to determine whether the carrying
amounts of the refractive assets were recoverable.  After the carrying
amounts were determined not recoverable, a traditional discounted cash flow
calculation was used to estimate the fair values of the

        Year ended December 31,
2006
        
        During the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company identified impairment losses totaling $144.8 related to
certain plant, equipment and intangible assets.  The respective losses
were recognized in cost of goods sold ($19.1) and amortization of intangibles
($125.7) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December
31, 2006.
        
        The Company's corporate planning
process indicated that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets used in the
refractive product line probably would not be recovered through the respective
projected cash flows, although the Company continued to use those
assets.  Consequently, the impairment review was conducted using the
then-latest projections in the corporate planning process on a gross basis to
determine whether the carrying amounts of the refractive assets were
recoverable.  After the carrying amounts were determined not
recoverable, a traditional discounted cash flow calculation was used to estimate
the fair values of the refractive assets for the purpose of measuring the
impairment losses, as the Company believes this approach provided the most
reasonable estimate of the fair values of those assets.

        In June
2008, the Company entered into a patent cross-licensing agreement under which it
paid a lump sum of $31.0 for certain paid-up, non-exclusive, worldwide licenses
related to coating systems used in intraocular lens insertion
devices.  The Company recorded $22.5 of the amount paid as an
intangible asset with a remaining useful life of approximately 8
years.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, the remaining $8.5 of
the amount paid was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses, as
was also the $10.0 lump sum received by the Company in exchange for certain
paid-up, non-exclusive, worldwide licenses related to intraocular
lenses.

        At
December 31, 2008, the Company had several unsecured line of credit agreements
with third parties totaling $476.5 that were denominated in various
currencies.  The commitment fees related to unused borrowings under
these facilities were less than $0.5 during 2008, 2007 and 2006.  The
weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 3.8% and
4.7%, respectively.  The amounts outstanding under these agreements at
December 31, 2008 were due at various dates during 2009.

        At
December 31, 2008, the Company had a $2,000.0 commercial paper
facility.  At December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance carried an
average interest rate of 0.7% before fees.  Nestlé guarantees the
commercial paper facility and assists in its management, for which the Company
pays Nestlé an annual fee based on the average outstanding commercial paper
balances.  The Company's management believes that any fees paid by the
Company to Nestlé for their guarantee of any indebtedness or for the management
of the commercial paper program are comparable to the fees that would be paid in
an arm's length transaction.  Total fees paid to Nestlé in connection
with this facility for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
$0.7, $0.4 and $0.4, respectively.
        
        The
Company had various unsecured promissory notes and line of credit agreements
denominated in various currencies with several subsidiaries of
Nestlé.  These short term borrowings at December 31, 2008 were either
due on demand or at various dates during 2009.  The weighted average
interest rates at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 2.4% and 3.7%,
respectively.  The unused portion under the line of credit agreements
was $202.7 at December 31, 2008.
        
        The
Company had several unsecured bank overdraft lines of credit denominated in
various currencies totaling $176.7 at December 31, 2008.  The weighted
average interest rates on bank overdrafts at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
8.1% and 7.3%, respectively.

        Income
tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflected a net reduction of
$271.0 for period items, including a reduction of $235.7 related to losses
associated with the Company's investment in and advances to its former
subsidiary, Summit Autonomous, Inc., as well as reductions related to progress
in audit settlements, advance pricing agreement negotiations, the lapse of
statutes of limitation and other minor items.
        
        Current
tax expense does not reflect benefits of $61.3, $110.8 and $96.1 for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to restricted
shares and the exercise of employee stock options, recorded directly to
additional paid-in capital.
        
        In 2008, the Company realized certain
Swiss tax benefits totaling approximately $130.0 for its commitment to relocate
and significantly expand its global administration operations in
Switzerland.  The initial term of these benefits is expected to
continue from 2008 for a period of five years.  These benefits would
be extended for an additional five years if the Company fulfills certain
employment commitments and maintains these commitments through
2022.

the valuation allowance at December 31, 2007 was primarily related to loss
carryforwards that did not appear to be more likely than not to be
realized.  Based on the Company's historical pretax earnings,
management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the
benefit of the existing net deferred income tax assets at December 31,
2008.  Management believes the existing net deductible temporary
differences will reverse during periods in which the Company generates net
taxable earnings; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will
generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future
years.  Certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented,
if necessary, to supplement earnings from operations to fully realize tax
benefits.
        
        Withholding
taxes of approximately $63.2 have not been provided on approximately $1,263.4 of
unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries since such earnings are, or will be,
reinvested in operations indefinitely.
        
        The Company or one of its subsidiaries
files income tax returns in Switzerland, the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and
various state and foreign jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to Swiss, U.S. federal, state and local, or
non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before
2003.  In the first quarter of 2007, the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") commenced an examination of the Company's U.S. income tax returns for
2003 through 2005 that is anticipated to be completed by the end of the second
quarter of 2009.  The Company also currently is subject to income tax
examinations by various state, local and foreign tax authorities.  In
addition, the Company is currently negotiating a bilateral advance pricing
agreement ("APA") between Switzerland and the United States covering years
through 2014 for all material intercompany transactions involving

        Company
and its subsidiaries in these two jurisdictions.  The U.S. and Swiss
Competent Authorities met during the third quarter of 2008 and the Company
anticipates the mutual agreement letter to be signed by the end of the first
half of 2009.  During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company
submitted a similar request for a bilateral APA between Japanese and Swiss tax
authorities that would cover the tax years 2008 through 2012.  The
Company expects that the Japanese-Swiss APA will be concluded in 2009 or
2010.
        
        The Company believes that it takes
reasonable positions on its tax returns filed throughout the world; however, tax
laws are complex and susceptible to differing interpretations.  Tax
authorities throughout the world routinely challenge positions taken by the
Company, particularly in the case of transfer pricing issues.  The
Company has identified its uncertain tax positions and prepared its reserve for
contingent tax liabilities to reflect the associated unrecognized tax benefits
(the "Tax Reserves") in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 which, among other things, requires that the
Company assume that it will be subject to examination in every jurisdiction in
which it is subject to tax.  Management believes that the Tax Reserves
are fairly stated, but believes it is reasonably possible that the total amounts
of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing, capitalization and
other tax positions reflected in the Tax Reserves will significantly increase
within 12 months of the reporting of this financial statement as the result of,
among other things, (i) developments with respect to currently active audits or
advance pricing agreements, and/or (ii) the further development of tax laws
through judicial or administrative actions.  Given the complexity of
the issues involved and the uncertainty with respect to the actual date that any
of the currently active audits or APA negotiations could reach final resolution
or a new audit could commence, management cannot reasonably estimate a range of
the possible increase in unrecognized tax benefits that could occur in the next
12 months.  However, the Company believes it is reasonably possible
that over 75% of the Tax Reserves could be eliminated during the next 12 months
as a result of actual payment of amounts included in the Tax Reserves and/or
developments in various audits concerning multiple issues, including transfer
pricing concerns.
        
        The Company adopted the provisions of
FIN No. 48, effective January 1, 2007.  As a result of the
implementation of FIN No. 48, the Company recognized a $30.0 decrease in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase
to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.  A reconciliation
of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of
interest and penalties, is as follows:

        The total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits at January 1, 2007 after adoption of FIN No. 48 was $235.3, excluding
gross interest and penalties of $20.7.  The respective amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if
recognized, was $211.0, excluding net interest and penalties of
$13.4.  As of January 1, 2007, the Company included $104.0 in other
long term liabilities for the Tax Reserves, net of deposits with statutory
authorities.  Prior to January 1, 2007 and the adoption of FIN No. 48,
the Company classified Tax Reserves, net of deposits with statutory authorities,
as accrued taxes in other current liabilities.
        
        During the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest
and penalties, included in the Tax Reserves decreased by $195.9 to $129.4 and
increased by $90.0 to $325.3, respectively.  The net decrease in
unrecognized tax benefits in 2008 reflects (i) the Company's Pre-Filing Agreement with the
IRS related to losses associated with the Company's investment in and advances to
its former subsidiary, Summit Autonomous, Inc. of $178.5 and (ii) net reductions
of $17.4 related to progress on audit settlements, APA negotiations, the lapse
of statutes of limitation and other minor items.  The 2007 net

        The Company's policy is to classify
interest and penalties in income tax expense.  The gross amount of
interest and penalties accrued as part of the Tax Reserves at December 31, 2008
and 2007 was $18.3 and $17.1, respectively.  At December 31, 2008, the
consolidated balance sheet included $1.4 in other current liabilities and $28.6
in other long term liabilities for the Tax Reserves, net of deposits with
statutory authorities.  At December 31, 2007, the consolidated balance
sheet included $200.7 for the Tax Reserves, net of deposits with statutory
authorities, in other long term liabilities.

        The
Company conducts its global business through two business segments: Alcon United
States and Alcon International.  Alcon United States includes sales to
unaffiliated customers located in the United States of America, excluding Puerto
Rico.  Alcon United States operating income is derived from operating
profits within the United States.  Alcon International includes sales
to all other unaffiliated customers.
        
        Each
business segment markets and sells products principally in three product
categories of the ophthalmic market:  (1) pharmaceutical (prescription
drugs), (2) surgical equipment and devices (cataract, vitreoretinal and
refractive), and (3) consumer eye care (contact lens disinfectants and cleaning
solutions, artificial tears and ocular vitamins).  Business segment
operations generally do not include research and development, certain
manufacturing and other corporate functions.
        
        Segment
performance is measured based on sales and operating income reported in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.
        
        Certain
manufacturing costs and manufacturing variances are not assigned to business
segments because most manufacturing operations produce products for more than
one business segment.  Research and development costs, excluding
regulatory costs which are included in the business segments, are treated as
general corporate costs and are not assigned to business segments.
        
        Identifiable
assets are not assigned by business segment and are not considered in evaluating
the performance of the business segments.

        Under the 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan,
the Company's board of directors may award to officers, directors and key
employees share-based compensation, including stock options, share-settled stock
appreciation rights ("SSARs"), restricted shares, share-settled restricted share
units ("RSUs"), performance share units and certain cash-settled liability
awards.  The total number of shares that may be issued under the plan
with respect to such awards cumulatively shall not exceed the lesser of 30
million Alcon common shares or 10% of the shares issued and
outstanding.  The grant prices for stock options or stock appreciation
rights are determined by the board and shall not be lower than the prevailing
stock exchange price upon the grant of the award.
        
        Individual grants become exercisable
generally on or after the third anniversary of the grant and lapse on the tenth
anniversary of the grant.  Grants prior to February 2006 also become
exercisable upon early retirement at or after age 55.  If there is a
change in control (as defined by the plan), the exercise or vesting of the
awards accelerates.
        
        Beginning in February 2006, consistent
with earlier grants, participants may vest in the stock option and SSAR grants
upon early retirement at or after age 55; however, under grants subsequent to
January 2006, participants may exercise these instruments only on or after the
third anniversary of the grant.  Restricted share and restricted share
unit awards are subject to a three-year cliff vesting; furthermore, participants
retiring before reaching age 60 will forfeit some or all of such awards granted
subsequent to January 2006 if the three-year service period has not
expired.
        
        The Company intends to satisfy all
equity awards granted prior to December 31, 2003 and after December 31, 2007
with the issuance of new shares from conditional capital authorized for the 2002
Alcon Incentive Plan.  At December 31, 2008, the Company had reserved
approximately 13.3 million Alcon common shares for issuance pursuant to the 2002
Alcon Incentive Plan.

        The
Company's board of directors has authorized the acquisition on the open market
of Alcon common shares to, among other things, satisfy the share-based awards
requirements granted under the 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan.  At December
31, 2008, outstanding authorizations by the Company's board of directors would
have permitted the purchase of approximately 1.8 million Alcon common
shares.  The Company has purchased treasury shares on the open market
to satisfy the majority of the outstanding equity awards granted subsequent to
December 31, 2003 and prior to January 1, 2008.  Additional treasury
shares were purchased during 2008, 2007 and 2006 in anticipation of presenting
the shares to the shareholders for approval of cancellation (note
17).
        
        Net earnings for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 reflected the impact of adopting SFAS No.
123(R) using the modified prospective transition method.  Under that
transition method, compensation cost recognized in the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 included:

        Compensation expense for equity awards
was calculated on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period of
the applicable share-based awards, with acceleration of the expense for
individuals meeting the requirements for retirement, as described
above.
        
        As of December 31, 2008, total
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based equity
compensation arrangements (including share options, SSARs and nonvested share
and share unit awards) granted under the plan was $66.5.  That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4
years.

        The Company based its estimates of
expected volatility on daily historical trading data of its common shares from
March 2002 through the grant dates and, due to its short history as a public
company, other factors, such as the volatility of the common share prices of
other pharmaceutical and surgical companies.
        
        The risk-free interest rate assumptions
were based on implied yields, at the grant dates, of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
bonds having a remaining term equal to the expected term of the employee share
awards.
        
        The expected dividend yield was
estimated generally based upon the Company's historic dividend yield since 2003
and other relevant information.
        
        The Company estimated the expected term
consistent with historical exercise and cancellation activity of its previous
share-based grants with a ten-year contractual term, as well as that of other
pharmaceutical and surgical companies.
        
        Forfeitures of stock options and SSARs
were estimated to be 7.3% in 2008 (6.0% in 2007 and 2.5% in 2006) of the number
granted, based on historical experience.
        
        If factors change and the Company
employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R) to future
periods, the compensation expense that the Company records under SFAS No. 123(R)
may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current
period.

        Performance
Share Units
        
        On February 6, 2008, pursuant to the
2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, the Company's board of directors approved the grant
effective February 11, 2008 of approximately 37,000 performance share units to
the senior executive officers and other selected executives.  The
performance share units are designed to award additional compensation in the
form of Alcon shares if a three-year cumulative earnings per share target is
met.  The final award may be adjusted by a total shareholder return
multiplier.  If the earnings per share targets are not met, the awards
lapse.  These awards do not pay dividend equivalents during the
performance period.  The performance share units vest at the end of a
three-year period, with forfeitures if the recipient is not fully vested before
age 60.
        
        The "fair value" of each performance
share unit was estimated at the grant date assuming that the target performance
goal will be achieved and using a Monte Carlo simulation approach to model
adjustments for total shareholder return modifier provisions.  The
following weighted average assumptions were incorporated into the valuation

        In the
event that the minimum performance goals are not met, previously recognized
compensation cost will be reversed.  The Company recognizes the "fair
values" of performance share units over the required service
period.
        
        Forfeitures of performance share units
were estimated to be 2.3% of the number granted, based on historical experience
and the limited number of executives receiving them.  The status of
the performance share unit awards as of December 31, 2008 and the changes during
the year then ended are presented below:

        The weighted average grant-date market
value of performance share units granted during the year ended December 31, 2008
was $151.83 per share.  No performance share units vested during the
year ended December 31, 2008.  No such instruments were granted or
vested prior to 2008.

        The 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan also
provides that the board may grant cash-settled stock appreciation rights
("CSARs") whereby the grantee may receive the appreciation in share value over
the grant price.  Individual grants become exercisable generally on or
after the third anniversary of the grant and lapse on the tenth anniversary of
the grant.  In addition to scheduled vesting, shares are fully vested
upon meeting the requirements for retirement.
        
        Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Company
accounts for CSARs as share-based liability awards that are remeasured each
reporting period through the awards' settlement dates using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model and similar assumptions to those used for measuring equity
grants.  The risk-free interest rates used at December 31, 2008 were
0.11% to 3.05% and the market price for Alcon common shares was $89.19 per
share.  The risk-free interest rates used at December 31, 2007 were
3.05% to 3.34% and the market price for Alcon's common shares was $143.04 per
share.  The risk-free interest rates used at December 31, 2006 were
4.7% to 5.0% and the market price for Alcon's common shares was $111.77 per
share.
        
        The Company's operating results
included expenses (reversals) related to the CSARs of $(2.1), $5.3 and $(0.9)
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  The weighted average grant-date "fair values" of CSARs
granted during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $131 and $123,
respectively.  No such instruments were granted in

        At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company had 34,756 and 100,182 CSARs outstanding representing liabilities of
$1.3 and $10.2, respectively.  The awards outstanding had expiration
dates ranging from March 2012 through February 2015.
        
        The Company expects to use liability
awards minimally in the future.  As of December 31, 2008, total
unrecognized compensation cost related to CSARs granted under the plan was
$0.1.  That cost is expected to be recognized during
2009.

        The
Company had an unfunded deferred compensation plan referred to as the 1994
Phantom Stock Plan for which key management members and certain other employees
were eligible to be considered for participation prior to 2002.  A
committee appointed by the board of directors administered the
plan.  Final benefit payments under this plan of $9.7 were paid in
January 2006.
        
        The Alcon
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") permits certain executives of the
Company to defer receipt of compensation and certain stock gains otherwise
payable currently and to accumulate earnings thereon on a tax-deferred
basis.  The DCP is designed to permit executives' deferral elections
to be held and owned by the Company in a Rabbi trust.  During the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, certain executives elected to
defer compensation totaling $1.5, $1.5 and $3.6, respectively.  At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, other long term liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets included liabilities under the DCP of $12.9 and
$18.1, respectively.
        
        In 2004,
the Company established the Alcon Excess 401(k) Plan, allowing deferral of
excess employer contributions that cannot be made to the Alcon 401(k) Retirement
Plan because of limitations under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986.  During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
deferrals under the plan were $2.7, $2.4 and $2.4, respectively.  At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, liabilities under the plan, included in other long
term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, were $9.3 and
$10.6, respectively.

        Foreign Currency Risk
Management
        
        A
significant portion of the Company's cash flows is denominated in foreign
currencies.  Alcon relies on ongoing cash flows generated from foreign
sources to support its long term commitments to U.S. dollar-based research and
development.  To the extent the dollar value of cash flows is
diminished as a result of weakening local currencies relative to the dollar, the
Company's ability to fund research and other dollar-based strategic initiatives
at a consistent level may be impaired.  The Company has established a
foreign currency risk management program to protect against volatility of
non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and changes in fair
value caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
        
        The
Company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts in countries where they
are available and economically beneficial to offset the impact of fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and their related cash
flows.  All outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts are entered
into to protect the value of assets or liabilities denominated in currencies
other than the entity's functional currency.  To the extent hedged,
the changes in fair value of the forward contracts offset the changes in the
value of the assets or liabilities.  The changes in value of the
foreign exchange forward contracts and the assets/liabilities that are being
protected are recorded in foreign exchange gains and losses within other income
(expense).
        
        The fair
values of forward exchange and option contracts are reported in other current
assets and other current liabilities.  At December 31, 2008, the fair
value hedge derivative instruments have settlement dates in the first half of
2009 and cover a gross notional amount of $396.5.
        
        Interest Rate Risk
Management
        
        The
Company may use interest rate swaps on certain investing and borrowing
transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce
its overall cost of borrowing.  The Company does not use leveraged
swaps and does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put
capital at risk.
        
        At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, in connection with a long term bank loan, the
Company had an interest rate swap fair value hedge outstanding in the notional
principal amount of $55.4 and $44.7 at the respective year-end exchange
rates.  The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are reported
in other current assets and other current liabilities.
        
        As of
December 31, 2007, WaveLight AG, a majority-owned subsidiary, was a party to
euro interest rate and interest rate cross currency derivative contracts with
equivalent notional amounts totaling $68.0.  These derivatives were
classified in other current liabilities with a fair market value of
$2.5.  These transactions preceded Alcon's acquisition of a majority
stake in WaveLight AG in November 2007 and these derivatives were settled in
2008.
        
        Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
        
        At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's financial instruments included cash
and cash equivalents, investments, trade receivables, accounts payable, short
term borrowings and long term debt.  The estimated fair value of all
of these financial instruments is as noted below.  Due to the short
term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts
payable and short term borrowings, the carrying amount approximates fair
value.  The fair value of long term debt was based on interest rates
then currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms
and remaining maturities.  The fair value of investments was based on
quoted market prices at year-end.

        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements."  The standard defines fair value, provides a consistent
framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and expands fair value
financial statement disclosure requirements.  SFAS
No. 157 does not require any new fair value
measurements.
        
        Financial
instruments, such as equity or fixed income securities, other investments and
derivatives, are presented at fair value.  Fair value is defined as
the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability could be
transferred in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable and willing market
participants within the principal or most advantageous market at the measurement
date.  Where available, fair value is based on or derived from
observable market prices or parameters.  Where observable prices or
inputs are not available, pricing for similar financial assets or liabilities,
dealer quotes or valuation models are applied.  These valuation
techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree
of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market
and the instruments’ complexity.
        
        Beginning
January 1, 2008, financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the
consolidated balance sheets were categorized based upon the level of judgment
associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.  The SFAS
No. 157 hierarchical levels, from lowest to highest based on the amount of
subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and
liabilities, are as follows:
        
        Level 1 –
Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities at the measurement date.
        
        The types
of Company assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equities listed in active
markets.
        
        Level 2 –
Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or
indirectly observable for the assets or liabilities through correlation with
market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s
anticipated life.
        
        The
Company's assets generally included in this fair value category are various
government agency securities, certain investment funds, mortgage backed
securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, foreign exchange derivatives
and certain interest rate derivatives.  Foreign exchange derivatives
and interest rate derivatives are valued using corroborated, observable market
data.  The Company's liabilities generally included in this fair value
category consist of certain foreign exchange derivatives.
         
         
        
          
            
            
          
          
            41
            
            
          
          
            
            
          
        
         
        Level 3 –
Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  These
inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement
date.  Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation
technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
        
        Generally,
the Company's assets carried at fair value included in this category are various
investment funds.  The Company did not have liabilities carried at
fair value in this category.
        
        The majority of the Company's corporate
investments are held in funds professionally managed by investment
advisors.  The net asset values are furnished in statements received
from fund custodians who reflect valuations conducted according to their
respective fund pricing policies and asset types.  The complete
details of the fund holdings of several of the Company's professionally managed
funds sometimes may be unavailable to allow the Company to look through to the
underlying assets at the date the financial statements are
prepared.  Because of these constraints, the Company classifies these
fund investments as Level 3.  For other fund investments for which
fund holdings are available, the Company is able to properly assess the
classification of some investment funds as Level 2 through due diligence,
discussions with fund managers, and examining significant inputs and material
balances in each investment and the techniques they employ to value the
underlying securities within the respective funds.

        Financial assets and financial
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were categorized in the

        Level
3 Gains and Losses
        
        At December 31, 2008, trading
securities were the only type of financial assets included in Level
3.  The trading securities were professionally managed investment
funds, which included fixed income funds of $107.1, a senior secured bank loans
fund of $40.5 and hedge funds of $113.2.  The financial assets
included in Level 3 were approximately 44% of the total amounts measured at fair
value on a recurring basis.  The fair value of the investment funds
classified as Level 3 could not be determined by independent market observation
or through the use of other observable valuation techniques.  If more
than an insignificant proportion of a particular fund’s assets were Level 3, the
entire fund was classified as Level 3, although many of the fund's individual
holdings may meet the definition of Level 1 or Level 2.

Total gains or losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings before
income taxes for financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 were a
component of other, net, in the consolidated statements of
earnings.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, there were losses
(realized and unrealized) of $77.3 from trading securities, and the Company
received proceeds from sales of Level 3 trading securities
of $147.4.  Realized and unrealized
losses during the period were approximately 15.9% of the beginning balance for
Level 3 trading securities and did not negatively affect or materially impact
operations, liquidity or capital resources.

        Valuation
Techniques
        
        In accordance with SFAS No. 157,
valuation techniques used for financial assets and liabilities accounted for at
fair value are generally categorized into three types:  market
approach, income approach and cost approach.  The Company valued its
Level 3 financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2008 primarily using
the market approach and, to a lesser extent, the income approach.
        
        Market
Approach.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant
information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable
assets or liabilities.  Valuation techniques consistent with the
market approach include comparables.  A majority of the Company's
balances measured at fair value on a recurring basis were valued using the
market approach.  Most measurements were market quotes or obtained
from other reliable market sources.  The Company did not use market
indices for valuing material balances measured at fair value.
        
        Income
Approach.  Income approach valuation techniques convert future
amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present or discounted
amount.  The measurement is based on the value indicated by current
market expectations about those future amounts.  Examples of income
approach valuation techniques include

        present
value techniques, option-pricing models, binomial or lattice models that
incorporate present value techniques and option-pricing models.  The
Company valued certain derivatives, in part or whole, using the income
approach.
        
        Cost Approach.  The
cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace
the service capacity of an asset.  The Company did not employ the cost
approach for determining fair value of financial assets and
liabilities.
        
        The valuation approaches described
within SFAS No. 157 are consistent with generally accepted valuation
methodologies.  While all three approaches are not applicable to all
assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value, where appropriate and
possible, one or more valuation techniques may be
used.  Professionally managed investment funds may use a combination
of market, income and cost approach.  The selection of the valuation
method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and the nature of
the asset or liability being valued and significant expertise and judgment is
required.
        
        Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment of Available-for-Sale Investments
        
        The Company reviews quarterly its
available-for-sale investments to identify impaired equity and debt securities
in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities."  An individual security is impaired if the fair
value of the investment is less than its amortized cost
basis.  Impairment may be either temporary or
other-than-temporary.
        
        The Company normally reviews securities
held in its portfolio that have been in a continuous loss position for twelve
months or longer and securities whose fair value is significantly lower than its
amortized cost basis.  Impairment is evaluated using a combination of
quantitative and qualitative factors such as considering the length of time and
extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer, as well as the Company's ability and intent
to hold the investments for an adequate period of time until an anticipated
market price recovery or maturity.  If an impairment is determined to
be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value, and a
loss is recognized immediately through earnings.
        
        The Company determined that, at
December 31, 2008, unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale equity
securities and a senior secured bank loans fund were other-than-temporarily
impaired due to deteriorating general market conditions, particularly during the
fourth quarter of 2008, coupled with the unlikely near term prospects for
achieving a sustainable recovery, uncertainty about future market conditions,
and declines in certain quantitative or qualitative factors.  The
other-than-temporary impairment recognized for the senior secured bank loans
fund also was deemed appropriate to bring a significant portion of the
unrealized losses in line with current market conditions for credit default
rates and loss recovery rates.  The Company recognized losses for
other-than-temporary impairment during the year ended December 31, 2008 of
$36.5.

        Concentrations of Credit
Risk
        
        As part
of its ongoing control procedures, the Company monitors concentrations of credit
risk associated with corporate issuers of securities and financial institutions
with which it conducts business.  Credit risk is minimal as credit
exposure limits are established to avoid a concentration with any single issuer
or institution.  The Company also monitors the creditworthiness of its
customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of
business.  Concentrations of credit risk associated with these trade
receivables are considered minimal due to the Company's diverse customer
base.  Bad debts have been minimal.  The Company does not
normally require collateral or other security to support credit
sales.

        The
Company leases certain facilities from Nestlé subsidiaries which resulted in
rent expense of $2.2, $1.5 and $1.0 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  Nestlé provides the Company with certain services,
including a portion of the Company's information technology licenses, corporate
legal services, certain treasury and cash management activities and certain
internal audit activities.  Nestlé charges the Company for its portion
of the costs of these services based on arm's length prices.  Such
charges were less than $3.0 in each of the three years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006.
        
        During
2008, Lehman Brothers International (Europe) London filed for administration in
England.  At that time the Company's cash and cash equivalents
included $707.0 of short term securities held in a segregated custodial account
of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) London pursuant to a Custody
Agreement.  Nestlé invoiced the Company in December 2008, and in 2009
the Company reimbursed Nestlé, for a total of $5.2 in fees paid by Nestlé to the
Joint Administrators of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (in
administration) related to the release of the short-term securities held in the
custodial account.  This amount of fees is subject to adjustment
depending on the final costs incurred to settle the administration of Lehman
Brothers International (Europe).
        
        The
Company executes certain foreign exchange contracts through Nestlé Finance SA,
Cham to benefit from Nestlé's foreign exchange transaction volumes and
expertise.  At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no notional
amounts outstanding with Nestlé.
        
        The
Company participates with certain Nestlé affiliates in specific cash pooling
accounts under which overdraft lines of credit are available and are jointly and
severally guaranteed by all participants, including the Company.  At
December 31, 2008, the total maximum under these lines of credit was
approximately $418.1.
        
        The
Company is part of the Nestlé Swiss Value-Added Tax Group and therefore jointly
and severally liable for any Swiss value-added tax liabilities of all other
Group participants.

        The
discount rate for the defined benefit pension plans was determined by matching,
as of the measurement date, the expected future cash flows with high-quality
fixed-income securities of the same duration.  This resulted in a
weighted average discount rate of 5.7% as an appropriate equivalent annualized
rate.
        
        The
discount rate for the postretirement benefit plan was determined by matching the
expected future cash flows with high quality fixed-income securities of the same
duration as of the measurement date, resulting in a discount rate of
6.0%.

        The
expected long term rates of return on plan assets were based on historical
market index returns for the applicable asset classes weighted in proportion to
the target allocation of the plan.  The return assumption for the
postretirement benefits plan also took into account the estimated cost of life
insurance coverage and insurer profit due to the use of the trust-owned life
insurance investment vehicle.

investment strategies for the pension and postretirement benefit plans utilize a
variety of asset classes to provide return opportunities that are consistent
with an acceptable risk tolerance.  The majority of the Company's
defined benefit pension plans were unfunded, with the major funded plans
designated for employees in Spain and Japan.  The weighted average
target allocation for all funded pension benefit plans is 15% equity securities,
23% debt securities and 62% other, which is primarily guaranteed investment
contracts with insurance companies with fixed returns of 0.75%.  The
weighted average target asset allocation for the postretirement benefit plan is
62% equity securities, 25% debt securities, 6% alternative investments, and 7%
cash and cash equivalents.  At December 31, 2008 and 2007, for the
postretirement benefit plan, the equity securities consisted of a Standard &
Poor's 500 Index fund and, in 2008, a Europe, Australia, Far East (EAFE) foreign
index fund, and the debt securities were comprised of a Barclays Capital U.S.
Aggregate Bond Index (previously Lehman Aggregate Bond Index) fund and a money
market fund.  In addition, in 2008 and 2007, assets contributed to a
401(h) plan were invested in a balanced fund of U.S. and international stocks,
bonds, real estate investment trust units and, beginning in 2008, commodities
and hedge funds.
        
        In 2005,
the Company transferred $200.2 to an irrevocable Rabbi trust to be held and
invested in an unfunded arrangement for the payment of benefits to participants
under certain defined benefit pension plans of the Company.  At
December 31, 2008, the accompanying balance sheet included net assets of the
trust (cash and cash equivalents of $14.9, short term investments of $218.0 and
long term investments of $20.5) that were restricted to the payment of pension
benefits except under certain conditions, such as the Company's insolvency or
termination of the trust.
        
        The
Company does not anticipate that any assets from defined benefit plans or the
postretirement benefit plan would be returned to the Company during the year
ending December 31, 2009.
        
        Contributions
        
        The
Company expects to contribute in 2009 approximately $25.4 to its pension plans
and approximately $20.6 to its postretirement benefit plan.

        The Company adopted the measurement
date provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective January 1, 2008.  The
Company elected to utilize the alternate transition method to transition the
measurement date for its defined pension benefit plan in Japan from September 30
to December 31.  Under this transition method, the Company charged
3/15ths of the estimated pension cost from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008
(or $0.8, net of taxes) to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008.

        In
certain countries, the Company's employees participate in defined benefit plans
of Nestlé.  No separate valuation for the Company's employees has
historically been prepared for the plans, as they are not individually material
to the Company or to Nestlé.  Accordingly, these plans are treated as
multi-employer plans.  Annual contributions to these plans are
determined by Nestlé and charged to the Company.  Company
contributions to these plans during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $10.3, $7.9 and
$9.4, respectively.  Due to the recent financial market decline,
future contributions may not reflect past trends.  During 2007, the
Company obtained a separate valuation for its Spanish subsidiary's defined
benefit pension plan and converted from a multi-employer plan to a
single-employer plan.

        On April
6, 2008, Nestlé and Novartis AG ("Novartis") executed the Purchase and Option
Agreement pursuant to which Nestlé agreed to sell approximately 74 million of
its shares of Alcon common stock to Novartis in a cash transaction at a price of
$143.18 per share.  This sale was consummated on July 7, 2008, and
Novartis now owns a minority stake in Alcon of slightly less than 25% of Alcon's
outstanding shares, while Nestlé remains Alcon's majority shareholder with
approximately 156 million Alcon shares comprising approximately 52% of the
Company's outstanding shares.
        
        On April
6, 2008, Nestlé and Novartis also executed the Shareholders Agreement that
provides for the expansion of the Alcon board of directors from eight to ten
members upon the completion of this sale, with one of the additional members
designated by Nestlé and one designated by Novartis.  Alcon's
shareholders voted to expand the Alcon board and elected two new directors at
Alcon's annual general meeting held on May 6, 2008 in Zug,
Switzerland.  James Singh, Nestlé's executive vice president and chief
financial officer and Nestlé's designee, and Daniel Vasella, M.D., chairman and
chief executive officer of Novartis and Novartis' designee, were elected to
these two director positions and joined Alcon's board upon the closing of the 74
million share sale transaction on July 7, 2008.

        The
Purchase and Option Agreement between Nestlé and Novartis also contains put and
call option rights on the balance of approximately 156 million Alcon shares
owned by Nestlé.  The option rights commence on January 1, 2010 and
expire on July 31, 2011.  As outlined by the two parties,
these rights grant (i) Novartis a call option to buy all but 4.1 million (or
2.5%) of Nestlé's remaining Alcon shares at a fixed price of $181 per share and
the 4.1 million shares at the first stage price of $143.18 per share, and (ii)
Nestlé a put option to sell to Novartis all but 4.1 million of its remaining
Alcon shares to Novartis at the lower of
Novartis's call price of $181 per share or a 20.5% premium above the then-market
price of Alcon shares, which will be calculated as the average market price
of Alcon
shares during the five trading days immediately preceding the
exercise date of the put option, with the 4.1 million share balance to be sold
at the first stage closing price of $143.18 per share.
        
        The
consummation of a purchase and sale transaction under the Purchase and Option
Agreement is subject to regulatory approvals.  The consummation would
trigger certain change of control provisions in the Company's share-based awards
plan (including the vesting of certain outstanding share-based awards), certain
retirement plans for Company employees and other agreements.

        In March 2008, as a result of the
then-pending agreement between Nestlé and Novartis discussed above, the Company
halted the purchase of Alcon common shares in the open market under all share
repurchase programs, and terminated the pro rata share repurchase agreement that
it had entered into following the December 2007 authorization by the board of
directors of the share repurchase program that provided for the purchase of up
to $1,100.0 of Alcon common shares.  Prior to its termination, the
Company had purchased a total of 150,000 shares under the agreement, comprised
of 112,500 shares from the Company's majority shareholder, Nestlé, and 37,500
shares from the market, for a total of $20.0.  The price for the
shares purchased from Nestlé under the agreement was equal to the
volume-weighted average price for such shares determined in accordance with Rule

was in addition to the Company's pre-existing share repurchase program, under
which, as of December 31, 2008, the Company had remaining authorization to
purchase up to 1.8 million shares.  In April 2008, the Company halted
the purchase of Alcon common shares in the open market under all share
repurchase programs.  In September 2008, the Company continued to
purchase from the public under the pre-existing program up to 1 million Alcon
common shares to be presented to the shareholders for
retirement.  Neither Nestlé nor Novartis participated in this program
and their ownership interests did not change materially as a result of these
share repurchases.

        On July 10, 2006, the Company and
Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. ("AMO") announced a global settlement agreement
resolving all existing patent lawsuits between them and certain other
unspecified claims.  The settlement resulted in the dismissal of all
then pending lawsuits and appeals and the vacation of the Delaware court
judgment and injunction previously entered against the Company on January 20,
2006.  Under the settlement, the Company paid AMO $121.0 in July
2006.  Because the Company had accrued $240.0 in December 2005 in
connection with the Delaware judgment, the Company realized a pretax benefit for
the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately
$119.0 in the year ended December 31, 2006.
        
        Alcon has
joined with its commercial partners in filing six patent infringement actions
against four different generic drug companies.  All of these generic
drug companies are seeking United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA")
approval to market generic versions of Alcon products under what is known as an
Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA").
        
        The first
infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice that Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. had filed an ANDA seeking approval to sell a generic
version of Alcon's Vigamox®
antibiotic ophthalmic solution.  Moxifloxacin, the primary ingredient
in Vigamox®, is
licensed to Alcon by Bayer HealthCare AG.  As part of its ANDA, Teva
challenged three patents covering Alcon's innovator product Vigamox®.  Two
of the patents are owned by Alcon's licensor, Bayer HealthCare AG, and the
third, which expires in 2020, is owned by Alcon.  The two

        HealthCare
patents were also the subject of another Teva ANDA seeking approval to sell a
generic version of Bayer HealthCare's systemic moxifloxacin product, Avelox®.  Suit
was filed by Alcon and Bayer HealthCare as co-plaintiffs against Teva relative
to the Vigamox® ANDA on
April 5, 2006 in the U.S. District Court in Delaware.  Bayer
HealthCare subsequently filed suit in the same court relative to the Avelox® ANDA,
and the two suits were merged.  Trial was scheduled to begin February
26, 2008, but the dispute between Bayer HealthCare and Teva relative to the two
Bayer HealthCare patents was resolved by settlement on the eve of
trial.  Under the terms of the settlement, Teva acknowledged the
validity and enforceability of both Bayer HealthCare patents, and further
acknowledged that its proposed generic ophthalmic product would infringe both
patents.  Teva has therefore relinquished any claim that it is
entitled to market the generic ophthalmic product prior to September 4,
2014.  Alcon remains the exclusive ophthalmic licensee under the Bayer
HealthCare patents.  The trial relative to the Alcon patent began on
February 28, 2008 and concluded on March 6, 2008.  Judgment is not
expected until the first half of 2009.  Should Teva succeed in
overcoming the Alcon patent and secure FDA approval, it would be entitled to
sell a generic moxifloxacin product that would compete with Alcon's Vigamox® product
in the United States well before the 2020 expiration of the Alcon
patent.  Such competition would be expected to impact significantly
the Company's sales and profits.
        
        The
second patent infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice that
Apotex, a Canadian-based generic drug company, had filed an ANDA challenging one
of the patents covering Alcon's Patanol®
anti-allergy eye product.  Alcon's raw material supplier, Kyowa Hakko
Kirin Co., Ltd., holds another U.S. patent that has not been challenged in this
case and expires on December 18, 2010.  The patent that Apotex has
challenged, which is co-owned by Alcon and Kyowa, will expire in
2015.  Alcon and Kyowa, as co-plaintiffs, filed suit against Apotex
Inc. and Apotex Corp. on November 15, 2006 in the U.S. District Court in
Indianapolis, Indiana.  As a result of the lawsuit filing, the FDA
must delay any approval of the Apotex ANDA for 30 months unless the litigation
is earlier resolved or the court modifies the 30-month stay on FDA
approval.  Trial is currently rescheduled for July 27,
2009.  Should Apotex succeed in overcoming the challenged patent and
secure FDA approval, it would not be entitled to begin selling a generic
olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon's Patanol® product
in the United States until December 18, 2010.  Such competition would
be expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.
        
        The third
patent infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice on October 1,
2007 that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had filed an ANDA challenging the patents
underlying Alcon's Patanol®
product.  Unlike the Apotex ANDA described above, which is challenging
only the patent jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon, the Barr ANDA is also
challenging Kyowa's composition patent on olopatadine, the active agent in Patanol®.  The
30-month period after which the FDA could approve Barr's generic product will
expire at the end of March 2010, nine months before the Kyowa composition patent
expires.  Alcon and Kyowa filed suit in the Federal District Court in
Indianapolis (where the Apotex case is pending) on October 23,
2007.  As a result of the lawsuit filing, the FDA must delay any
approval of the Barr ANDA for 30 months unless the litigation is earlier
resolved or the court modifies the 30-month stay on FDA
approval.  Trial is currently scheduled for late April
2010.  Should Barr succeed in overcoming both of the challenged
patents and secure FDA approval, it and Apotex may be entitled to begin selling
a generic olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon's Patanol® product
in the United States prior to December 18, 2010.  Such competition
would be expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.
        
        The
fourth patent infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice late
November 2008 that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had filed an ANDA challenging the
patents underlying Alcon’s Pataday™ once daily
olopatadine product.  The Barr ANDA is challenging the patent jointly
owned by Kyowa and Alcon (described above), as well as two later issued patents
owned by Alcon that cover the Pataday™
formulation.  Of the two Alcon patents, the latest expiry date is
November 2023.  Barr is not challenging the Kyowa patent on
olopatadine that expires in December 2010.  The 30-month period after
which the FDA could approve Barr’s generic product should expire in May
2011.  Alcon and Kyowa filed suit in the Federal District Court in
Indianapolis (where the Apotex and Barr Patanol®
product cases are pending) on January 8, 2009.  As a result of the
lawsuit filing, the FDA must delay any approval of the Barr ANDA for 30 months
unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies the 30-month
stay on FDA approval.  Trial has not yet been scheduled in this
case.  Should Barr succeed in overcoming all of the challenged patents
and secure FDA approval, then, subject to the unchallenged Kyowa patent expiring
in December 2010, it would be entitled to immediately begin selling a generic
olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon’s Pataday™ product in the
United States.  Such competition would be expected to impact
significantly the Company's sales and profits.

        The fifth
and sixth ANDA patent suits were filed February 2, 2009 in the U.S. District
Court in Indianapolis against Apotex and Sandoz, respectively.
        
        Alcon
received notice January 12, 2009, that Apotex has followed Barr in filing an
ANDA challenging the patents underlying Alcon’s Pataday™ once daily
olopatadine product.  Like Barr's ANDA, the Apotex ANDA is challenging
the patent jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon (described above), as well as two
later issued patents owned by Alcon that cover the Pataday™
formulation.  Apotex is not challenging the Kyowa patent on
olopatadine that expires in December 2010.  Because the suit was filed
within the statutory 45-day period, the FDA must delay any approval of the
Apotex ANDA until June 2011, unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the
court modifies the 30-month stay on FDA approval.  Trial has not yet
been scheduled in this case.  Should Apotex succeed in overcoming both
of the challenged patents and secure FDA approval, then, subject to the
unchallenged Kyowa patent expiring in December 2010 and Barr's potential 180-day
"first filer" exclusivity period, it would be entitled to immediately begin
selling a generic olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon’s Pataday™ product in the
United States.  Such competition would be expected to impact the
Company's sales and profits.
        
        Alcon
received notice on January 15, 2009 that Sandoz Inc. (generic affiliate of
Novartis) has filed an ANDA challenging one of the patents underlying Alcon’s
Patanol®
product.  Similar to the Apotex ANDA on Patanol®,
the Sandoz ANDA is challenging only the patent jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon,
but not the Kyowa-owned patent on olopatadine, which expires December
2010.  Because the suit was filed within the statutory 45-day period,
the FDA must delay any approval of the Sandoz ANDA until June 2011 unless the
litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies the 30-month stay on FDA
approval.  However, as a third ANDA filer (behind both Apotex and
Barr), Sandoz would not be entitled to receive FDA approval until the expiration
or forfeiture of a 180-day exclusivity period that would be granted to Apotex
(the first filer) if it were successful in its patent
challenge.  Trial has not yet been scheduled in this
case.  Subject to the possibility of the 180-day exclusivity period
that could accrue to Apotex, should Sandoz succeed in overcoming the challenged
patent and secure FDA approval, it would be entitled to immediately begin
selling a generic olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon’s Patanol® product
in the United States.  Such competition would be expected to impact
the Company's sales and profits.
        
        On April
16, 2008, Synergetics USA, Inc., a microsurgical device company, filed a civil
antitrust lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York against the Company and its subsidiary, Alcon Laboratories,
Inc.  Synergetics asserts that it has suffered losses resulting from
alleged unlawful/unfair practices and seeks a recovery that it claims could
exceed $100.  Synergetics alleges that Alcon has used monopoly power
in the market for vitreoretinal surgical equipment to control purchasing
decisions in favor of its surgical illumination sources and associated
accessories, and that Alcon has done this to the detriment of sales of
Synergetics's products, particularly its line of light sources, light pipes and
other accessories.  Synergetics also asserts that Alcon engaged in
allegedly anti-competitive behaviors.  While there can be no assurance
that an adverse outcome in the case cannot occur, the Company believes that the
Synergetics claims are without merit.  On June 23, 2008, the Company
filed its answer and counterclaim in the District Court.  Synergetics
subsequently amended its original Complaint, and on October 14, 2008, the
Company filed its Motion to Dismiss Synergetics's First Amended
Complaint.  On February 23, 2009, the Court granted the Company's
Motion to Dismiss based on Synergetics's failure to properly plead its
claims.  On March 6, 2009, Synergetics filed a further amended
Complaint.  The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in the
case and is seeking in its counterclaim to enjoin Synergetics from using Alcon
trade secrets that are believed to have been misappropriated by
Synergetics.  A trial date in 2010 is expected, but has not yet been
scheduled by the Court.
        
        A
subsidiary of the Company, Alcon Research, Ltd., filed a Complaint on October 9,
2008 against Synergetics USA, Inc. for patent infringement of U.S. Patent No.
5,603,710, entitled, "Laser Delivery System with Soft Tip."  The suit
was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas
in Fort Worth.  The Complaint asserts that Synergetics has knowingly
and willfully infringed the Company's patent, which is directed to ophthalmic
laser delivery systems having a probe with a soft tip.  In addition to
seeking actual and exemplary monetary damages relating to the willful patent
infringement and injunctive relief to prevent Synergetics from continuing its
infringement of the patent, the Company is requesting that the District Court
award the Company its attorneys' fees and costs.  Synergetics has
answered the Complaint and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of
non-infringement and patent invalidity.  No trial date has been
set.  An adverse ruling by the Court, while possible, would not be
expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.

        On
February 25, 2009, the Company, together with subsidiaries Alcon Laboratories,
Inc. and Alcon Research, Ltd., filed a second suit against Synergetics in the
United States District Court in Fort Worth.  This case alleges
infringement of Alcon's U.S. Patent 5,318,560 directed to aspirating laser
probes, as well as trademark infringement and unfair competition relating to
Synergetics's unauthorized use of Alcon's marks (ALCON®, Accurus®, and
Grieshaber®) on its
website.  The complaint has not yet been formally served on
Synergetics.  The Company will request that the District Court permit
this suit to be merged with the previously filed (October 9, 2008) patent
infringement suit.  An adverse ruling
by the Court, while possible, would not be expected to impact significantly the
Company's sales and profits.
        
        On
December 18, 2008, James M. Nielsen, M.D. filed a patent infringement suit
against Alcon, Inc. and Alcon Laboratories, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Texas in Dallas.  Dr. Nielsen is asserting
that his U.S. Patent No. 5,158,572 entitled "Multifocal Intraocular Lens" is
being infringed by "instrumentalities" sold by the Company, but fails to name
any specific ALCON®
products.  The patent, which expires at the end of October 2009, was
previously licensed to Advanced Medical Optics, Inc.  Alcon filed its
Answer January 12, 2009.  The Answer includes a counterclaim for a
declaratory judgment that the patent-in-suit is invalid and not
infringed.  No trial date has been set.
        
        On January 22, 2009, Elan Pharma
International Ltd. sued two of the Company's subsidiaries, Alcon Laboratories,
Inc. and Alcon Manufacturing, Ltd., in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District in Sherman, Texas, alleging infringement of two Elan patents on
nanoparticle technology (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,298,262 and
5,429,842).  The complaint claims that the Company's Azopt® product,
and potentially other products, infringe the two patents.  The Company
has not yet received formal service of process, and consequently its answer date
is not set.  Although it is still assessing the allegations in the
Elan complaint, the Company believes that it has strong defenses and intends to
defend itself vigorously if the suit is not dismissed.
        
        The
Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of other legal proceedings
arising out of the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating
to product liability and patent infringement.  The Company believes
that it has valid defenses and is vigorously defending the litigation pending
against it.
        
        While the
results of the aforementioned contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
results of operations.  Litigation contingencies are subject to change
based on settlements and court decisions.
        
        The
Company may be subject to future litigation and infringement claims, which could
cause the Company to incur significant expenses or prevent the Company from
selling its products.  The Company operates in an industry susceptible
to significant product liability claims.  Product liability claims may
be asserted against the Company in the future arising out of events not known to
the Company at the present time.
        
        On
February 21, 2007, the Company issued a Device Safety Alert that directed
physicians to discontinue performing all CustomCornea®
wavefront system myopia procedures using the LADAR6000™ excimer
laser.  The alert did not apply to the LADARVision® 4000
laser system.  This and subsequent alerts were issued in response to
the Company's receipt of reports that certain patients exhibited a decrease in
best corrected visual acuity following custom laser procedures using the LADAR6000™ excimer
laser.  The Company began an investigation to determine the cause of
the reports and notified the FDA of this situation.  Because the
Company has not determined the cause of these reports and was not able to allow
resumption of the use of those procedures, the Company decided to remove all
LADAR6000™ systems in
the United States.  The removal was completed in December
2007.  The Company worked with the affected customers to minimize the
impact of the removal and to install other equipment.  The costs
associated with removal of the remaining systems were not
significant.
        
        The
Company self-insures through captive insurance subsidiaries almost all of its
property and casualty, business interruption and liability
risks.

        The
Company was self-insured through its captive insurance subsidiary for damages
incurred prior to 2006 at one of its sales and distribution facilities and was
involved in legal proceedings to seek recovery of its losses and other
incremental operating costs from the third parties responsible for the
damages.  In December 2008, the captive insurance subsidiary settled
its claim against the third parties involved.  Since no recovery had
been recorded previously, the Company recognized a gain in the fourth quarter of
2008 related to the settlement of $15.2 ($3.6 in cost of goods sold and $11.6 in
selling, general and administration expenses).
        
        The
Company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating
leases.  The Company accounts for operating leases in accordance with
SFAS No. 13 "Accounting for Leases."  As such, the total costs of
operating leases (inclusive of any adjustments associated with escalating rent,
rent holidays, contingent rent or rent concessions) are expensed ratably over
the life of the operating lease.  Leasehold incentives are capitalized
and amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the associated
asset.  Lease expense incurred was $76.7, $59.6 and $53.5 during 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively.  Future minimum aggregate lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases with a term of more than one year were as

      AG Acquisition
                
              
          
        
        
        Initial
Acquisition in 2007
        
        On
November 9, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of 77.4% of the common
shares of WaveLight AG ("WaveLight").  WaveLight, a German company
listed in Deutsche Börse AG's Prime Standard since January 2003, develops,
manufactures and markets innovative refractive laser and diagnostic systems,
including the ALLEGRETTO® laser
system for refractive eye surgery.  The ALLEGRETTO® laser
has a global installed base of more than 800 units and offers the fastest
ablation speed available in the U.S. market today.  This acquisition
combined WaveLight technological expertise and the ALLEGRETTO® laser
with the Company's global marketing, distribution and service platform, together
providing additional clinical solutions and laser technology to better support
cataract and refractive customers.
        
        The
WaveLight acquisition was completed pursuant to a tender offer made by Alcon to
acquire WaveLight shares for 15.00 euro per share and with WaveLight shares
acquired either on the stock market or through direct purchase.
        
        The
following table summarizes the components of the initial WaveLight purchase
price recorded in 2007:

        In
connection with the acquisition, the Company agreed to reimburse WaveLight for
the costs to terminate WaveLight stock options held by certain WaveLight
officers and key employees and to retain their services for up to 24 months
after the closing of the acquisition.  The effect of the Stock Options
Termination Agreement is that for each option, the holder may receive 9 euro per
option, in three installments.  WaveLight is obligated to pay the
obligations if it terminates the respective holder other than either for good
cause or for willful misconduct or negligence under the
agreement.  Only the first payment was considered in the purchase
price above because the other payments are contingent upon future service by the
holders.
        
        Purchase
Price Allocation
        
        The
allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of
accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the
identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process
research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values.  Additionally, the Company must determine whether an acquired
entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets, because a portion
of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business
combination.
        
        Although
the closing of the WaveLight acquisition was completed on November 9, 2007, the
acquisition date was effective as of November 1, 2007 for purposes of recording
the transaction and reporting WaveLight's results of operations in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.  The WaveLight purchase price was
allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.

              (in

        The
Company engaged an independent third-party valuation firm to assist it in
determining the estimated fair values of in process research and development,
identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets.  Such a
valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions, including but not
limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process
projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows and
developing appropriate discount rates.
        
        The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was
allocated to goodwill. The goodwill acquired in the WaveLight acquisition is not
deductible for tax purposes.
        
        The
Company believes the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were based on reasonable assumptions.  The
following table summarizes the estimated fair values of net assets
acquired:

        In
Process Research and Development
        
        In
conjunction with the WaveLight acquisition, the Company recorded a charge to in
process research and development expense of $9.3 for acquired in process
research and development assets that the Company determined were not yet
complete and had no alternative future uses in their current state.
        
        These in
process research and development assets were composed of projects to develop new
laser technology in the field of refractive surgery.  These assets had
not received approval by the FDA as of the WaveLight acquisition date of
November 1, 2007.  Because the in process research and development
assets had no alternative future use, they were charged to expense on the
WaveLight acquisition date.
        
        As of the
WaveLight acquisition date, these projects were expected to be approved by the
FDA in approximately 2010 or 2011.  The Company has not determined if
clinical trials will be necessary for these projects.  If needed, the
Company will conduct the clinical trials and attempt to gain FDA approval in the
time period noted.  In addition, these new laser technologies are
expected to be sold in international markets when approved, which could be
before the FDA approval.
        
        The
estimated fair value of the in process research and development assets was
determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow model for
the acquired technologies.  Estimated revenues took into account the
stage of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and
commercialization.  The estimated after-tax cash flows were then
discounted to a present value using discount rates appropriate for the risks
associated with these projects.

        The major
risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of
the acquired in process projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety
and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials, if
necessary, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.  No assurance
can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or
the timely and successful completion of the projects will materialize as
estimated.  For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary
significantly from estimated results.

        Goodwill
        
        Goodwill
represents the excess of the WaveLight purchase price over the sum of the
amounts assigned to assets acquired less liabilities assumed. The Company
believes that the acquisition of WaveLight will produce the following
significant benefits:

                  Increased Market Presence and
      Opportunities.  The combination of the Company and
      WaveLight should increase the combined company’s market presence and
      opportunities for growth in sales, earnings and stockholder
      returns.

                  Enhanced Product
      Mix.  The complementary nature of the Company's products
      with those of WaveLight should benefit current patients and customers of
      both companies and provide the combined company with the ability to better
      support cataract and refractive patients and physician customers.

                  Improved
      Technology.  The combination of the Company and WaveLight
      provides the Company access to improved technology and a highly trained
      WaveLight work force as of the acquisition
date.
                
              
          
        
        
        The
Company believes that these primary factors support the amount of goodwill
recognized as a result of the purchase price paid for WaveLight, in relation to
other acquired tangible and intangible assets, including in process research and
development. The goodwill acquired in the WaveLight acquisition is not
deductible for tax purposes.

        On
January 9, 2009, Alcon Pharmaceuticals Ltd. entered into an agreement with
Novartis Pharma AG (an affiliate of Novartis) providing for the co-promotion
under their license of the Lucentis® product
in Japan.  This agreement has a three-year term ending on December 31,
2011.

        On
February 10, 2009, pursuant to the 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, Alcon's board of
directors approved the grant effective February 17, 2009 to certain employees of
SSARs and stock options for approximately 2.1 million common shares at $87.09
per share, the closing market price on February 17, 2009.  The
share-settled stock appreciation rights and stock options are scheduled to
become exercisable in 2012 and expire in 2019.  The board also
approved the grant effective February 17, 2009 to certain employees of
approximately 420,000 RSUs.  The RSUs vest at the end of a three-year
period, with forfeitures if the recipient is not fully vested at retirement
before age 60.  Alcon's board of directors also approved the grant
effective February 17, 2009 of approximately 47,000 performance share units to
the senior executive officers and other selected executives.  The
performance share units are designed to award additional compensation in the
form of Alcon shares if earnings per share targets during a three-year period
are met.  The final award may be adjusted by a total shareholder
return multiplier.  The performance share units vest at the end of a
three-year period, with forfeitures if the recipient is not fully vested before
age 60.

        On
February 11, 2009, the Company announced that it has initiated programs to align
its operations with the evolving economic conditions and market
environment.  These programs include a staffing reduction of
approximately 260 employee positions that is estimated to result in a pre-tax
charge of approximately $21, the majority of which will be incurred in the first
quarter of 2009.  The staffing reduction is expected to deliver
ongoing annualized savings of approximately $40 beginning in the second quarter,
with the full effect realized in the second half of 2009.

        Report of
the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements to the General
Meeting of
      
        
        Alcon,
Inc., Hünenberg
        
      
      
      As
statutory auditor, we have audited the consolidated financial statements
(consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income, consolidated
statements of cash flows and notes) of Alcon, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2008, as included in the Alcon, Inc. 2008 Financial Report on
pages 8 to 61 and the Swiss disclosure requirements on pages 64 to
66.
      
      Board
of Directors’ Responsibility
      The board
of directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the
consolidation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. This
responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal
control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The
board of directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate
accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the
circumstances.
      
      Auditor’s
Responsibility
      Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss
law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
      
      An audit
involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the
internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
      
      Opinion
      In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2008 comply with Swiss law and the consolidation and valuation principles as set
out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

      Report
on Other Legal Requirements
      
      We
confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the
Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA)
and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our
independence.
      
      In
accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard
890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed
for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the
instructions of the board of directors.
      
      We
recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be
approved.

          Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial Statements to the
General Meeting of
          
          Alcon,
Inc., Hünenberg
          
        
        
        As
statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of
Alcon, Inc., which comprise the balance sheet, statement of earnings and
retained earnings and notes for the year ended December 31, 2008.
        
        Board
of Directors’ Responsibility
        The board
of directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s articles of
incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and
maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error. The board of directors is further responsible for selecting and applying
appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are
reasonable in the circumstances.
        
        Auditor’s
Responsibility
        Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss
Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
        
        An audit
involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system
relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
        
        Opinion
        In our
opinion, the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 comply
with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation.

result of 644,378 (2007: 2,311,746) new shares issued during 2008, the legal
reserve increased by CHF 23,579,424 (2007: CHF 99,484,884).

shares for a deferred compensation plan and 1,043,400 (2007: 7,657,400) shares

        On May 6,
2008, the Company's shareholders approved the cancellation of 7,657,400 Alcon
common shares, which the Company purchased during 2007.  After the
fulfillment of certain formal Swiss law requirements, the cancellation became
effective in August 2008.
        
        On May 9,
2007, Alcon's shareholders approved the cancellation of 7,920,000 Alcon common
shares, which the Company purchased during 2006.  After the
fulfillment of certain formal Swiss law requirements, the cancellation became
effective in August 2007.

        On April
6, 2008, Nestlé and Novartis executed the Purchase and Option Agreement pursuant
to which Nestlé agreed to sell approximately 74 million of its shares of Alcon
common stock to Novartis in a cash transaction at a price of USD 143.18 per
share. This sale was consummated on July 7, 2008, and Novartis now owns a
minority stake in Alcon of slightly less than 25% of Alcon's outstanding shares,
while Nestlé remains Alcon's majority shareholder with approximately 156 million
Alcon shares comprising approximately 52% of the Company's outstanding
shares.
        
        On April
6, 2008, Nestlé and Novartis also executed the Shareholders Agreement that
provides for the expansion of the Alcon board of directors from eight to ten
members upon the completion of this sale, with one of the additional members
designated by Nestlé and one designated by Novartis.  Alcon's
shareholders voted to expand the Alcon board and elected two new directors at
Alcon's annual general meeting held on May 6, 2008 in Zug,
Switzerland.  James Singh, Nestlé's executive vice president and chief
financial officer and Nestlé's designee, and Daniel Vasella, M.D., chairman and
chief executive officer of Novartis and Novartis' designee, were elected to
these two director positions and joined Alcon's board upon the closing of the 74
million share sale transaction on July 7, 2008.

        The
Purchase and Option Agreement between Nestlé and Novartis also contains put and
call option rights on the balance of approximately 156 million Alcon shares
owned by Nestlé.  The option rights commence on January 1, 2010 and
expire on July 31, 2011.  As outlined by the two parties, these rights
grant (i) Novartis a call option to buy all but 4.1 million (or 2.5%) of
Nestlé's remaining Alcon shares at a fixed price of USD 181 per share and the
4.1 million shares at the first stage price of USD 143.18 per share, and (ii)
Nestlé a put option to sell to Novartis all but 4.1 million of its remaining
Alcon shares to Novartis at the lower of Novartis' call price of USD 181 per
share or a 20.5% premium above the then-market price of Alcon shares, which will
be calculated as the average market price of Alcon shares during the five
trading days immediately preceding the exercise date of the put option, with the
4.1 million share balance to be sold at the first stage closing price of USD
143.18 per share.
        
        The
consummation of a purchase and sale transaction under the Purchase and Option
Agreement is subject to regulatory approvals.  The consummation would
trigger certain change of control provisions in the Company's share-based awards
plan (including the vesting of certain outstanding share-based awards), certain
retirement plans for Company employees and other agreements.

      Repurchase Agreement Terminated
                
              
          
        
        
        In March
2008, as a result of the then-pending agreement between Nestlé and Novartis
discussed above, the Company halted the purchase of Alcon common shares in the
open market under all share repurchase programs, and terminated the pro rata
share repurchase agreement that it had entered into following the December 2007
authorization by the board of directors of the share repurchase program that
provided for the purchase of up to USD 1,100 million of Alcon common
shares.  Prior to its termination, the Company had purchased a total
of 150,000 shares under the agreement, comprised of 112,500 shares from the
Company's majority shareholder, Nestlé, and 37,500 shares from the market, for a
total of USD 20 million. The price for the shares purchased from Nestlé under
the agreement was equal to the volume-weighted average price for such shares
determined in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934.
        
        The
program authorized in December 2007 was in addition to the Company's
pre-existing share repurchase program, under which, as of December 31, 2008, the
Company had remaining authorization to purchase up to 1.8 million
shares.  In April 2008, the Company halted the purchase of Alcon
common shares in the open market under all share repurchase programs. In
September 2008, the Company continued to purchase from the public under the
pre-existing program up to 1 million Alcon common shares to be presented to the
shareholders for retirement. Neither Nestlé nor Novartis participated in this
program and their ownership interests did not change materially as a result of
these share repurchases.

        Alcon,
Inc. is the parent company of the Alcon Group and is integrated in the
group-wide Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) process. The ERM process is
applied in strategy setting across the Group and designed to identify potential
events that may affect entities and manage risks within Group tolerances.
Regular reporting is provided to the Board of Directors and Audit Committee.
Organizationally, the ERM process is coordinated by the Corporate Strategy and
Business Development Department and is applicable to all Group's facilities and
operations including corporate functions such as Financial Reporting, Treasury,
Income Taxes, Legal, and Information Technology.
        
        To
address the requirements of the Swiss Auditing Standard PS 890, a risk analysis
was performed for the Company’s key financial processes for which internal
controls over financial reporting were documented and evaluated for existence.
This risk analysis will be assessed at least annually.

        B)  COMPENSATION
        
        We
provide our board of directors with compensation and benefits that will attract
and retain qualified directors. In 2008, all members of our board of directors,
except for our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, received an
annual cash retainer of USD 85,000 with an additional USD 15,000 for the audit
committee chairperson.
        
        In 2008,
the numbers of share-settled stock appreciation rights ("SSARs") and restricted
share units awarded to non-employee directors were determined by multiplying USD
125,000 by 50% for SSARs and by 50% for restricted share units.  The
50% portion for SSARs was divided by the expected Black-Scholes value of an
option to purchase one common share on the date of grant. The 50% portion for
restricted share units was determined using the discounted value of one common
share on the date of grant.  Each of the non-employee directors, other
than Dr. Vasella, was awarded 1,500 SSARs and 425 restricted share units in
2008.  As Dr. Vasella joined the board in July 2008, he was awarded
1,350 SSARs and 375 restricted share units in 2008. In the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007 our directors did not receive any other compensation
or benefits-in-kind from Alcon, Inc. except as noted above.
        
        We have
service contracts with two of our directors and/or nominees. Alcon entered into
a service agreement with Cary Rayment commencing April 1, 2009 under which he
will continue to serve as a director and the non-executive chairman of the board
after his retirement as President and Chief Executive Officer of Alcon, Inc.
effective March 31, 2009. Kevin Buehler was named President and Chief Executive
Officer of Alcon, Inc. and Alcon Laboratories, Inc. effective April 1, 2009 and
has an employment agreement with Alcon Laboratories, Inc. In addition, Timothy
R.G. Sear, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will continue to be
provided an office by the Company through May 2010.
        
        During
2008, the executive officers received a combination of SSARs, restricted share
units and performance share units from Alcon, Inc. as indicated in this
Compensation section.
        
        The
following compensation table sets forth information regarding compensation and
benefits-in-kind paid during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007

                  SSARs
      were granted in 2008 and 2007 pursuant to the 2002 Alcon Incentive plan as
      amended. The value shown is based on the Black-Scholes model of option
      valuation to determine grant date "fair value". The actual value, if any
      that may be realized will depend on the excess of the stock price over the
      exercise price on the date the SSAR is exercised, so there is no assurance
      the value realized will be at or near the value estimated by this model.
      The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes model for 2008:

                  SSARs
      were granted in 2008 and 2007 pursuant to the 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan as
      amended.  In general, these share-based instruments will vest in
      full on the third anniversary of the date of grant, or upon a
      participant's death or permanent disability.  Where the
      termination of employment is due to retirement, vesting will occur
      according to the normal vesting schedule. Upon the involuntary termination
      of a participant's employment with Alcon (not as a result of disability or
      death), all vested instruments will be exercisable for 30 days; all
      unvested and unexercised instruments will be forfeited.  Where
      the termination of employment is due to death or disability, the
      instruments may be exercisable for 60 months not to exceed the remaining
      term. Upon voluntary termination, all unexercised instruments will be
      forfeited.

                  The
      value shown is based on the Black-Scholes model of option valuation to
      determine grant date "fair value". The actual value, if any, that may be
      realized will depend on the excess of the stock price over the exercise
      price on the date the SSAR is exercised, so there is no assurance the
      value realized will be at or near the value estimated by this
      model.  The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes
      model for 2008: expected volatility, 29.5%; risk-free interest rate, 2.67%
      to 2.98%; dividend yield, 1.5%; expected life, 5
  years.

        Eligibility
and Award Limits
        Our
employees and non-employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries and
affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan.
Employees of Nestlé and its subsidiaries other than Alcon entities are not
eligible to receive awards under this plan.
        
        Under the
2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, limits are placed on the maximum award amounts that
may be granted to any employee in any plan year. The maximum number of shares
subject to stock options/stock appreciation rights that may be issued to any
participant during any calendar year shall not exceed 750,000. The maximum
number of shares that may be issued to any participant as restricted shares
during any calendar year shall not exceed 200,000.
        
        Administration
        The 2002
Alcon Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board
of directors, which has the authority to recommend and set the terms and
conditions of the grant awards. Our board of directors is responsible for
approving the recommendations of the compensation committee.
        
        For our
employees who are not considered executive officers, the compensation committee
may delegate its authority under the Alcon Incentive Plan to our executive
officers, subject to certain guidelines.

        Shares
Reserved for Awards
        Under the
2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, a total of 30 million common shares may be issued for
awards. Through December 31, 2008, approximately 13.3 million of these common
shares had been issued under this plan.
        
        The board
of directors has the authority to make appropriate adjustments to the limits
described above as well as to the terms of outstanding awards, in the event of
any transaction that affects the common shares such as share splits, share
dividends or other similar events.
        
        Awards of
stock options that expire unexercised, stock appreciation rights or restricted
shares that are forfeited under the terms of this plan or stock appreciation
rights that are exercised for cash are not included in applying the maximum
limit for our common shares available for grant under this plan.
        
        
        Annual
and Long Term Incentive Awards
        Annual
and long term incentive awards may be granted under the 2002 Alcon Incentive
Plan. The awards are considered earned only if corporate, business segment or
performance goals over the performance period satisfy the conditions established
by the compensation committee and approved by the board of directors. The
performance objectives, which may vary from employee to employee, are based on
one or more financial measures and additional non-financial
measures.
        
        The board
of directors determines whether awards are paid in the form of cash, common
shares or any combination of these items.
        
        Under the
2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, selected executive officers may be awarded
performance-based incentive awards, subject to a maximum limit.

        Stock
Options
        Under the
2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, we may grant to eligible employees stock options that
are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options.  To
date, the stock options granted have been nonqualified stock options, which do
not and will not qualify as incentive stock options for federal income tax
purposes under Section 422 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986.
        
        The
compensation committee will recommend to the board of directors for approval the
number and type of stock options to grant, as well as the exercise price,
applicable vesting schedule, option term and any applicable performance
criteria. Unless otherwise decided by the board of directors, stock options will
vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant, or on an option
holder's death, permanent disability or retirement (as defined in the 2002 Alcon
Incentive Plan). Beginning with awards granted in 2006, vesting of stock option
awards will not be accelerated upon the option holder's retirement, but will
vest according to the regular vesting schedule. Upon the involuntary termination
of an option holder's employment, all vested options will be exercisable for 30
days; provided, however, that where the termination of employment is due to (i)
retirement or (ii) death or disability, they may be exercisable for their
remaining term, or for 60 months not to exceed the remaining term,
respectively.  Some vesting requirements have been modified in
accordance with local laws and the approval of the board. Upon voluntary
termination of employment, all options (vested and unvested) forfeit on the date
of termination. The grant price for any stock option will be not less than the
fair market value of our common shares on the grant date. Unless the board of
directors provides for a different period, stock options will have a term of ten
years.

        Stock
Appreciation Rights
        We may
grant stock appreciation rights, which will entitle the holder to receive an
amount equal to the difference between the fair market value and the grant
price.  The compensation committee will recommend to the board of
directors for approval the number of stock appreciation rights to grant, as well
as the exercise price, applicable vesting schedule, term and any applicable
performance criteria. The amount may be settled either in stock or in cash, as
designated by the award agreement. Unless determined otherwise by the board of
directors, stock appreciation rights will vest in full on the third anniversary
of the date of grant or on a holder's death, permanent disability or retirement
(as defined in the 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan). Beginning with awards granted in
2006, vesting of stock appreciation rights will not be accelerated upon the
holder's retirement, but will vest according to the regular vesting schedule.
Upon the involuntary termination of a holder's employment, all vested stock
appreciation rights will be exercisable for 30 days; provided, however, that
where the termination is due to (i) retirement or (ii) death or disability, they
may be exercisable for the remaining term, or for 60 months not to exceed the
remaining term, respectively.  Some vesting requirements have been
modified in accordance with local laws and the approval of the board. Upon
voluntary termination of employment, all stock appreciation rights (vested and
unvested) forfeit on the date of termination. Stock appreciation rights granted
in tandem with stock options can be exercised only if the related stock option
is exercisable at that time. Unless the board of directors provides for a
different period, stock appreciation rights will have a term of ten
years.
        
        Restricted
Shares / Restricted Share Units
        The
Company may grant restricted shares/restricted share
units.  Restricted shares are common shares granted to a participant
subject to restrictions determined by the board of
directors.  Restricted share units entitle the recipient to receive a
specified number of common shares or the cash equivalent equal to the fair
market value of such shares on the date of vesting.  A restricted
share or restricted share unit will vest and become transferable upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the restricted share / restricted
share unit award agreements.  Restricted share/restricted share unit
awards will be forfeited if a recipient's employment terminates prior to vesting
of the award.  The compensation committee will recommend to the board
of directors for approval the number of restricted share / restricted share unit
awards to grant, applicable vesting schedule, term and any applicable
performance criteria. Unless otherwise specified in the restricted
share/restricted share unit award agreements, restricted share/restricted share
unit awards will vest upon a holder's death or permanent disability or
retirement at or after age 62. Vesting of restricted share awards/restricted
share unit awards upon a holder's retirement after age 55 with 10 years of
service and prior to age 62 will have accelerated vesting of 33% for each full
year of service after the date of award with the remaining shares/share units
being forfeited. Holders of restricted shares will have voting rights and
receive dividend equivalents prior to vesting. Holders of restricted share units
have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents prior to
vesting.

        Performance
Share Units
        Performance
share units vest upon a service requirement and achievement of specific Alcon
business objectives as selected by the Compensation Committee in its discretion
and approved by Alcon's board of directors. The metrics for the 2008 grant
consist of cumulative earnings per share ("EPS") growth target with relative
total shareholder return ("TSR") as a modifier, both of which are measured over
a three-year period. At the beginning of the performance period, the
Compensation Committee establishes a total equity award value for each
participant. The performance share unit portion reflects 25% of the established
total value. The actual value of the units awarded to the employee will be
adjusted based on Alcon's cumulative EPS and TSR during the three-year
performance period. The adjustment will be accomplished by multiplying the
target award by the applicable EPS award percentage and the TSR multiplier,
which may result in an award from 0 to 200%. The compensation committee will
recommend to the board of directors for approval the number of performance share
units to grant, applicable vesting schedule, term and any applicable performance
criteria. Unless otherwise specified in the award agreement, the performance
share unit award will vest upon a holder's death or permanent disability or
retirement at or after age 62. Vesting of performance share unit awards upon a
holder's retirement after age 55 with 10 years of service and prior to age 62
will have accelerated vesting of 33% for each full year of service after the
date of award with the remaining performance share units being forfeited.
Holders of performance share units have no voting rights and do not receive
dividend equivalents prior to vesting.
        
        
        Other
Share-Based Awards
        The 2002
Alcon Incentive Plan also allows to provide awards that are denominated in or
valued by reference to the common shares.  The grant price for the
award will not be less than the fair market value of the common shares on the
grant date. The compensation committee will recommend to the board of directors
for approval the number and type of award to grant, applicable vesting schedule,
term and any applicable performance criteria.

event of a change-of-control (as defined under the 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan),
the following events will occur for annual share-based awards granted prior to
December 31, 2008, if the agreement covering the award so provides:

      terms unless achievement of performance goals can no longer be measured,
      in which case 100% of each employee's awards vest upon completion of the
      individual service requirements.
                
              
          
        
        
        For
share-based awards granted on or after January 1, 2009, the board approved
modifications to the change-of-control provisions. Vesting of future awards will
accelerate upon the occurance of both a change-of-control and either involuntary
termination, other than "for cause," or voluntary termination for "good reason"
within six months preceding or two years following the
change-of-control.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
        
        The
Company adopted the Alcon Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP")
effective October 25, 2002. The DCP allows certain U.S. employees the
opportunity to defer the receipt of salary, bonus and restricted shares. The DCP
further provides that restricted shares deferred by eligible executives can only
be invested in Alcon common shares and distributed as Alcon common shares at the
end of the deferral period.

      stock options and share-settled stock appreciation rights that may be
      exercised in 2009 and for restricted shares and restricted share units,
      less any treasury shares acquired in 2009, all prior to the record date
      for dividend payments.
                
              
          
        
        
        
          
              
                
                   
      
                
                
                  Dividends
      associated with stock options and share-settled stock appreciation rights
      which are not exercised by the dividend record date and with any shares
      acquired by Alcon, Inc. and subsidiaries in 2009 and held in Treasury on
      the dividend record date will be transferred to retained
      earnings.
