(EUR 7.9 billion including revaluation reserve)  Statement Alex Wynaendts, CEO  “Despite the persistent challenges of the financial crisis, AEGON significantly improved earnings compared to the second half of 2008. Although we posted a net loss
in the first quarter, we are encouraged by the improvement in earnings and the indications that the fundamentals of our business remain sound.  “We
continue to focus on freeing up capital from our businesses, reducing costs, and taking measures to counter the effects of the current environment. Consequently, we released an additional EUR 900 million of capital during the first quarter, and
made solid progress toward our target of reducing costs by EUR 150 million this year. The sale of our life insurance business in Taiwan and the decision to downsize our institutional markets division in the United States are but two examples of
our determination to execute on our strategy.  “The relatively stable new life sales and deposits quarter-over-quarter reflect the strength of
AEGON’s franchise and the continued confidence of our customers.”  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

a)
 The
calculation of the IGD (Insurance Group Directive) capital surplus and ratio is based on Solvency I capital requirements on IFRS for entities within the EU (Pillar I for AEGON UK), and local regulatory solvency measurements for non-EU entities.
Specifically, required capital for the life insurance companies in the US is calculated as two times the upper end of the Company Action Level range (200%) as applied by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the US

   Strategic
highlights and short-term priorities      Last year, AEGON set out three long-term strategic priorities:   


1.
To reallocate capital toward businesses with higher growth and return prospects;   


2.
To improve growth and returns from existing businesses;   


3.
To manage AEGON as an international company.  Subsequently AEGON
identified and announced three priorities to counter the challenges of the current global financial crisis and position the company for growth:   


¡
 
 Focus on capital preservation and accelerate the capital release program;   


¡
 
 EUR 150 million cost savings measures for 2009;   


¡
 
 Develop contingency plans for deterioration in financial markets.  As announced last June, AEGON is conducting an ongoing review of its portfolio of businesses to ensure that they meet the criteria outlined in the strategy. On February 17, 2009, AEGON announced it will downsize
its institutional spread based business in the Americas, which will result in lower credit risk in the long run and a release of capital in the near term. On April 22, 2009, AEGON announced the sale of its life insurance activities in Taiwan.
 Capital preservation  In the current economic
environment, acceleration of capital preservation actions has been a priority. The actions taken and plans to be executed are evidence of the financial flexibility within AEGON to manage through these extraordinary times. They include: 
 


¡
 
 Releasing EUR 1.7 billion of capital in the second half of 2008;   


¡
 
 Commitment to release an additional EUR 1.5 billion of capital in 2009, including EUR 0.3 billion from AEGON’s institutional business. EUR 0.9 billion has been
realized in Q1 2009.  As a result of actions taken, the capital position of the company remains strong with excess capital of EUR 2.7
billion over AA capital adequacy requirements at March 31, 2009.  Cost measures  AEGON announced cost savings measures totaling EUR 150 million in 2009. Actions to achieve this include:   


¡
 
 Americas: no wage increases in 2009, staff reductions, deferred hiring, reorganization of agency distribution;   


¡
 
 The Netherlands: reduction of contract services, process re-engineering, general cost savings;   


¡
 
 United Kingdom: restructuring of IT, marketing and customer services, cost containment and savings in distribution.  AEGON’s cost measures are on track with approximately one third of the total expense savings of 2009 realized across the company in the first quarter of 2009.
 Capital management  Excess capital 
During Q1 2009 financial markets remained challenging. Equity markets showed a negative return, the S&P 500 lost 12% in the quarter, and real estate prices also
continued to decline. Except for some structured asset classes, spreads in many credit market segments, though volatile during the quarter and still at historically high and stressed levels, were tighter or stable when compared to 2008 year-end
levels. Volatilities in equity and bond markets were down from the peaks recorded late 2008, while interest rates gradually increased from historic lows. The negative impact from capital markets on AEGON’s excess capital in Q1 2009 was
estimated at EUR 0.6 billion, primarily from lower equity markets leading to additional minimum guarantee reserve strengthening.  The world economic
outlook for 2009 remains uncertain and most countries are facing a severe recession. Though policymakers continue to respond aggressively to the economic crisis, specifically in the United States where most of AEGON’s credit risk is
concentrated, AEGON expects an elevated level of asset impairments in its investment portfolio in 2009. Impairments negatively impacted AEGON’s capital position in Q1 2009, reducing excess capital by approximately EUR 0.2 billion.

 In addition, rating agencies have been responding to the economic environment, revising their credit risk
assessments. In Q1 2009, for example, parts of AEGON’s mortgage-related asset portfolio, in particular securities backed by near-prime mortgages referred to as Alt-A and negative amortization/Option ARM floaters, were downgraded to below
investment grade ratings. The rating migration of AEGON’s US portfolio led to higher capital requirements, reducing AEGON’s excess capital by an estimated EUR 0.6 billion for Q1 2009. AEGON considers the rating migration experienced in Q1
2009 as extraordinarily high and expects it not to be repeated to the same extent in coming quarters.  AEGON has preserved capital over the last few
quarters and continues to focus on freeing up capital from its businesses. Part of the EUR 0.9 billion capital preservation in Q1 2009 is related to the decision to reduce investment risk and increase the asset allocation of AEGON’s investment
portfolio to cash, Treasury, government and agency bonds. At the end of Q1 2009, 25% of AEGON’s total general account assets was invested in these asset classes, up from 23% at the end of 2008. The general account of AEGON in the Americas had
an asset allocation of 20% to cash, treasuries and agencies (16% at year-end 2008).  This investment strategy, executed in the last few quarters, has been
successful in a period of widening credit spreads across fixed income markets, and has helped managing the maturity mismatch as a result of institutional spread liabilities getting shorter as puts have been exercised. At the same time, some
structured assets classes have experienced extension of duration. As a result of this investment strategy, AEGON has not been a forced seller of assets at depressed prices. This strategy has preserved value, even though currently the return on
short-dated and government investments is lower. Going forward, AEGON will continue to manage its credit portfolio actively. However, with current market conditions and the maturity of assets and liabilities of institutional spread business closer
aligned now, AEGON will start to put part of the new money inflows into highly rated credit investments.  At the end of Q1 2009, AEGON had EUR 2.7 billion
excess capital over AA capital adequacy requirements, down from EUR 2.9 billion at the end of 2008. The positive impacts from capital preservation actions and statutory earnings were mitigated by rating migration, impairments and lower equity
markets on required and available capital. At the end of Q1 2009, AEGON had an IGD solvency ratio of approximately 170% (Q4 2008: 183%).  IFRS core
capital  At the end of March 2009, core capital excluding the revaluation account was EUR 16.4 billion, 77% of the total capital base, well above the
minimum target of 70%. Core capital including revaluation reserve was EUR 7.9 billion, consisting of EUR 4.9 billion of shareholders’ equity and EUR 3 billion of convertible core capital securities provided by Vereniging AEGON, funded by the
Dutch State.  AEGON’s revaluation account decreased during Q1 2009 by EUR 1.4 billion to a negative EUR 8.5 billion. The lower revaluation account was
the main driver of the decline in shareholders’ equity. The revaluation account was down primarily due to the impact of higher risk free long-term interest rates on bond values.

   Operational
highlights       
 Overview  AEGON
reported a net loss for Q1 2009 of EUR 173 million, a reversal of the downward trend in net income in the second half of 2008. The loss in Q1 2009 was the result primarily of the impact of lower equity markets, underperformance of fair value
items and impairment charges.  Underlying earnings before tax of minus EUR 22 million were down mainly due to lower financial markets compared to the
same quarter last year, but improved substantially compared to Q4 2008.  Fair value items, which primarily include certain investment classes in the
Netherlands and the Americas, as well as a number of products containing financial guarantees, contributed a negative EUR 197 million to earnings in Q1 2009, a strong improvement compared to recent quarters.  Net income was also negatively impacted by impairment charges (EUR 386 million).  Gains on investments totaled EUR 173 million, largely due to gains on shares and bonds in the Netherlands.  The underlying loss in Q1 2009,
as well as impairments and mark-to-market losses on the fair value items, resulted in a tax benefit of EUR 282 million.  Underlying earnings before tax
 In Q1 2009 the underlying loss for the company amounted to EUR 22 million. Excluding the impact from capital markets the earnings were approximately
EUR 450 million.  The underlying loss in the Americas was USD 88 million. Lower equity markets led to minimum guarantee reserves strengthening and
accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC), primarily affecting earnings in the variable annuity and life reinsurance business. The total impact on earnings from lower equity markets amounted to approximately USD
600 million, which also includes lower fee income due to reduced asset balances.  Underlying earnings in the Americas in Q1 2009 were also affected by
the decisions to lower the allocation to hedge funds and increase the asset allocation to cash, treasury and agency bonds, in order to preserve capital.  In the Netherlands, underlying earnings were down 36% to EUR 72 million, a result of lower technical results in the life and pension business and adverse claims experience in general insurance. Also, investment income declined across
most businesses.  Underlying earnings in the United Kingdom, meanwhile, totaled GBP 7 million, lower than last year, due primarily to the impact of
lower equity and corporate bond markets on fund related charges in the pension business.  Underlying earnings from Other countries amounted to EUR
30 million, lower than last year, as a result of higher losses in Taiwan and currency depreciation in Central & Eastern Europe.  Net
income (loss)  Net income included a total underperformance result on fair value items of EUR 197 million. Fair value items primarily include certain
(alternative) investment classes in the Netherlands and the Americas, as well as a number of products containing financial guarantees.  In Q1 2009,
underperformance of alternative investment classes in the Americas, in particular real estate as well as private equity and credit derivatives amounted to EUR 163 million.  Fair value items also include the under/overperformance on assets held at fair value through profit or loss and backing liabilities of a specific portfolio of group pension contracts in the Netherlands. In Q1 2009
these assets underperformed long-term expected returns by EUR 54 million. The assets backing this portfolio of liabilities were accounted for as fair value through profit or loss and have been replaced with assets accounted for as available for sale
as per Q2 2009. As a result this item will not recur as fair value item going forward.  In order to maintain consistency in definitions, starting in Q4
2008, the net impact of the fair value movements of guarantees and the related hedges in the Netherlands has been included in fair value items.

Page 5 of 40







        
 Previously, differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referred to as hedge ineffectiveness,
were reported in gains/losses on investments. Results for prior years have been adjusted (see Financial Supplement).  Net fair value gains of EUR
132 million on GMWB guarantees and related hedges in the Americas were offset by the negative impact of EUR 135 million from hedge ineffectiveness in the Netherlands.  The fair valuation of certain products with guarantees includes a credit spread in the discount rates, a reflection of dislocated, volatile and illiquid markets.  Gains on investments  Gains on investments of EUR 173 million
include primarily gains on sales of bonds in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, the sales of shares in the Netherlands and positive results from economic hedges at holding level.  Impairment charges  Impairments of EUR 386 million included EUR 133 million on subprime mortgage asset
backed securities and EUR 72 million on residential mortgage backed securities, both in the Americas. The remainder of impairments in the Americas was mainly related to corporate bonds. Impairments in the Netherlands were taken on equity and
bonds.  Tax  The underlying loss in Q1 2009, as well as
impairments and mark-to-market losses on the fair value items, resulted in a tax benefit of EUR 282 million. The high effective tax rate is mainly a result of tax credits and other permanent differences.  Commissions and expenses  Compared to Q4 2008 commissions and
expenses decreased by 13% to EUR 1.6 billion. Operating expenses were down 9% to EUR 842 million as a result of cost savings, partly offset by restructuring charges and higher employee pension costs.  Compared to Q1 2008 commissions and expenses increased by 14% (8% at constant currency), primarily due to acceleration of DPAC amortization.  Operating expenses increased by 8% (4% at constant currency) compared to Q1 2008. An increase in employee benefit pension expenses and restructuring expenses in several
businesses offset expense savings from cost savings programs. Operating expenses also increased as a result of acquisitions in Central & Eastern Europe in 2008.  Sales  Total new life sales in Q1 2009 were down 9% compared to Q4 2008, and decreased by 15% (at constant currency)
to EUR 543 million compared to Q1 2008. With the exception of Spain, all countries recorded lower sales compared to Q1 2008.  New life sales in the
Americas were down 11% compared to Q4 2008 and 31% compared to Q1 2008 in local currency, due to lower universal life sales in the high net worth and variable life sales in the middle market as well as lower sales of bank-owned and corporate-owned
life insurance (BOLI/COLI) contracts. Life reinsurance sales were down as well compared to last year, but were in line with previous quarters.  In the
Netherlands new life sales were up 51% compared to Q4 2008, primarily due to a strong increase in group pension sales, which included several large contracts. Sales were down 13% compared to Q1 2008, a result primarily of lower individual life
sales. Q1 2009 group pension sales were in line with last year.  New life sales in the United Kingdom in the first quarter of the year were down 9%
compared to both Q1 2008 and Q4 2008. Sales were down across most lines of business offsetting growth in annuities. In Q1 2008 new life sales in the UK included European variable annuities, which are now reported in Other countries. Including the
sales of variable annuities in the UK in Q1 2009, the new life sales declined by 6% compared to Q1 2008.  In Other countries new life sales in Q1 2009 were
down 14% compared to Q4 2008 and down 11% compared to Q1 2008. New life sales in Spain rose to EUR 22 million, a reflection mainly of the incorporation of two new joint ventures, as well as higher sales at existing joint ventures.

 Sales through Caja de Ahorros del Mediterranéo (CAM), AEGON’s largest bank partner in Spain, which is an
associate and therefore not consolidated, more than tripled to EUR 66 million (on a 100% basis) in Q1 2009, mainly due to higher sales of recurring premium risk products and sales of pension products following changes in pension legislation.
 In Central & Eastern Europe, new life sales totaled EUR 16 million, down 24% (18% at constant currency) compared to Q1 2008. Single premium
sales in Poland were lower due to a decline in equity markets.  In Asia, new life sales decreased to EUR 12 million as increased sales in China were
more than offset by a decline in Taiwan.  Deposits  Total gross deposits excluding institutional guaranteed products were up 19% to EUR 6.4 billion. Total gross on and off balance deposits for the company decreased by 5% (down 15% in constant currency) to EUR 8.2 billion in Q1 2009. The main
driver for the decline was the significantly lower sales of both institutional spread and institutional fee business in the Americas. AEGON recently announced its decision to downsize its institutional spread based business.  Fixed annuities sales in the Americas continued to be strong. AEGON continues to expect these sales to decrease during the remainder of the year. Variable annuity sales
in the Americas were in line with sales in the last few quarters. Sales of retirement plans in the pension business were strong, particularly when taking into account the impact of lower financial markets on the balances taken over. Managed assets
and retail mutual fund sales were down as a result of the turmoil in financial markets.  Gross deposits in Other countries tripled to EUR 706 million.
Gross deposits in Central & Eastern Europe were up 11% in constant currency. Despite the adverse economic environment, pension deposits continue to be strong, reflecting growth of the business as well as the incorporation of acquisitions.
Deposits in Asia totaled EUR 405 million, a result of the inclusion of the asset management joint venture in China. In Q1 2009 deposits in Other countries also included sales of European variable annuities for the first time which amounted to
EUR 111 million. A variable annuity product was introduced in France through AEGON’s partner La Mondiale.  Net deposits amounted to approximately EUR
1.1 billion, excluding institutional guaranteed products. Net deposits for the company amounted to a negative EUR 1.3 billion as a result of outflows in the institutional business in the Americas, following the decision to downsize that business.
This effect offset net inflows in fixed annuities and the pension business in the Americas and CEE, as well as net inflows in AEGON’s asset management joint venture in China.  Value of new business  The value of new business (VNB) for the company was up 8% compared to Q1 2008. VNB was up due
to increases in Spain and the Netherlands. The internal rate of return is 17.8%, slightly lower than last year.

 Strong sales of fixed annuities and retirement plan sales; net deposits USD 1.6 billion (excl. institutional guaranteed products)
 Overview  The decline in equity
markets in Q1 2009 had a significant impact on net income as well as on underlying earnings (approx. USD 600 million) in the Americas and led to lower fee income in many of the businesses, and reserve strengthening and accelerated amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs in the variable annuities business. In addition, earnings were affected by the decision to reduce exposure to hedge fund investments while increasing the asset allocation to cash, treasury and agency bonds.
 Results in the Americas also included USD 370 million of post DPAC impairments. The impairments pre DPAC were USD 427 million, of which the
majority (USD 267 million) was related to structured asset impairments.  Sales of fixed annuities continued to be strong during the quarter. AEGON
continues to expect these sales to decrease during the remainder of the year. Sales of variable annuities were consistent with sales in the last few quarters. New life sales were down in all lines of business. Sales of retirement plans in the
pension business were strong, particularly when taking into account the impact of lower financial markets on the balances taken over.  Value of new
business was down 13%, reflecting reduced institutional sales, and lower VNB of life and protection, but higher VNB from fixed annuities and pensions.  Underlying earnings before tax  AEGON reported an underlying loss before tax in the Americas for Q1 2009 of USD 88 million:   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from Life & Protection declined 19% compared to Q1 2008 to USD 221 million, and include an USD 25 million
persistency related charge following the decline in equity markets this quarter. Underlying earnings before tax also include USD 26 million of increased employee pension expenses. In Q1 2008 underlying earnings before tax included exceptional
unfavorable mortality charges of USD 34 million;   


¡
 
 Individual Savings & Retirement underlying earnings before tax came in at a loss of USD 403 million, due to the equity market impact on fee income,
minimum guarantee reserve strengthening and accelerated DPAC amortization (in total USD 460 million). In addition, changes in lapse assumptions affected underlying earnings before tax by USD 75 million;   


¡
 
 Pensions & Asset Management underlying earnings before tax decreased to USD 10 million, a result primarily of lower fees from reduced asset balances;
  


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from the Institutional business were down 28% to USD 117 million. A decrease in short-term rates continued to produce more positive
spreads on institutional guaranteed products, offset, however, by spread compression from the higher asset allocation to cash and restructuring costs following the decision to downsize the institutional business;   


¡
 
 In the Life Reinsurance business the underlying loss before tax amounted to USD 30 million, including a USD 40 million impact from lower equity markets
and unfavorable mortality (USD 26 million).  Net income (loss)  AEGON reported a net loss for Q1 of USD 173 million in the Americas.  Fair value items showed an underperformance of
USD 42 million, a result primarily of underperformance of alternative assets like real estate partnerships, as well as private equity, and lower market values of credit derivatives. These were offset by the positive impact of higher interest
rates on the fair value of GMWB guarantees and positive result on GMWB related hedges.  Results in the Americas also included USD 370 million of post
DPAC impairments. The impairments pre DPAC were USD 427 million, of which the majority (USD 267 million) was related to structured asset impairments, including securities backed by subprime mortgages (USD 173 million).

 The high effective tax rate is mainly a result of the tax benefits for permanent differences and tax credits which
increase the effective tax rate in the current overall pre-tax loss situation. In addition, pre-tax earnings from Ireland being taxed at their lower rate also resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate in the current overall pre-tax loss
situation.  Commissions and expenses  Total commissions
and expenses increased 12% in Q1, primarily due to acceleration of DPAC amortization. Q1 operating expenses were up 3%. An increase in employee pension plan costs (USD 43 million) as well as restructuring expenses, primarily related to the
downsizing of institutional business (USD 22 million), offset the positive contributions of cost initiatives.  Sales and deposits  Total new life sales in the Americas were down 31% in the quarter, driven primarily by a decline in universal life sales in the high net worth market and variable life
sales in the middle market. Retail life sales were in line with Q4 2008. The BOLI/COLI market has declined significantly as a result of the financial crisis and its impact on banks. Life reinsurance sales were down as well compared to last year, but
were in line with previous quarters.  Total gross deposits, excluding institutional guaranteed products, were in line with Q1 2008 and increased by 2%
compared to Q4 2008. Net deposits excluding institutional guaranteed products were up significantly to USD 1.6 billion.  Fixed annuities sales came in
strong again after several quarters of growth. AEGON continues to expect these sales to decrease during the remainder of the year. Variable annuity sales were in line with sales in the last few quarters, while retail mutual fund sales suffered from
lower financial markets as expected.  Sales of retirement plans in the pension business were strong, particularly when taking into account the impact of
lower financial markets on the balances taken over. Managed assets clearly declined also because of financial market turmoil.  Sales of institutional
guaranteed products are low, after the decision to downsize the institutional spread based business.  Sales of accident and health products were in line
with sales over the last few quarters.  Value of new business  The value of new business (VNB) in the Americas amounted to USD 103 million, and the internal rate of return (IRR) was 10.3%. Declines in VNB and IRR were noticeable in the retail life business due to lower production and lower
investment return assumptions. VNB in the institutional business was down due to the discontinuance of new sales. The VNB and IRR in the variable annuity business were negatively affected by hedge costs. VNB was up significantly for fixed annuities
on higher production while VNB for the pension and reinsurance businesses were in line with the prior year. Please refer to page 29 for more detailed information on VNB.  Revenue generating investments  AEGON’s total revenue generating investments at the end of March 2009 totaled
USD 279 billion, down 2% from three months earlier.

   The Netherlands
      


¡
 
 Net loss of EUR 41 million   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax declined 36% to EUR 72 million   


¡
 
 Life sales down 13%, due to decline in retail market; group pension sales were strong   


¡
 
 Value of new business of EUR 31 million; internal rate of return of 14.1%  Overview  The Netherlands reported a net loss in Q1 2009 of EUR 41 million. Underlying earnings before tax were down
36%, a result of lower technical results in the life and pension business and adverse claims experience in general insurance. Also, investment income declined across most businesses.  Fair value items underperformed long-term expectations, a result mainly from differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness.  Impairments, primarily on equity investments, totaled EUR 78 million, while investment gains from the sale of bonds and shares amounted to EUR 110 million.
 Underlying earnings before tax   


¡
 
 The Life business reported underlying earnings before tax of EUR 44 million, up from last year on higher investment income offset by lower technical results.
  


¡
 
 In Accident and Health underlying earnings before tax were EUR 11 million, an increase of EUR 3 million, mainly a result of a technical provision release.
  


¡
 
 The Savings business reported an underlying loss before tax of EUR 9 million, due to pressure on margins and volumes from fierce competition in the savings
market.   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from Pensions & Asset Management amounted to EUR 26 million down from Q1 2008, primarily the result of lower investment
income.   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from Distribution amounted to EUR 9 million, below last year’s result due to the slowdown in the real estate market.
  


¡
 
 General insurance underlying earnings before tax were down significantly to a loss of EUR 9 million, due mainly to higher claims experience.
 Net income (loss)  Fair value items
include the under/overperformance on assets held at fair value through profit and loss, backing liabilities of a specific portfolio of group pension contracts held in the general account. In Q1 2009 these assets underperformed long-term expected
returns by EUR 54 million. The assets backing this portfolio of liabilities were accounted for as fair value through profit or loss and have been replaced with assets accounted for as available for sale as per Q2 2009. As a result this item will not
recur as fair value item going forward.  Also, in order to maintain consistency in definitions, starting in Q4 2008, the net impact of the fair value
movements of guarantees and the related hedges has been included in fair value items. Previously, differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness, were reported in gains/losses on investments.
Earnings in Q1 2009 include a EUR 135 million negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness.  Impairments of EUR 78 million were primarily related
to equity investments and corporate credit investments. Investment gains amounted to EUR 110 million and include gains on bonds and shares sold during the quarter.  The positive contribution from tax is due to tax deductable impairments and losses on fair value items, as well as tax exempt income. The high effective tax rate is mainly a result of the tax exempt items which
increase the effective tax rate in the current overall pre-tax loss situation.  Commissions and expenses  Commissions and expenses were down 1% and operating expenses decreased also by 1%. Higher expenses for employee benefits were offset by lower project related expenses.
 Sales and deposits  Pension sales were in line with
last year due to several large contracts sold during the quarter. Renewal rates in the pension business continued to improve. Sales of both single and regular premium individual life products were down compared to last year, following increased
pricing competition in the immediate annuity market, as well as lower demand for regular premium products. Sales in accident & health were up as a result of higher sales of alternative disability products to WIA product. Sales of general
insurance products were down on last year due to the competitive market.

 Gross deposits were down by 15% compared with Q1 2008, due to fierce competition. Net deposits in the savings
business improved significantly compared to Q4 2008.  Value of new business  The value of new business (VNB) increased to EUR 31 million and the internal rate of return improved to 14.1%, primarily as a result of a margin improvement in the mortgage business.  Please refer to page 29 for more detailed information on VNB.  Revenue
generating investments  At the end of March 2009, revenue generating investments totaled EUR 63.4 billion; in line with December 2008 levels.

   The United
Kingdom       



¡
 
 Net income declined to GBP 5 million   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax declined to GBP 7 million on lower fund related charges in the pension business   


¡
 
 New life sales down 9% on lower bond and pension sales, offsetting sales increases in annuities   


¡
 
 Margins and volume in the annuity business drive value of new business increase  Overview  Lower bond and equity markets compared to Q1 last year led
to a decline in net income and underlying earnings before tax. Increases in sales of annuities and group pensions were more than offset by sales declines in offshore bonds and individual pensions. Value of new business continued its recent strong
growth, a result primarily of a shift in business mix to higher margin products.  Results from Variable Annuities are included in the Other countries
section of the results release from Q1 2009.  Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax declined to GBP 7 million, due primarily to the impact of lower equity and corporate bond markets on fund related charges in AEGON’s unit linked pension business. 
 


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from Life & Protection came in at GBP 7 million, slightly below results in the comparable quarter last year. The
continued positive impact on earnings from business growth was more than offset by mortality experience and costs related to the expense management program.   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from Pensions & Asset Management amounted to GBP 3 million, down GBP 25 million, due to impact from lower equity
and bond markets on fund related charges;   


¡
 
 Distribution activities in the first quarter experienced an underlying loss before tax of GBP 3 million, primarily a result of more difficult market conditions
for mortgage and investment products.  Net income  Net income was GBP 5 million, a decline due to lower underlying earnings, impairments (GBP 13 million) and underperformance of fair value items. Investment gains of GBP 9 million, and a tax credit due to the
change in the sources of earnings contributed positively to earnings.  Commissions and expenses  Total commissions and expenses in the quarter were up 1%, while commissions were down due to a change in business mix. Operating expenses increased by 2% to GBP
100 million, due mainly to a release of employee benefit provisions in Q1 2008 and restructuring costs in Q1 2009.  Sales and deposits
 New life sales were down 9% and came in at GBP 265 million in Q1 2009. New life sales in Q1 2008 included European variable annuities, which are
reported as deposits in Other countries from Q1 2009. Excluding sales of variable annuities in Q1 2008, new life sales were down 8%. Including the sales of variable annuities in the UK in Q1 2009, the new life sales declined by 6% compared to Q1
2008. Sales were down across most lines of business offsetting continued strong growth in annuities.   


¡
 
 Life annualized premium production increased 29% to GBP 71 million, a result of continued strong sales of annuities;   


¡
 
 Sales of pensions declined 18% to GBP 194 million as sales of both group pension and individual pension were down this quarter. In addition, sales of
unit-linked bonds declined, primarily driven by lower offshore bond sales (see Financial Supplement for more detail).  Total deposits
amounted to GBP 181 million, an increase compared to last year, on both higher sales of retail mutual funds and third party managed assets.

Page 18 of 40







        
 Value of new business  The value of new business (VNB) increased 30% to GBP 52 million (excluding European variable annuities) compared to Q1 2008, driven by the shift in sales to high-margin areas, such as annuities. As a result the internal rate of return
on new business in Q1 in the United Kingdom rose to 15.0% (excluding European variable annuities), up from 13.0% in Q1 2008.  Please refer to page 29 for
more detailed information on VNB.  Revenue generating investments  At the end of March 2009, revenue generating investments totaled GBP 44.2 billion, a decline of 6% from GBP 47.1 billion at the end of 2009. The decrease reflects primarily lower financial markets.

 Net income declined to EUR 9 million   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax declined by 10% at constant currency   


¡
 
 Life sales of EUR 50 million resilient with 11% decline at constant currency   


¡
 
 Continued strong retail mutual fund sales in China lead to record deposits of EUR 706 million   


¡
 
 VNB of EUR 33 million, down from last year on lower sales  Overview  Net income and underlying earnings before tax declined as a result of higher losses in Taiwan, a lower
contribution from France and lower earnings in Central & Eastern Europe (CEE) due to significantly depreciated currencies in CEE. In Q1 2008 earnings from CEE included a one-off reserve release in Hungary of EUR 4 million.  Life sales were down 11% at constant currency, as declining equity markets impacted single premium unit-linked sales in Poland and in Asia. The strong growth in deposits
is a reflection of the inclusion of the Chinese asset management joint venture. The pension business in CEE continues to perform well in terms of sales and net deposits.  Results from European Variable Annuities are included in the Other countries section of the results release from Q1 2009.  Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax from Other countries declined to EUR 30 million in Q1 2009. 
 


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from Life & Protection declined mainly as a result of losses in Asia. In CEE income on unit-linked business was down due to
lower asset balances. In Q1 2008 life earnings from CEE included a one-off reserve release in Hungary of EUR 4 million;   


¡
 
 The asset management joint venture in China performed well. As a result, underlying earnings before tax from Individual savings and retirement products increased to
EUR 5 million;   


¡
 
 Pensions & Asset management underlying earnings before tax increased to EUR 5 million as a result of the inclusion of a Polish pension fund and the
introduction of DPAC in the pension businesses in Hungary and Poland;   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from General insurance were EUR 8 million, in line with last year;   


¡
 
 Underlying earnings before tax from associate companies declined due additional start-up costs at AEGON’s joint ventures in India and a lower contribution from
La Mondiale, AEGON’s French partner.  Net income  Net income declined by two thirds to EUR 9 million. Gains on investment were offset by impairment charges. An increased impairment of deferred tax assets in Taiwan resulted in a high effective tax rate for Other
countries.  Commissions and expenses  Commissions and
expenses rose 8% in Q1 2009 to EUR 98 million, as a result of higher operating expenses. Operating expenses were up due to the inclusion of new operations in Turkey and Asia, the inclusion of acquired pension funds in Hungary and Poland and two
new joint ventures in Spain.  Sales and deposits  New
life sales in Q1 2009 declined 11% to EUR 50 million.   


¡
 
 In Central & Eastern Europe, sales of recurring premium life insurance declined 5% as strong performances in the Czech Republic and Slovakia were offset by
declines in Hungary and Poland. Single premium sales were sharply lower, particularly in Poland, because of continued market turmoil. Total new life sales in CEE amounted to EUR 16 million, down 24% or 18% at constant currency;
  


¡
 
 In Spain, sales of life insurance rose 22% to EUR 22 million, due primarily to the inclusion of two new joint ventures with regional savings banks and higher
sales of existing joint ventures;   


¡
 
 AEGON’s largest bank partner in Spain, which is an associate and therefore not consolidated, more than tripled sales to EUR 66 million (on a 100% basis),
as a result of an increased focus on risk products and higher pension (PPA) sales;    


¡
 
 In Asia, new life sales decreased to EUR 12 million as increased sales in China and India were more than offset by a decline in Taiwan.

 Gross deposits tripled to EUR 706 million. Net deposits more than doubled to EUR 300 million. The strong growth in
deposits is a reflection of inclusion of the Chinese asset management joint venture. The pension business in CEE continues to perform well in terms of sales and net deposits. Deposits in Q1 2009 include sales of European variable annuities of EUR
111 million.  General insurance  Non-life sales in
Hungary declined to EUR 5 million as a result of continued focus on writing profitable business in an increasingly competitive environment.  Value
of new business  The value of new business (VNB) from Other countries was EUR 33 million, a decrease of EUR 9 million compared to Q1 2008,
primarily as a result of lower sales.  In both Asia and CEE, the decrease in VNB was a reflection of lower sales. In Q1 2008 VNB included EUR
7 million related to the introduction and launch of a mandatory pension fund in Romania. In Spain, VNB increased mainly as a result of higher sales in CAM.  The internal rate of return in Asia was 9.6% as a result of changes in economic assumptions. The reduction of the internal rate of return to 34.4% in CEE is mainly a reflection of lower margins due to higher expense assumptions. In Spain,
AEGON’s bank distribution partnerships continued to deliver high rates of return.  Please refer to page 29 for more detailed VNB information.
 Revenue generating investments  In 1Q 2009, revenue
generating investments declined 2% from year-end 2008 levels to EUR 13.4 billion, mainly as a result of lower equity markets.

 Notes:   


1)

 Certain assets held by AEGON Americas, AEGON The Netherlands and AEGON UK are carried at fair value, and managed on a total return basis, with no offsetting changes
in the valuation of related liabilities. These include assets such as hedge funds, private equities, real estate limited partnerships, convertible bonds and structured products. Underlying earnings exclude any over- or underperformance compared to
management’s long-term expected return on these assets. Based on current holdings and asset class returns, the long-term expected return on an annual basis is 8-10%, depending on the asset class, including cash income and market value changes.
The expected earnings from these assets classes are net of DPAC where applicable.  In addition, certain products offered
by AEGON Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a fair value basis, including the segregated funds offered by AEGON Canada and the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities of AEGON USA. The earnings on these products are
impacted by movements in equity markets and risk free interest rates. Short- term developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings. Included in underlying earnings is a long- term expected return on these products and
any over- or underperformance compared to management’s expected return is excluded from underlying earnings. The fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees of
AEGON the Netherlands and Variable Annuities Europe (included in Other countries) are excluded from underlying earnings.  The Holding
includes certain issued bonds that are held at fair value through profit or loss. The interest rate risk on these bonds is hedged using swaps. The change in AEGON's credit spread resulted in a gain of EUR 27 mln in Q1 2009 on the fair value movement
on these bonds. 


2)

 Net income refers to net income attributable to equity holders of AEGON N.V. 


3)

 New life sales is defined as new recurring premiums + 1/10 of single premiums. 


4)

 Deposits on and off balance sheet. 


5)

 Return on equity is calculated by dividing the net underlying earnings after cost of leverage by the average shareholders' equity excluding the preferred shares and
the revaluation reserve. 


6)

 In order to maintain consistency in definitions, starting in the fourth quarter 2008, the net impact of the fair value movements of guarantees and the related
hedges in the Netherlands has been excluded from underlying earnings. Previously, differences in fair value between guarantees and related hedges, referenced as hedge ineffectiveness, were reported in gain/losses on investments. Results from
previous years have been adjusted. 


7)

 Capital securities that are denominated in foreign currencies are, for purposes of calculating the capital base ratio, revalued to the period-end exchange rate.



8)

 All ratios exclude AEGON's revaluation reserve. 


9)

 Included in other non-operating income/(charges) are charges made to policyholders with respect to income tax. There is an equal and opposite tax charge which is
reported in the line Income tax attributable to policyholder return. 


10)

 Includes production on investment contracts without a discretionary participation feature of which the proceeds are not recognized as revenues but are directly
added to our investment contract liabilities. 


11)

 APE = recurring premium + 1/10 single premium.

Due to the split by country unit on this line, it is necessary to reverse the elimination of treasury shares in the column eliminations, as elimination by type had already taken
place in the column eliminations above as well.

   Notes to
condensed consolidated interim financial statements      Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies  The
condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at and for the three month period ended March 31, 2009, included in Appendix III have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim financial reporting’. It does not include
all of the information required for full financial statements and should therefore be read together with the 2008 consolidated financial statements of AEGON N.V. as included in AEGON’s Annual Report for 2008.  The condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in Appendix III have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention as modified by the
revaluation of investment properties and those financial instruments (including derivatives) and financial liabilities that have been measured at fair value.  The published figures in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited.  All accounting policies and methods of
computation applied in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the 2008 consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the European Union, except for the changes highlighted below.  The following new
standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning January 1, 2009:  IFRS 8 ‘Operating
segments’. This standard requires disclosure of information about the Group’s operating segments and replaces the requirement to determine primary (geographical) and secondary (business) reporting segments of the Group.  Under IFRS 8, AEGON’s operating segments are based on the businesses as presented in internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the executive board which is
regarded as the “chief executive decision maker”. The operating segments are:   


¡
 
 AEGON Americas. Main business lines include life and protection, individual savings and retirement, pensions and asset management, institutional products and
life reinsurance.   


¡
 
 AEGON The Netherlands. Main business lines include life and protection, individual savings and retirement, pensions and asset management, distribution and
general insurance.   


¡
 
 AEGON United Kingdom. Main business lines include life and protection, pensions and asset management and distribution.   


¡
 
 Other countries. Other countries include the country units Central and Eastern Europe, other European countries, European variable annuities and Asia. Main
business lines include life and protection, pensions and asset management and general insurance.   


¡
 
 Holding and other activities. Includes finance, employee and other administrative expenses of the group staff functions.  This report includes a non-IFRS financial measure: Underlying earnings before tax. AEGON believes this non-IFRS measure, together with the IFRS measure (Net income),
provides a meaningful measure for the investing public to evaluate AEGON’s business relative to the businesses of our peers. In addition, underlying earnings is a key performance indicator on which the executive board manages AEGON’s
performance. The reconciliation of this measure to the most comparable IFRS measure is shown in table Segment reporting on page 34.  The adoption of IFRS 8
did not have any impact on equity or net income. In accordance with the transitional requirements of the standard, AEGON has provided full comparative information.  IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of financial statements’. The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity. The statement of changes in equity includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner
changes in equity presented as a single line. In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognized income and expenses, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements. AEGON has
elected to present two statements. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on equity or net income. In accordance with the transitional requirements of the standard, AEGON has provided full comparative information.

       IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and
Cancellations’. The Standard has been amended to clarify the definition of vesting conditions and to prescribe the accounting treatment of an award that is effectively cancelled because a non-vesting condition is not satisfied. The adoption of
this amendment did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.  IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs (revised)’.  The standard has been revised to require capitalization of borrowing costs on qualifying assets. This amendment is not relevant to the Group as the Group already has a
policy to capitalize borrowing costs.  In addition, the following new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations are mandatory for the
first time for the financial year beginning January 1, 2009 but are not currently relevant for the Group:   


¡
 
 IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’;   


¡
 
 Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Eligible hedged items’;   


¡
 
 Improvements to IFRS (2008).  Condensed
consolidated income statement  The result from financial transactions in Q1 2009 amounted to a loss of EUR 7.3 billion compared to a loss of EUR 8.9
billion in Q1 2008. These losses primarily reflect losses on investments for account of policyholders. This decrease of losses is offset by an increase in the benefits and expenses line which increases from an amount of EUR 270 million in Q1
2008 to EUR 1.8 billion in Q1 2009.  Capital and funding  The capital management section, on page 2 provides information on issuances, repurchases and repayments of debt and equity securities during the current interim reporting period.  Investment impairments  Page 6 of the results release includes
information on net impairments recognized in Q1 of 2009.  Fair value measurement  Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities has been subject of industry-wide discussions between preparers, regulators and users of financial statements. The distressed markets continuing since the
second half of 2008 resulted in challenges related to the fair value measurement of financial instruments because of far less liquidity in the market, forced sales resulting from deleveraging activities and asset/liability programs. Assets with a
mark-to-model valuation are now 3.8% (EUR 3.7 billion) of the total valuation of debt instruments held at fair value (Q4 2008: 1.1%).  Business
combinations  There were no significant new business combinations during Q1 2009.  Commitments and contingencies  There have been no material changes in contingent assets and liabilities reported in
the 2008 consolidated financial statements of AEGON.  Events after the balance sheet date  On April 22, 2009 AEGON announced it has agreed to sell its Taiwanese life insurance business to Zhongwei Company Ltd. The sale price is expected to be EUR
65 million resulting in an estimated total negative impact on earnings of EUR 400 million in Q2 2009, resulting in a charge to shareholders’ equity of EUR 300 million. The sale of the Taiwanese life insurance business is subject to
regulatory approval and is expected to close by the end of Q3 2009.  On April 29, 2009 AEGON completed an issue of senior unsecured notes with a
nominal value of EUR 1 billion due April 29, 2012, under its USD 6 billion program for the issuance of debt instruments. The notes, issued at a price of 99.673, will carry a coupon of 7%.

   Disclaimers
     Cautionary note regarding non-GAAP measures  This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures: net
underlying earnings, underlying earnings before tax, net operating earnings, operating earnings before tax and value of new business. The reconciliation of underlying earnings before tax and operating earnings before tax to the most comparable IFRS
measures is provided on page 34. A reconciliation of (net) underlying earnings to operating earnings before tax is provided on page 27.  Value of new
business is not based on IFRS, which are used to report AEGON’s quarterly condensed consolidated interim financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for IFRS financial measures. Reference is made to the assumptions included in
AEGON Embedded Value 2008 Report dated May 14, 2009 and filed on a Form 6-K on August 13, 2009.  AEGON believes that these non-GAAP measures,
together with the IFRS information, provide a meaningful measure for the investment community to evaluate AEGON’s business relative to the businesses of our peers.  Local currencies and constant currency exchange rates  This press release contains certain information about our
results and financial condition in USD for the Americas and GBP for the United Kingdom, because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates
the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about us presented in EUR, which is the currency of our primary financial statements.  Forward-looking statements  The statements contained in this press
release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following are words that identify such forward-looking statements: believe, estimate, target, intend,
may, expect, anticipate, predict, project, counting on, plan, continue, want, forecast, should, would, is confident, will, and similar expressions as they relate to our company. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
merely reflect company expectations at the time of writing. Actual results may differ materially from expectations conveyed in forward-looking statements due to changes caused by various risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include
but are not limited to the following:   


¡
 
 Changes in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom;   


¡
 
 Changes in the performance of financial markets, including emerging markets, such as with regard to:   


 
-
 
 The frequency and severity of defaults by issuers in our fixed income investment portfolios; and   


 
-
 
 The effects of corporate bankruptcies and/or accounting restatements on the financial markets and the resulting decline in the value of equity and debt securities
we hold;   


¡
 
 The frequency and severity of insured loss events;   


¡
 
 Changes affecting mortality, morbidity and other factors that may impact the profitability of our insurance products;   


¡
 
 Changes affecting interest rate levels and continuing low or rapidly changing interest rate levels;   


¡
 
 Changes affecting currency exchange rates, in particular the EUR/USD and EUR/GBP exchange rates;   


¡
 
 Increasing levels of competition in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and emerging markets;   


¡
 
 Changes in laws and regulations, particularly those affecting our operations, the products we sell, and the attractiveness of certain products to our consumers;
  


¡
 
 Regulatory changes relating to the insurance industry in the jurisdictions in which we operate;   


¡
 
 Acts of God, acts of terrorism, acts of war and pandemics;   


¡

¡
 
 Litigation or regulatory action that could require us to pay significant damages or change the way we do business;   


¡
 
 Customer responsiveness to both new products and distribution channels;   


¡
 
 Competitive, legal, regulatory, or tax changes that affect the distribution cost of or demand for our products;   


¡
 
 Our failure to achieve anticipated levels of earnings or operational efficiencies as well as other cost saving initiatives; and   


¡
 
 The impact our adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards may have on our reported financial results and financial condition.
 Further details of potential risks and uncertainties affecting the company are described in the company’s filings with Euronext
Amsterdam and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 20-F. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this document. Except as required by any applicable law or regulation, the company
expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company’s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events,
