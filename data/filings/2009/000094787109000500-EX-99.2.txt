Earnings Forecast for the six months ending September 30, 2009


We announce the earnings forecast for the six months ending September 30, 2009 as follows:


(Consolidated Earnings Forecast under US GAAP)
 
1. Introduction
 
We did not disclose the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 in late April of this year due to difficulty in forecasting trends in the demand for semiconductors and investment plans for semiconductor related capital expenditure.
At this time, we are able to disclose the earnings forecast for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, taking into account trends in orders input received and other factors in the first quarter.  Such earnings forecast is disclosed below. In the second quarter, we expect semiconductor
manufacturers will continue to exercise the same caution with respect to capital expenditure that they showed in the first quarter.  As to the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, we intend to promptly disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes possible.
