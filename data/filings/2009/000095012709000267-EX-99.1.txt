            Acergy S.A. announces investment in new state-of-the-art
                  pipelay ship for operations in deepwater and
                          harsh environments worldwide

London, England - December 16, 2009 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock
Exchange: ACY) announced today that it has acquired the Borealis, a strategic
enabler, which is expected to drive superior returns for future activity.

This differentiating asset, currently being built at the Sembawang Shipyard in
Singapore, is a DP3 dynamic positioning vessel equipped with a 5,000T crane.
Acergy plans to install a 1,000T J-Lay tower and state-of-the-art 600T S-Lay
equipment. It will also be fitted with a range of support systems and
construction equipment for worldwide deepwater and harsh environment operations.
Provision will be made for accepting one of the Company's heavy duty flexible
pipelay systems.

Final completion and operational delivery of the ship is scheduled for H1 2012.
Total costs, upon delivery, are expected to be less than $500m, including
approximately $260m relating to the acquisition of the ship and delivery as per
the original design. This investment will be funded entirely from the Company's
existing cash resources.

Jean Cahuzac, Acergy's Chief Executive Officer, said: "The Borealis provides
unprecedented flexibility and capability, which together with our engineering
and project management expertise, will enable us to meet our clients' strategic
needs, particularly in deepwater and harsh environment acreage.

Our strong operating and financial position has enabled us to capitalise on this
unique opportunity at an attractive price. This investment represents a key
milestone in Acergy's long-term strategy implementation. We expect this ship to
be a strategic enabler to exploit future market growth opportunities and to
generate superior returns for shareholders."
