    Revision
of the Dividend Forecast for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2009
     
    In light
of recent changes in business performance, we hereby revise the dividend
forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, as follows:
    
    1.  Reasons
for Revisions of Year-End Dividend Forecast for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31,
2009
    
    As
announced separately on January 28, 2009, Advantest’s consolidated financial
results for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 showed
declines in all areas.
    Weak
semiconductor prices and the decline in demand for computers and consumer
electronics due to the rapid global economic slowdown triggered by the financial
crisis have intensified the trend toward capital expenditures cutbacks by
semiconductor manufacturers. Due to the lack of visibility in the economic
environment, Advantest is currently unable to disclose an earnings forecast for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009.
    Although
Advantest initially forecasted a year-end dividend of 25 yen per share for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, for the reasons set forth above this has been
revised to a sum not yet determined.  Advantest will make further
announcements with respect to the year-end dividend after considering its
financial results going forward and other factors.
