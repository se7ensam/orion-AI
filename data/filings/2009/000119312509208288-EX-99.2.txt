 seabed-to-surface October 14, 2009 slide 2 Forward-Looking Statements Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking  statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange  Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These  statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the approximate value of the awarded contracts, our  anticipated performance for fiscal year 2009, the underlying market fundamentals, the anticipated
conditions of the  SURF market in 2010, our expectation of the approval of additional
projects in West Africa, our ability to manage our  business through this market cycle,
the expected reduction of our shareholdings in two Angolan joint ventures and  the
expected timing and impact thereof, expectations regarding our backlog and pre-backlog, the expected timing of  publishing our pre-close trading update and statements contained in the “Trading Outlook” section, including the  expected awards in and our continued focus on the conventional market in West Africa, the expected
activity levels,  market conditions and their impact on our margin in 2010, the strength
of the medium-term market fundamentals,  our ability to capitalise on asset opportunities, our ability to exploit new growth areas, and statements as to  management’s confidence of our ability to meet our clients’ strategic needs and to capture opportunities when the markets return to growth. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are  subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our
public filings and  submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are
among those that may cause actual and future  results and trends to differ materially
from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant  projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our  relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or
governmental enquiries;  uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely
delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of  ship conversion programmes; the
impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and  environmental damage.  Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or
predict.  Given these factors, you  should not place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements. 


  


 
 seabed-to-surface October 14, 2009 slide 3 Third Quarter Highlights Result reflects excellent operational performance, strong client relationships  and good execution of projects awarded in previous years when business  conditions were more favourable Continuing operations: Revenue of $558 million Adjusted EBITDA of $110 million Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%  Net income of $65 million  Diluted EPS of $0.29 Strong cash and cash equivalents position of $807 million driven by good operational cashflow New major contract awards: $260 million four-year contract for Petrobras for use of the Polar Queen $110 million contract offshore Angola for Total and BP SapuraAcergy Joint Venture awarded $170 million contract offshore Australia by   Apache, post quarter end Number of smaller awards worldwide 


  


 
 seabed-to-surface October 14, 2009 slide 4 Underlying market fundamentals remain unchanged - at present, challenging  business conditions prevail in SURF market Short-term caution - medium-term fundamentals remain strong Macro economic concerns have resulted in clients delaying the award of large  SURF projects SURF market:  Short–term: poor visibility – sporadic order flow - project awards delayed by clients More aggressive competition and increased pricing pressures expected to impact  negatively 2010 margins Conventional / hook-up market in West Africa: Improved visibility following recent awards Further market awards in West Africa expected in near-term Backlog for continuing operations of $2.6 billion: $600 million for execution in remainder of 2009 $1.4 billion for execution in 2010 Current Market Conditions  


  


 
 seabed-to-surface October 14, 2009 slide 5 Fiscal year 2009: Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 expected to be in  line with previous guidance Subject to the successful outcome of a number of commercial negotiations  in the final quarter of fiscal year 2009, we expect to achieve an Adjusted  EBITDA margin from continuing operations, above previous guidance,  although below the outturn for fiscal year 2008 Fiscal year 2010: We expect that fiscal year 2010 will see lower revenue and particularly,  lower margins due to keener competition for recent and new tenders and  the resultant pricing pressures Company Expectations  


  


 
 seabed-to-surface October 14, 2009 slide 6 Continue to focus on delivering outstanding execution for our clients Remain vigilant – managing cost base and risk profile, without compromising  long-term strategy and expertise Re-orientating resources towards key markets Despite present challenging conditions in the SURF market – our long-term  view remains unchanged Medium-term fundamentals remain strong Clear and focused strategy Well positioned to manage through the uncertainties of the present market  cycle and to capitalise on asset opportunities should they emerge and to  capture the expected medium-term upside Medium-term fundamentals remain strong

 seabed-to-surface October 14, 2009 slide 20 Adjusted EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income  taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance
costs, other gains and losses, taxation,  depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted  EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from
continuing operations.  Management  believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational  strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from
continuing operations have not been  prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the  European Union.  These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison
amongst our various regions, as they  eliminate the effects of financing and
depreciation.  Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to  compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the Group’s performance.  However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the
Group may not be comparable  to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies.  Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with  current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports  filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Accordingly, the SEC may require that
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  from continuing operations be presented
differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented  at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures
determined in accordance with IFRS  and should not be considered as an alternative to,
or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a  measure of the Group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity.  The reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing
operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing  operations is included in this
release.  This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing  operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and
amortisation and impairment charges  on property, plant and equipment. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing  operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures
by companies within Acergy’s peer group  and therefore believes it to be a helpful
calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry.  Adjusted EBITDA for  discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above.  Adjusted EBITDA for
total operations is the total of continuing  operations and discontinued
operations. Adjusted EBITDA (a)
