Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, Inc., said,
“Hiring activity slowed materially in the fourth quarter as many corporate customers scaled back
their recruitment efforts and cut spending in the face of worsening global economic conditions.
The current market sentiment among employers in China continues to be highly cautious and we
believe it will remain so throughout 2009 as companies navigate through these unprecedented and
challenging times.”


“Partially offsetting the effect of the economic downturn on our recruitment businesses, we were
pleased that our other HR related services maintained solid growth momentum throughout last year.
We believe that our ongoing investments in corporate training and HR outsourcing services have
provided us with a significant competitive advantage, enabling us to build deeper relationships
with customers and capture a greater share of corporate HR budgets. With our diverse product
portfolio, premier brand name and strong balance sheet, we believe that we are in a strong position
to capitalize on opportunities in 2009 and beyond,” said Mr. Yan.


Fourth Quarter 2008 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008 were RMB196.2 million (US$28.8
million), a decrease of 8.1% from RMB213.6 million for the same quarter in 2007.


Print advertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 37.4% to RMB59.7 million
(US$8.8 million) from RMB95.4 million for the same quarter in 2007. The decrease was primarily due
to lower average revenue per page resulting from higher revenue contribution from lower priced
cities and less page volume in 51job Weekly, which was impacted by a slowdown in market demand and
reduced hiring activity during the fourth quarter of 2008. Print advertising prices charged in
each city were relatively unchanged compared with rates in the fourth quarter of 2007, but average
revenue per page decreased 28.2% over the same quarter in 2007 as lower priced cities comprised a
larger portion of print advertising volumes. The estimated number of print advertising pages
generated in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 12.9% to 3,452 compared with 3,962 pages in the
same quarter in 2007.


Online recruitment services revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 5.4% to RMB72.7
million (US$10.7 million) from RMB76.9 million for the same quarter in 2007. The decrease was
primarily the result of a decline in market demand and reduced corporate spending on online
recruitment products. Average revenue per unique employer decreased 4.6% in the fourth quarter of
2008 compared to the same quarter in 2007. Unique employers using the Company’s online recruitment
services decreased 0.9% to 57,071 in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 57,565 in the same quarter of
the prior year.


Executive search revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 was RMB2.4 million (US$0.3 million)
compared with RMB4.0 million for the same quarter in 2007. For the fourth quarter of 2008, other
human resource related revenues grew 64.5% to RMB61.4 million (US$9.0 million) from RMB37.3 million
in the fourth quarter of 2007 principally due to greater customer demand for human resource
outsourcing services as well as the inclusion of RMB5.8 million (US$0.8 million) in service fees
from certain newspaper contractors in the fourth quarter of 2008.


Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2008 was RMB94.5 million (US$13.8 million) compared with
RMB112.8 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is equal to gross
profit divided by net revenues, decreased to 51.0% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with
55.8% in the same quarter in 2007.


Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 were RMB88.6 million (US$13.0 million) compared
with RMB92.4 million for the same quarter in 2007. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues was 47.8% for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 45.7% for the fourth quarter of
2007. Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues was 44.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 42.7% for the fourth quarter of
2007.


Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 6.4% to RMB58.2 million
(US$8.5 million) from RMB54.7 million for the same quarter in 2007 primarily due to increased labor
costs from staff additions and higher wage levels compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.


General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 19.5% to RMB30.4
million (US$4.5 million) from RMB37.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease was
primarily due to a RMB9.7 million loss provision related to a third party contractor recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2007, partially offset by higher rental, property management and office
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the same quarter in 2007.


Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased to RMB5.9 million (US$0.9 million)
from RMB20.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The Company’s effective tax rate
increased to 44.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 33.4% in the fourth quarter of the
prior year as certain non-tax deductible expenses, including share-based compensation, comprised a
higher portion of the taxable income base.


Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased to RMB6.8 million (US$1.0 million) from RMB13.7
million for the same quarter in 2007. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the fourth
quarter of 2008 were RMB0.12 (US$0.02) compared with RMB0.24 for the same quarter in 2007. Fully
diluted earnings per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2008 were RMB0.24 (US$0.04) compared with
RMB0.48 in the fourth quarter of 2007.


In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB7.5 million (US$1.1 million) compared with RMB7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation gain of RMB0.6 million (US$0.1 million) in
the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with a translation loss of RMB7.4 million in the fourth quarter
of 2007 resulting from the slight depreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar during the
last quarter of 2008.


Excluding share-based compensation expense and the impact of foreign currency translation, non-GAAP
adjusted income for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased to RMB13.6 million (US$2.0 million) from
RMB28.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per
common share were RMB0.24 (US$0.04) in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with RMB0.50 in the
fourth quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per ADS in the fourth quarter of
2008 were RMB0.48 (US$0.07) compared with RMB1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2007.


Fiscal Year 2008 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for 2008 were RMB860.4 million (US$126.1 million), an increase of 1.9% from RMB844.3
million in 2007. Income from operations for 2008 decreased 31.2% to RMB96.8 million (US$14.2
million) from RMB140.7 million for 2007.


The estimated number of print advertising pages generated in 2008 was 16,512 compared with 16,568
estimated pages in 2007. Unique employers using the Company’s online recruitment services grew
9.0% to 102,562 in 2008 from 94,125 in 2007. Employers who purchase online services multiple times
or in multiple quarters throughout the fiscal year are counted as one unique employer for the
annual total.


Net income for 2008 decreased 26.0% to RMB76.6 million (US$11.2 million) compared with RMB103.6
million for 2007. Fully diluted earnings per common share for 2008 decreased to RMB1.35 (US$0.20)
from RMB1.83 in 2007. Fully diluted earnings per ADS for 2008 were RMB2.70 (US$0.40) compared with
RMB3.66 in 2007.


Excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation loss, non-GAAP adjusted
income for 2008 decreased 19.6% to RMB121.8 million (US$17.8 million) from RMB151.3 million for
2007. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB2.15 (US$0.32) for 2008
compared with RMB2.67 for 2007. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per ADS in 2008 were
RMB4.29 (US$0.63) compared with RMB5.35 in 2007.


As of December 31, 2008, the Company had cash and short-term investments totaling RMB1,074.4
million (US$157.5 million), an increase from RMB1,007.5 million at December 31, 2007.


Business Outlook


For the first quarter of 2009, based on current market and operating conditions, the Company’s
revenue target is in the estimated range of RMB175 million to RMB185 million (US$25.7 million to
US$27.1 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense and any foreign currency translation
losses or gains, the Company’s non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the first quarter of 2009
is in the estimated range of nil to RMB0.10 per common share (nil to US$0.03 per ADS). The Company
expects aggregate share-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2009 to be in the
estimated range of RMB7 million to RMB8 million (US$1.0 million to US$1.2 million).


Other Company News


On September 30, 2008, the Company announced that its shareholders had approved a share repurchase
program authorizing the repurchase of up to US$25 million worth of outstanding ADSs. In the fourth
quarter of 2008, the Company repurchased 136,827 ADSs, representing 273,654 common shares, in the
open market at an average price of US$6.65 per ADS.

support. Also in January 2008, the Company completed the change of its newspaper contractor in
Dalian to Northern Times.

Note Regarding Preliminary Unaudited Financial Information


The unaudited financial information contained in this press release is preliminary and subject to
change. The audit of the financial statements and related notes to be included in the Company’s
annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2008 is currently in progress and
adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit process is completed. As
a result, the audited financial statements may be materially different from the preliminary
unaudited financial information contained in this press release. In addition, because management’s
evaluation of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in connection with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been completed, the Company currently makes no
representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of December 31, 2008.


Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement the consolidated financial information presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of adjusted income,
adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from results
based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and foreign currency
translation gain or loss. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense from its
non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and analyze the
Company’s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the underlying
performance of the Company’s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings. The Company
believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss from its non-GAAP financial measures
is useful for its management and investors as such translation gain or loss is unrelated to the
Company’s core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor impact the Company’s
cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP measures excluding share-based compensation
expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss are important in helping investors to
understand the Company’s current financial performance and future prospects and to compare business
trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The presentation of these
additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as
being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have
been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial information.
