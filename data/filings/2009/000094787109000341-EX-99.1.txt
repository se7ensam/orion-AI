Projected Results for FY2009 (April 1, 2009 through March 31,
2010)
      
      Advantest’s
business focuses on test systems for semiconductors, and relies heavily on the
capital expenditure of semiconductor manufacturers, test houses and
foundries.  The capital expenditures of these companies are determined
primarily by factors such as current or future trends in the demand for
semiconductors.  In the semiconductor-related market, DRAM and flash
memory prices have shown signs of recovery, however trends for end-user products
including automobiles, mobile phones, and consumer electronics remain uncertain
and the possibility of significant change still lies ahead with M&A activity
now underway in the semiconductor industry. Thus, Advantest refrains from making
any predictions on the timing of the recovery of capital
expenditures.  Because of the great difficulty involved in forecasting
earnings in such an operating environment, the earnings forecast for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2010 has not been presented.  Advantest intends
to promptly disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes
possible.

      In the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the global economy saw a continued
deceleration during the first half of the fiscal year due to the widening of the
sub-prime loan crisis in the U.S., and the collapse of leading US investment
bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered further rapid deterioration in
the global economy.
      In the
semiconductor-related market, although excess inventory and price pressures
persisted since last fiscal year, many hoped at the beginning of this fiscal
year that desktop high performance PC replacements and Vista adoption, as well
as demand for home electronics ahead of the Beijing Olympics, would drive an
upturn in the market. However, demand fell short of expectations, and
semiconductor manufacturers continued to take a cautious stance on capital
expenditures, prolonging Advantest’s extremely difficult business
environment.
      Furthermore,
ripple effects of the financial crisis in the U.S. spread to Europe and to
emerging markets in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, which had previously been
healthy. Decreasing demand for end-user products reinforced the defensive stance
of semiconductor manufacturers, many of whom implemented production cuts and
froze or postponed their capital expenditure programs starting from the second
fiscal half.
      In
response to these dramatic environmental shifts, Advantest actively trimmed
costs throughout the fiscal year, and also implemented emergency measures to
improve profitability in November 2008. These measures include reduction of
fixed costs such as, workforce cuts, and reduced compensation for executives and
managers. However, the business climate continued to deteriorate once entering
2009 and Advantest responded with follow-on measures by reviewing
underperforming product lines, acceptance of voluntary retirement from full-time
employees and among others, aiming for further workforce optimization as its
planned structural reforms.
      However,
orders input received and net sales declined steeply compared to the previous
fiscal year, causing Advantest to recognize inventory valuation losses of (Y)
8.7 billion, restructuring costs of (Y) 5.1 billion, impairment loss on
property, plant, and equipment of (Y) 13.8 billion and a valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets of (Y) 45.1 billion.
      Accordingly,
orders input received decreased by 69.1% from the previous fiscal year to (Y)
50.1 billion, net sales decreased by 58.1% from the previous fiscal year to (Y)
76.7 billion, operating loss was (Y) 49.5 billion, loss before income taxes and
equity in loss of affiliated company was (Y) 52.8 billion, and net loss was (Y)
74.9 billion.  Furthermore, Advantest’s overseas sales ratio fell to
67.7%, compared to 69.3% in the previous fiscal year.

      In the
Semiconductor and Component Test Systems segment, the semiconductor downturn
combined with global economic fears sharply curbed major manufacturers’ appetite
for capital expenditures.  Accordingly, Advantest’s results for both
memory and non-memory test systems remained weak.
      In the
memory arena, the much-anticipated transition to DDR3-DRAM semiconductors for
high-performance computers was delayed, while oversupply continued to hold down
prices of DDR2-DRAM, and semiconductor manufacturers restrained investment in
DRAM test systems.  Demand for flash memory semiconductors were also
weak caused by oversupply, and in addition, falling sales of mobile phones
placed pressure on prices, causing capital expenditures in flash memory test
systems to remain weak.
      In the
non-memory sector, strong sales of notebooks and other mobile PCs were recorded
in the first half of the fiscal year, and semiconductor manufacturers in related
fields showed signs of renewing their capital expenditures to increase
production.  However, the demand associated with the Beijing Olympics
fell short of expectations and a recovery in capital expenditures did not occur.
Moreover, the worldwide decline in consumer confidence suppressed demand for
products using semiconductors, leading to a continued weak demand in test
systems for consumer, automotive, and LCD driver ICs.
      As a
result of the above, orders input received in the Semiconductor and Component
Test System segment was (Y) 26.1 billion, a 77.4% decrease in comparison to the
previous fiscal year. Net sales were (Y) 49.2 billion, 62.6% decrease in
comparison to the previous fiscal year, and operating loss was (Y) 28.9

      The weak
results for memory and non-memory test systems also weakened demand for test
handlers and device interface products, which are used together with test
systems. In particular, the downturn in the DRAM market produced a dramatic
decline in demand for back-end test handlers.
      As a
result of the above, orders input received in the Mechatronics System segment
was (Y) 9.1 billion (a 69.9% decrease in comparison to the previous fiscal
year). Net sales were (Y) 14.4 billion (a 58.8% decrease in comparison to the
previous fiscal year) and operating loss was (Y) 11.9 billion.

      Owing to
a decline in demand for maintenance services, and reflecting the weak
performance of the semiconductor market, resulting from the depressed
semiconductor related market, orders input received in the Services, Support and
Other segment was (Y) 15.6 billion, a 19.1% decline in comparison to the
previous fiscal year. Net sales were (Y) 15.8 billion (a 18.2% decrease in
comparison to the previous fiscal year) and operating loss was (Y) 1.1
billion.
      
      2)
Prospects for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
      Despite
economic and employment stimulus packages recently announced by many countries
to counter the global economic slowdown, the timing of the recovery remains
uncertain and visibility is still limited.
      In the
semiconductor-related market, DRAM and flash memory prices have shown signs of
recovery, however trends in demand for end-user products including automobiles,
mobile phones, and consumer electronics remain uncertain and the possibility of
significant change still lies ahead with M&A activity now underway in the
semiconductor industry. Thus, Advantest refrains from making any predictions on
the timing of the recovery of capital expenditures.
      In this
operating environment, Advantest will focus on deriving efficiency gains in its
research and development and manufacturing processes by consolidating
subsidiaries, reduction of fixed costs through the consolidation and sale of
business offices and other facilities, improvement of the productivity of
in-house processes, reinforcement of the Advantest Group’s sales structure, and
development of in new products and entry into new businesses.

Financial Condition
      1)
Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets
      Total
assets at the end of FY2008 was (Y) 202.1 billion, a decrease of (Y) 96.6
billion compared to the previous fiscal year, due primarily to a decrease of (Y)
41.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of (Y) 19.7 billion in
trade receivables, a decrease of (Y) 18.5 billion in deferred tax assets and an
increase of (Y) 25.1 billion in short-term investments.  The amount of
total liabilities was (Y) 38.4 billion, a decrease of (Y) 6.1 billion compared
to the end of the previous fiscal year, due primarily to a decrease of (Y) 7.0
billion in trade accounts payable. Shareholders’ equity was (Y) 163.6
billion.  Equity to assets ratio was 81.0%, a decrease of 4.1
percentage point compared to the previous fiscal year.
      
      2) Cash
Flow Condition
      Cash and
cash equivalents held at the end of FY2008 were (Y) 105.5 billion, a decrease of
(Y) 41.9 billion from previous fiscal year.
      Significant
cash flows during this fiscal year and their causes are described
below.
      Net cash
provided by operating activities was (Y) 2.4 billion.  This amount was
primarily attributable to a decrease of (Y) 19.3 billion in trade receivables, a
decrease of (Y) 17.8 billion in inventories and an adjustment of noncash items
such as depreciation and amortization, despite the net loss being (Y) 74.9
billion.

of (Y) 26.2 billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount
of (Y) 4.9 billion.
      Net cash
used in financing activities was (Y) 8.9 billion.  This amount was
primarily attributable to dividend payments.

      (3) Basic
Policy on Distribution of Profits and Distribution for FY2008 and Distribution
Forecast for FY2009
      Based on
the premise that long-term and continued growth in corporate value is
fundamental to the creation of shareholder value, Advantest deems the consistent
distribution of profits to be the most important management
priority.  Accordingly, Advantest engages in active distribution of
profits based on consolidated business performance.
      With
respect to the distribution of retained earnings, Advantest makes payout
decisions after taking into consideration consolidated business performance,
financial conditions, as well as the need for strategic investment for
mid-to-long-term business development.  While aiming to make
consistent distributions, because of the fluctuation of the market in which it
operates, Advantest makes dividend payouts following a target payout ratio of
20% or more.
      Retained
earnings are devoted to research and development, streamlining efforts, overseas
expansion, investments in new businesses and resources for M&A activities,
with an aim to strengthen Advantest’s business position and enhance its
corporate value.
      In order
to maintain capital strategies responsive to changes in the operating
environment, Advantest will repurchase its own shares from time to time through
taking into account factors such as trends in stock price, capital efficiency
and cash flow.
      In this
fiscal year, Advantest decided, pursuant to the above profit distribution
policy, to distribute a year end dividend of (Y) 5 consistent with the revised
forecast announced on February 25, 2009, with a payment date of June 2, 2009.
Since Advantest paid an interim dividend of (Y) 25 on December 1, 2008, the
total dividend per share for the fiscal year will be (Y) 30.
      Advantest
has elected not to publish a dividend forecast for fiscal 2009 at this time, due
to the Company’s view that its results will take time to recover, as explicated
in the prospects section above. Payout decisions will take future results into
consideration and will be announced when they are available.

Management Policy
      
      (1)
Advantest’s Basic Management Policy
      Advantest
has established a corporate vision of “Technology Support on the Leading Edge”,
and its corporate mission of “Quest for the Essence”.  Guided by these
principles, Advantest respects each of its stakeholders, strives to maintain
harmony with society, and aims for the sustained development of the Company and
the improvement of corporate value while contributing to the goal of a
sustainable society.
      
      (2)
Target Financial Index
      Advantest
applies the “AVA” (Advantest Value Added), a financial index incorporating the
concept of EVA®(Economic
Value Added) *, as a significant management indicator, along with profit margin,
ROE and cash flows.  Specifically, Advantest will set the minimum
return-on-investment ratio (“hurdle rate”) for evaluating AVA at 8% and a
mid-term target at 12% or more with an aim to further enhance corporate value
and shareholder value.
      *”EVA®”
is a registered trademark of Stern Stewart & Co.
      
      (3)
Mid-and-Long-term Business Strategy and Issues to be Addressed
      While
maintaining “Measurements” as our core competence in mid-and-long term,
Advantest intends to improve its corporate value by establishing a management
and financial structure that responds timely to changes in the global market,
and by aiming to increase market share by introducing fine products that will
inspire the market demands of the next generation.  To achieve these
objectives, Advantest promotes to further strengthen its product development
operations and improve production efficiency by focusing on certain businesses,
while strengthening its overseas operations and support system in the U.S.,
Europe and Asia.
      Confronting
deepening capital spending cuts by semiconductor manufacturers and the likely
prolongation of Advantest’s weakened operating environment, the Company has
announced the following plans for structural reforms to strengthen management
practices, workforce optimization targeted to reinforce management structure,
the merger of four manufacturing subsidiaries into one, the merger likewise of
four software subsidiaries into one, ongoing review of underperforming business
segments, exploration of and investment into new businesses, payroll cost
reductions, and the consolidation and sale of facilities.
      Through
“Activate 21,” a corporate initiative launched in October 2005, Advantest has
pursued greater efficiency, cost savings, and financial health from a global
perspective. The initiative concluded in March 2009, with positive results
including productivity improvements from the just-in-time (“JIT”) production
system, inventory optimization, and standardization of design specifications
leading to enhanced research and development efficiency. The Company’s new
corporate initiative, starting from fiscal 2009, will incorporate detailed
measures and goals after the structural reforms that Advantest is currently
carrying out.

the Consolidated
            Financial
Statements
            
            (a)
Terminology, Form and Method of Preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements
            Advantest
Corporation prepares these consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the accounting principles, procedures, terminology, form and method of
preparation required in the United States of America in connection with its
issuance of American Depository Shares as established under Accounting Research
Bulletins (“ARB”), Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) statements, Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) and other relevant sources (collectively
“U.S. GAAP”).  However, Advantest Corporation and its consolidated
subsidiaries prepare their unconsolidated financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the country of their
domicile.  Certain adjustments and reclassifications have been
incorporated in the accompanying non-consolidated financial statements to
present them in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
            
            (b)
Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Registration with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission
            Advantest
Corporation became listed on the New York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2001
(local time) by means of an issuance of American Depository Shares, and has been
filing a Form 20-F (equivalent to the Annual Securities Report in Japan) with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since FY2001.  Advantest
prepares the consolidated financial statements in its Form 20-F in accordance
with U.S. GAAP.
            
            (c) Scope
of Consolidation and Application of the Equity Method
            Advantest’s
consolidated financial statements include financial statements of Advantest
Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries.  With respect to
variable interest entities as provided in the U.S. Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) – “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities”, Advantest does not have any such entity to be
included in its consolidated financial statements.  All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
            
            The
following table sets forth the number of consolidated subsidiaries and equity
method affiliates of Advantest:

            (Note
2)    Significant Accounting Policies
            (Accounting
Changes)
            In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS157”) which defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value
measurement disclosure.  SFAS 157 does not expand the use of fair
value to any new circumstances, but does require additional disclosures in both
annual and quarterly reports. Advantest adopted SFAS 157 and its related
amendments for financial assets and liabilities on April 1, 2008. The adoption
of SFAS 157 did not have a significant impact on its consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.  SFAS 157 will be effective for
non-financial assets and liabilities in financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2008 and is required to be adopted by
Advantest in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2009.
            
            There are
no other changes pertaining to accounting policies other than as mentioned above
from the fiscal year 2007 Annual Report which was submitted on June 26,
2008.

      Advantest

      with
accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.)

Changes in accounting principles
      1.
Accounting standard for measurement of inventories
      Because
Advantest has applied the “Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories”
(Accounting Standards Board of Japan Statement No. 9 issued July 5, 2006 (“ASBJ
9”)) effective from the current fiscal year, inventories are stated at cost
determined principally by the gross average method (book value of inventories
stated in the balance sheet are written down in accordance with decreased
profitability).  The adoption of ASBJ 9 did not have a material impact
on Advantest’s non-consolidated profit and loss.
      
      2.
Accounting standard for lease transactions
      Effective
from the current fiscal year, Advantest has adopted the “Accounting Standard for
Lease Transactions” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan Statement No. 13 issued
June 17, 1993, (First Division of the Business Accounting Council), revised
March 30, 2007) and the “Implementation Guidance on the Accounting Standard for
Lease Transactions” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan Implementation Guidance
No. 16 issued January 18, 1994, (Japanese Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, Accounting System Committee), revised March 30,
2007).  Accordingly, lease transactions apply the same accounting
treatment as used in ordinary sales transactions.  With respect to
finance lease transactions which do not transfer ownership of the property to
the lessee that commenced on or before March 31, 2008, Advantest will continue
to apply the same accounting treatment as used in ordinary sales transactions,
as previously used.  Because Advantest has no lease transactions that
commenced after April 1, 2008 that would necessitate the application of the
accounting treatment based on ordinary sales transactions, the adoption of this
accounting standard did not have a material impact on Advantest’s
non-consolidated profit and loss.
