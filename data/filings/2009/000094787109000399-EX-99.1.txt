Announces Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation
    
    Tokyo
–May 26, 2009 – Advantest Corporation (the “Company”) resolved at a meeting of
its Board of Directors today to submit to its shareholders a proposal to amend
its Articles of Incorporation.  The proposal will be made at the
Company’s 67th ordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Shareholders’
Meeting”) to be held on June 25, 2009.
    
    
      
          
            
              1.
            
            
              Reason
      for amendments:
            
          
      
    
     
    In
accordance with the implementation of the “Law for Amendments to the Law
Concerning Book-Entry Transfer of Corporate Bonds and Other Securities for the
Purpose of Streamlining the Settlements of Trades of Stocks and Other
Securities” (Law No. 88 of 2004, the “Settlement Rationalization Law”) on
January 5, 2009, the shares of all listed companies have been transferred to a
book-entry transfer system (the “Paperless System”).
     
    The
proposed amendments will delete all references pertaining to share certificates,
beneficial shareholders and the beneficial shareholders’ register, which have
become redundant as a result of the changes described above, and make such other
necessary changes to the Articles of Incorporation of the
Company.  Furthermore, the proposed amendments will establish
supplementary provisions necessary to establish the lost shares register that
the Company is required to implement and maintain for a period of one year from
the day following the day on which the Settlement Rationalization Law was
implemented.
     
    Pursuant
to Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the supplementary provisions of the Settlement
Rationalization Law, the Company is deemed to have passed a resolution
abolishing Paragraph 1 of Article 6 (Issuance of Share Certificates and
Their Denominations) of the current Articles of Incorporation as of
January 5, 2009.
