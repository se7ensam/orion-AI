 seabed-to-surface July 15, 2009 slide 2 Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this presentation may include “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E
of the US  Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements may be identified by
the use of  words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions.  The forward- looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties.  The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public 
filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among 
those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially from our 
forward-looking statements: the general economic conditions and competition in the 
markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the
 outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries;
uncertainties  inherent in operating internationally; the impact of laws and
regulations; and operating  hazards, including spills and environmental damage. 
Many of these factors are beyond  our ability to control or predict.  Given these
factors, you should not place undue reliance  on the forward-looking
statements.

 seabed-to-surface July 15, 2009 slide 18 Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA:   taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance
costs, other gains and losses, taxation,        depreciation  and amortisation  and  adjusted  to exclude investment income and
impairment of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted     EBITDA margin
from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations.  Management       believes that Adjusted EBITDA and  Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are
important indicators of our operational             strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from
continuing operations have not been      prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as endorsed for use in the         European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst
our various regions, as they          eliminate
the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to  compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts
following the Group’s performance.                However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the
Group may not be comparable       to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with          current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) that apply to reports       filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin        from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented
in this release, or not be presented         at all.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS       and should not be considered  as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as
determined  in ccordance with IFRS), as a  measure of the Group’s operating
results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the       Group’s liquidity. The reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing
operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing  operations is included in this release.
This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing                    operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and
amortisation and impairment charges         on
property, plant and equipment. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted  EBITDA  from continuing              operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures
by companies within Acergy’s peer group        and
therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for                 discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total
operations is the total of continuing       operations and
discontinued operations.    (a) The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest,
income
