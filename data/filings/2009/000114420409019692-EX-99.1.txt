    “2008
marked another major milestone in A-Power’s history. Despite the challenging
conditions in the global market, our DG business continued to demonstrate
accelerated growth as Chinese industrial plants embraced our
electricity-generation systems to conserve energy and reduce pollution,” Mr.
Jinxiang Lu, A-Power's Chairman and CEO commented. "We are very pleased that we
have nearly tripled our net income and almost doubled our revenue in the fourth
quarter. We continue to prove our ability to win customers, improve
profitability, and strengthen our balance sheet.”
    
    Mr. Lu
continued, “In 2008, we also successfully solidified our partnerships with
European wind turbine makers Fuhrlander and Norwin, and established our
relationship with General Electric to prepare for our expansion in the Chinese
wind turbine market. In addition, we recently completed our general assembly
facility for wind turbines in Shenyang, China and now have the largest
production capacity for one single location in China. After China posted robust
growth rates in wind turbine installation from 6GW in 2007 to 12GW in 2008, the
Chinese government recently unveiled another ambitious plan to invest $11.7
billion (RMB 80 billion) in expanding the wind energy market to 30GW and
requiring utility companies to generate 15% of their power from wind by 2010. As
we believe many Chinese domestic wind turbine producers are facing technological
barriers and component shortages in their mega-watt class turbine production,
A-Power, with its European and U.S. relationships, is well positioned to gain
market share.”
    
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
          
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
    
    Fourth
Quarter 2008 Results
    
    For the
three months ended December 31, 2008, A-Power's revenues rose 93.5% to $81.4
million from the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the strong growth of DG
orders year-over-year.
    
    Gross
profit rose 207.5% to $14.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2007. Gross
margin was 17.8%, compared with 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2007.

million in the fourth quarter of 2007. G&A as a percentage of revenue was
4.6%, compared with 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2007. The higher G&A
expenses were mainly because of the costs of being a public company and business
expansion.
    
    Operating
income increased 192.6% to $10.8 million from the fourth quarter of
2007.
    
    Net
income rose 197.8% to $10.0 million from the fourth quarter of
2007.
    
    Diluted
earnings per share were $0.30, compared with $0.25 in the fourth quarter of
2007. For the fourth quarter of 2008, the weighted average number of shares on a

income soared 87.4% to $28.5 million from 2007.

    Recent
Developments
    
    On March
5, 2009, the Company announced it had signed agreements for GE Drivetrain
Technologies to supply A-Power with 2.7MW wind turbine gearboxes and to
establish a Joint Venture partnership for a wind turbine gearbox manufacturing
plant in China.
    
    On
January 11, 2009, the Company celebrated the launch of its first wind turbine
production facility with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Strategically located in
Shenyang, one of China’s largest industrial hubs, the facility is the largest
wind turbine production plant in China, with total annual production capacity of
over 1,125MW. Among the guests at the opening ceremony were various provincial
and local government officials, GE Drivetrain executives, the management from
German Fuhrlander, from which the Company has an exclusive licensing agreement
in China for 2.7MW wind turbines, as well as various investors in the
Company.
    
    
    Business
Outlook
    
    The
Company expects revenues and net income for 2009 to be $290 million and $29
million, respectively. These targets are based on the Company's current DG
backlogs, which are subject to change when the company signs new DG contracts
and/or recognizes revenues from wind turbine sales during 2009.
    
    Mr. Lu
concluded, “Entering 2009, we expect continued growth in our DG business as our
strong track record attracts more industrial companies to use our systems to
improve their electricity power management and utility cost control. On the wind
turbine generator front, we want to fully leverage our technology partnerships
with global wind technology leaders like Fuhrlander, Norwin and GE. Although our
wind power business is still in its infancy, we see strong demand from the
market for our 2.7MW wind turbines, as China is graduating from the Kilo-Watt
class and moving towards Mega-Watt wind turbines. With our engineers and
technicians completing training in Germany, our top priority is to secure
components and ramp up production to satisfy the growing market
demand.”

within the 'safe harbor' provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends,"
"plans," "believes," "estimates," and other similar statements. Statements that
are not historical facts, including statements relating to anticipated future
earnings, margins, and other operating results, future growth, construction
plans and anticipated capacities, production schedules and entry into expanded
markets are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements, based
upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management, are subject to
risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially
from the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, the risk
that: If we fail to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete
successfully with existing or new competitors, our business prospects and
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected; inclement
weather conditions could adversely affect our operating results in particular
quarters and/or fiscal years; we may experience construction and development
delays on our projects which could adversely affect our financial condition and
operating results; the development of our wind turbine business will depend on
the efforts of others; our limited operating history and recent entrance into

evaluate our business and future prospects; the expected benefits of supply and
partnership agreements may not materialize to the extent expected or at all; we
expect to rely increasingly on our proprietary products and systems and on
technology developed by our licensors and partners, and if we or our licensors
or partners become involved in an intellectual property dispute, we may be
forced to spend considerable resources resolving such dispute; a decrease in the
rate of growth of China's industry and economy may lead to a decrease in our
revenues because industrial companies in China are our principal source of
