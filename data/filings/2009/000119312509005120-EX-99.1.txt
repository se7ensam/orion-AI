person of his integrity and professional caliber. At the same time, we are grateful to Jos Streppel for his many years of outstanding service to the company.”  “I am excited and honored by the prospect of joining AEGON as CFO,” said Mr. Nooitgedagt. “These are particularly interesting times to join a global insurance company and I look forward to building on the solid platform
