    “During
the second quarter, we made key strategic steps and forward-looking efforts to
build a foundation for significant future growth,” said Mr. Jinxiang Lu,
A-Power's Chairman and CEO. “We devoted more time to upgrading our DG
engineering service by creating additional value-added customized designs for
biomass-powered micro grid systems, which we believe will be beneficial for
building our track record in the fast-growing biomass power sector. On the new
business front, we successfully signed several large-scale, 30MW-plus DG
contracts that boosted our customer deposits and paved the way for significant
growth in the near future. We entered into an MOU to construct a large offshore
LNG complex and hope to sign definitive documents before the end of this year.
We are also continuing to negotiate with Advance Agro Public Co. of Thailand to
expand the PP9 and PP10 DG projects that we started in July of this year. And
with Shenyang government’s avowed support for our majority-owned DG industry
alliance, Shenyang Power Group, we are well positioned to win high-profile
contracts for DG systems and micro power grids both in China and
overseas.”
     
    Mr. Lu
continued, “As for our wind energy business, we are pleased that we have
finished the assembly of the first two units of the 2.7MW wind turbines, and are
now waiting for government review and approval of the Daxinglong Mountain wind
farm in Liaoning Province, with installation expected to begin by early
September. We have also secured customers for all of our first 30 units of the
2.7MW wind turbines, a substantial portion of which we anticipate will be
shipped by the end of this year. In addition, by August of next year, our JV
with GE Drivetrain is expected to commence trial production, followed by
commercial production to supply to our wind turbine facilities, located just 10
minutes away in the Hunnan New District of Shenyang City, next year. Lastly, we
anticipate our newly acquired proprietary technology for the 1.5MW wind
turbines, and our newly established JVs with Jiangsu Miracle to produce low-cost
wind turbine components such as blades, hubs and nacelle covers, could start
adding to our competitive advantages to become a foreign-partner-supported,
low-cost, vertically integrated 750KW to 2.7MW wind turbine supplier in China’s
hyper-growth wind power market.”
     
    Second
Quarter 2009 Financial Results
    
    For the
three months ended June 30, 2009, A-Power's revenues were $57.5 million,
compared with $65.7 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decline was
primarily because of the delays in some DG projects due to the complexity of
designing customized micro grid electricity generation systems using biomass as
fuel. All revenues in the second quarter of 2009 and 2008 were from the
Company’s DG operations.
     
    Gross
profit was $7.7 million, compared with $8.0 million in the same period of 2008.
Gross margin was 13.4%, a slight increase over 12.1% in the same period of 2008.
Gross margin expanded in 2Q09 mainly because of higher efficiency derived from
cost-saving in labor as the Company undertook larger, 30MW-plus DG
projects.
     
    Selling,
general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $3.0 million, compared
with $2.0 million in the same period of 2008. SG&A as a percentage of
revenue was 5.2%, compared with 3.0% in the same period of 2008. A-Power
incurred higher SG&A expenses mainly through professional consulting,
salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, insurances, office rentals, and
other miscellaneous costs associated with being a public company.
     
    Operating
income was $4.7 million, compared with $6.0 million in the same period of
2008.
    
    Net
income attributable to A-Power shareholders was $6.3 million, compared with $6.2
million in the same period of 2008. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.14,
compared with $0.18 in the same period of 2008.
    
    For the
second quarter of 2009, the weighted average number of shares on a fully diluted
basis was 35.3 million as compared to 33.9 million in the same period of
2008.

2008. Gross margin was 13.1%, compared with 12.0% in the same period of
2008.
    
    SG&A
expenses were $5.6 million, compared with $3.0 million in the same period of

million in the same period of 2008. Diluted EPS was $0.19 in the first half of
2009, compared with $0.34 in the same period of 2008.
    
    For the
first half of 2009, the weighted average number of shares on a fully diluted
basis was 35.0 million as compared to 27.1 million in the same period of
2008.
    
    As of
June 30, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $128.7
million, compared with $60.6 million as of March 31, 2009.
    
    Operating
cash inflow in the first half of 2009 was $45.4 million, compared with $1.2
million in the same period of 2008. Capital expenditures in the first half of
2009 totaled $3.2 million, compared with $17.7 million in the same period of
2008.
    
    Total
shareholders’ equity rose to $168.1 million at June 30, 2009, from $157.5
million at March 31, 2009.

    On July
10, 2009, the Company announced that Shenyang Power Group Co., Ltd. ("Shenyang
Power"), A-Power's majority-owned local DG industry alliance, has signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Macau Natural Gas Co., Ltd. ("MNG") to
construct an offshore liquefied natural gas ("LNG") complex to import, store and
re-gasify LNG and to distribute natural gas to Macau and elsewhere. The project
will be an expansion of MNG's existing natural gas facilities and the total cost
of the project is currently estimated to be $1.5 billion, according to the
MOU.
    
    On June
24, 2009, the Company announced the closing of its offering of $40 million
aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes, plus warrants, to
several institutional investors. Proceeds from the placement will be used
primarily to secure components for A-Power's ramp-up in its wind turbine
assembly business.
     
    Outlook
for the Full Year 2009
     
    A-Power
today reaffirmed its revenue and after-tax net income guidance for 2009 of $320
million and $32 million, respectively. These targets are based on the Company's
current DG contracts, which are subject to change when the Company signs new DG
contracts and/or recognizes revenues from wind turbine sales during 2009.
A-Power expects that it will from time to time provide periodic updates when
additional major DG contracts and wind turbine sales are confirmed.
     
    Mr. Lu
concluded, “Looking forward, we will capitalize on China’s rapid growth of the
clean energy market, spurred by bold, committed government support. On the DG
side, we expect to rapidly deploy various systems domestically and at the same
time work with the Shenyang Power alliance to explore other large-scale projects
overseas. To compete effectively in the wind turbine sector, we will continue to
implement the strategy of partnering with the best technologies in the world and
at the same time pursuing vertical integration to be a low-cost wind turbine
producer in China. We anticipate the various partnerships and acquisitions we
have recently started or completed will gradually integrate into a robust
business in one of the world’s fastest-growing wind power market.”
