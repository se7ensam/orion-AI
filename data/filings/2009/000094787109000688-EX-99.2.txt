2. Reason for the dividend amount
The Company's policy with respect to dividends is that, while aiming to make consistent distributions, because of the fluctuation of the market in which it operates, the Company makes dividend payouts following a target payout ratio of 20% or more.
Due to the unclear outlook of the business environment, we announced interim and year-end dividend forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, as ‘Undecided’ on July 29, 2009. After comprehensive consideration of current conditions, the company has decided interim dividend as above. Our forecast for
the year-end dividend will continue to be ‘Undecided’ because the outlook of business environment remains unclear. It will be announced as soon as it is decided.
