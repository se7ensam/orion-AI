    1. EXERCISE OF
WARRANT.
     
    (a)
Mechanics of
Exercise.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
(including, without limitation, the limitations set forth in Section 1(f)), this
Warrant may be exercised by the Holder on any time or times on or after the
Initial Exercisability Date, in whole or in part, by (i) delivery of a written
notice, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Exercise Notice"), of the
Holder's election to exercise this Warrant and (ii) (A) payment to the Company
of an amount equal to the applicable Exercise Price multiplied by the number of
Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant is being exercised (the "Aggregate Exercise Price") in
cash or by wire transfer of immediately available funds or (B) by notifying the
Company that this Warrant is being exercised pursuant to a Cashless Exercise (as
defined in Section 1(d)).  The Holder shall not be required to deliver
the original Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder unless (A) this
Warrant is being exercised in full to purchase (or acquire by Cashless Exercise)
the total number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant or (B)
the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may
be included in an Exercise Notice) requesting the reissuance of this Warrant
upon physical surrender of this Warrant .  Execution and delivery of
the Exercise Notice with respect to less than all of the Warrant Shares shall
have the same effect as cancellation of the original Warrant and issuance of a
new Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant
Shares.  On or before the first (1st)
Trading Day following the date on which the Company has received each of the
Exercise Notice and the Aggregate Exercise Price (or notice of a Cashless
Exercise) (the "Exercise
Delivery Documents"), the Company shall transmit by facsimile an
acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of the Exercise Delivery Documents to
the Holder and the Company's transfer agent (the "Transfer
Agent").  On or before the third (3rd)
Trading Day following the date on which the Company has received all of the
Exercise Delivery Documents (the "Share Delivery Date"), the
Company shall (X) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated
Securities Transfer Program, and such Common Shares do not require the placement of any
legends restricting transfer of such Common Shares, upon the request of
the Holder, credit such aggregate number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder
is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the Holder's or its designee's balance
account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system, or (Y)
if (I) the Transfer Agent is not
participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program or (II) such Common Shares require the placement of
legends restricting transfer of such Common Shares as required by Section 2(g)
of the Securities Purchase Agreement, issue and dispatch by overnight
courier to the address as specified in the Exercise Notice, a certificate,
registered in the Company's share register in the name of the Holder or its
designee, for the aggregate number of
Common Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise, which certificate shall, in the case of clause (II),
bear a legend in accordance with Section 2(g) of the Securities Purchase
Agreement.  Upon delivery of the Exercise Delivery Documents,
the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder
of record of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been
exercised, irrespective of the date such Warrant Shares are credited to the
Holder's DTC account or the date of delivery of the certificates evidencing such
Warrant Shares, as the case may be.  If this Warrant is submitted in
connection with any exercise pursuant to this Section 1(a) and the number of
Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant submitted for exercise is greater
than the number of Warrant Shares being acquired upon an exercise, then the
Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3)
Trading Days after any exercise and at its own expense, issue a new Warrant (in
accordance with Section 8(d)) representing the right to purchase the number of
Warrant Shares issuable immediately prior to such exercise under this Warrant,
less the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is
exercised.  No fractional Common Shares are to be issued upon the
exercise of this Warrant, but rather the number of Common Shares to be issued
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.  The Company shall
pay any and all transfer, stamp and similar taxes (other than income and similar
taxes) that are required to be paid with respect to the issuance and delivery of
Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.

    (b) Exercise
Price.  For purposes of this Warrant, "Exercise Price"
means  $[   ], subject to adjustment as provided
herein.
    
    (c) Company's Failure to Timely
Deliver Securities.  If the Company shall fail to issue a
certificate to the Holder or to credit the Holder's balance account with DTC, as
applicable, for such number of Common Shares to which the Holder is entitled
upon the Holder's exercise of this Warrant within three (3) Trading Days of
receipt of the Exercise Delivery Documents (an "Exercise Failure"), and if on or after
such Exercise Failure the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or
otherwise) Common Shares to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of
Common Shares issuable upon such exercise that the Holder anticipated receiving
from the Company (a "Buy-In"), then the Company
shall, within three (3) Trading Days after the Holder's request and in the
Holder's discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the
Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other
reasonable out-of-pocket brokerage expenses, if any) for the Common Shares so
purchased (the "Buy-In
Price"), at which point the Company's obligation to issue and deliver
such certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder's balance account with DTC
for such Common Shares shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to
deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Common
Shares or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC and pay cash to the
Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the
product of (A) such number of Common Shares, times (B) the Closing Bid Price on
the date of exercise.
    
    (d) Cashless Exercise.
 Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, if, after the six month anniversary
of the Issuance Date, a Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration
Rights Agreement) covering the resale of the Warrant Shares that are the subject
of the Exercise Notice (the "Unavailable Warrant Shares")
is not available for the resale of such Unavailable Warrant Shares (other than
as a result of the occurrence of an Allowable Grace Period (as defined in the
Registration Rights Agreement) that occurs prior to the four year anniversary of
the date hereof), the Holder may, in its sole discretion, exercise this Warrant
in whole or in part and, in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise
contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise in payment of the
Aggregate Exercise Price, elect instead to receive upon such exercise the "Net
Number" of Common Shares determined according to the following formula (a "Cashless
Exercise"):

    (e) Disputes.  In
the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price or the
arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares, the Company shall promptly issue
to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares that are not disputed and resolve
such dispute in accordance with Section 13.
    
    (f) Limitations on
Exercises.  The Company shall not effect any exercise of this
Warrant, and the Holder shall not have the right to exercise this Warrant, to
the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such Holder (together with
the Holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (the "Maximum Percentage") of the
number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
exercise.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate
number of Common Shares beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates
shall include the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but
shall exclude the number of Common Shares which would be issuable upon (i)
exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially
owned by the Holder and any of its affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of
the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company
beneficially owned by such Person and its affiliates (including, without
limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred stock or warrants)
subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation
contained herein.  Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for
purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "1934
Act").  For purposes of this Warrant, in determining the number
of outstanding Common Shares, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding
Common Shares as reflected in (1) the Company's most recent Form 20-F, Report of
Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K of the Company or other public filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as the case may be, (2)
a more recent public announcement by the Company or (3) any other notice by the
Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of Common Shares
outstanding.  For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral
request of the Holder, the Company shall within two (2) Business Days confirm in
writing to the Holder the number of Common Shares then
outstanding.  In any case, the number of outstanding Common Shares
shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of
securities of the Company, including the SPA Warrants, by the Holder and its
affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding Common Shares
was reported.  By written notice to the Company, the Holder may from
time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage
not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such
increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day
after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to the Holder and not to any other holder of SPA
Warrants.  The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and
implemented in a manner other than in strict conformity with the terms of this
Section 1(f) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be
defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation
herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to
properly give effect to such limitation.

    (g) Insufficient Authorized
Shares.  If at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding
the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved
Common Shares to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon exercise of
this Warrant at least a number of Common Shares equal to 130% (the "Required Reserve Amount") of
the number of Common Shares as shall from time to time be necessary to effect
the exercise of all of this Warrant then outstanding (an "Authorized Share Failure"),
then the Company shall as soon as practicable take all action necessary to
increase the Company's authorized Common Shares to an amount sufficient to allow
the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for this Warrant then
outstanding.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an
Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall either (x) obtain
the vote or written consent of its shareholders for the approval of an increase
in the number of authorized Common Shares and provide each shareholder with an
information statement with respect thereto or (y) hold a meeting of its
shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized Common
Shares.  In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide
each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized
Common Shares and to cause its Board of Directors to recommend to the
shareholders that they approve such proposal.
    
    2. ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE
AND NUMBER OF WARRANT SHARES.  The Exercise Price and the
number of Warrant Shares shall be adjusted from time to time as
follows:
    
    (a) Adjustment upon Issuance of
Common Shares.  If and whenever on or after the Subscription
Date through the second (2nd) year
anniversary of the Issuance Date, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance
with this Section 2 is deemed to have issued or sold, any Common Shares
(including the issuance or sale of Common Shares owned or held by or for the
account of the Company, but excluding Common Shares deemed to have been issued
by the Company in connection with any Excluded Securities (as defined in the SPA
Securities) for a consideration per share (the "New Issuance Price") less than
a price (the "Applicable
Price") equal to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such
issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale (the foregoing a "Dilutive Issuance"), then
immediately after such Dilutive Issuance, the Exercise Price then in effect
shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price.  In the
event of any Dilutive Issuance after the second (2nd) year
anniversary of the Issuance Date, then immediately after such Dilutive Issuance,
the Exercise Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the
product of (A) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such Dilutive
Issuance and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of (I) the
product derived by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to
such Dilutive Issuance and the number of Common Shares Deemed Outstanding
immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance plus (II) the consideration, if any,
received by the Company upon such Dilutive Issuance, by (2) the product derived
by multiplying (I) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such
Dilutive Issuance by (II) the number of Common Shares Deemed Outstanding
immediately after such Dilutive Issuance. Upon each such adjustment of the
Exercise Price hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares shall be adjusted to the
number of Common Shares determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of Warrant Shares acquirable
upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing
the product thereof by the Exercise Price resulting from such
adjustment.  For purposes of determining the adjusted Exercise Price
under this Section 2(a), the following shall be applicable:
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        - 5
- -
        
          
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
     
    (i) Issuance of
Options.  If the Company in any manner grants any Options and
the lowest price per share for which one Common Share is issuable upon the
exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any
Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option is less than
the Applicable Price, then such Common Share shall be deemed to be outstanding
and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or
sale of such Option for such price per share.  For purposes of this
Section 2(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one Common Share is
issuable upon exercise of such Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of such Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option" shall
be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or
receivable by the Company with respect to any one Common Share upon the granting
or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion, exercise
or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such
Option.  No further adjustment of the Exercise Price or number of
Warrant Shares shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Shares or
of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the
actual issuance of such Common Shares upon conversion, exercise or exchange of
such Convertible Securities.
    
    (ii)
Issuance of
Convertible Securities.  If the Company in any manner issues or
sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one
Common Share is issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is
less than the Applicable Price, then such Common Share shall be deemed to be
outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the
issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per
share.  For the purposes of this Section 2(a)(ii), the "lowest price
per share for which one Common Share is issuable upon the conversion, exercise
or exchange thereof" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of
consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one
Common Share upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security.  No
further adjustment of the Exercise Price or number of Warrant Shares shall be
made upon the actual issuance of such Common Shares upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such
Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment
of this Warrant has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this
Section 2(a), no further adjustment of the Exercise Price or number of Warrant
Shares shall be made by reason of such issue or sale.

    (iii)
Change in Option Price
or Rate of Conversion.  If the purchase price provided for in
any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue,
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at
which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Shares increases or decreases at any time, the Exercise
Price and the number of Warrant Shares in effect at the time of such increase or
decrease shall be adjusted to the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant
Shares which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or
Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price,
additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate, as the case
may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold.  For purposes
of this Section 2(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
that was outstanding as of the date of issuance of this Warrant are increased or
decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then
such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Shares deemed issuable upon
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as
of the date of such increase or decrease.  No adjustment pursuant to
this Section 2(a) shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase
of the Exercise Price then in effect or a decrease in the number of Warrant
Shares.
    
    (iv)
Calculation of
Consideration Received.  In case any Option is issued in
connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together
comprising one integrated transaction, (x) the Options will be deemed to have
been issued for a value determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing
Model (the "Option
Value") and (y) the other securities issued or sold in such integrated
transaction shall be deemed to have been issued for the difference of (I) the
aggregate consideration received by the Company, less (II) the Option
Value.  If any Common Shares, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration
received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company
therefor.  If any Common Shares, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such
consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value of
such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in
which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the
Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of receipt.  If any
Common Shares, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the
non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the
surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the
fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving
entity as is attributable to such Common Shares, Options or Convertible
Securities, as the case may be.  The fair value of any consideration
other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the
Required Holders.  If such parties are unable to reach agreement
within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the
"Valuation Event"), the
fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days
after the tenth (10th) day
following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly
selected by the Company and the Required Holders.  The determination
of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest
error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the
Company.

    (v) Record
Date.  If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common
Shares for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other
distribution payable in Common Shares, Options or in Convertible Securities or
(B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares, Options or Convertible
Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or
sale of the Common Shares deemed to have been issued or sold upon the
declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the
date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may
be.
    
    (b) Voluntary Adjustment By
Company.  The Company may at any time during the term of this
Warrant reduce the then current Exercise Price to any amount and for any period
of time deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors of the
Company.
    
    (c) Adjustment upon Subdivision
or Combination of Common Shares.  If the Company at any time on
or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Common
Shares into a greater number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately
prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number of
Warrant Shares will be proportionately increased.  If the Company at
any time on or after the Subscription Date  combines (by combination,
reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Common
Shares into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately
prior to such combination will be proportionately increased and the number of
Warrant Shares will be proportionately decreased.  Any adjustment
under this Section 2(c) shall become effective at the close of business on the
date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

    (d) Other
Events.  If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the
provisions of this Section 2 but not expressly provided for by such provisions
(including, without limitation, the granting of share appreciation rights,
phantom share rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's
Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Exercise Price and
the number of Warrant Shares so as to protect the rights of the Holder; provided
that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 2(d) will increase the Exercise
Price or decrease the number of Warrant Shares as otherwise determined pursuant
to this Section 2.
    
    (e) De Minimis
Adjustments.  No adjustment in the Exercise Price or number of
issuable Warrant Shares shall be required unless such Exercise Price adjustment
would require an increase or decrease of at least $0.05 in such price; provided, however, that any
adjustment which by reason of this Section 2(e) is not required to be made shall
be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustments under
this Section 2.  All calculations under this Section 2 shall be made
by the Company in good faith and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the
nearest one hundredth of a share, as applicable.  No adjustment need
be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Company's Common
Shares.
    
    3. RIGHTS UPON DISTRIBUTION OF
ASSETS.  If the Company shall declare or make any dividend or
other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) (other than
Pill Rights) to holders of Common Shares, by way of return of capital or
otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or
other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off,
reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other
similar transaction other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in
Common Shares for which an adjustment is made pursuant to Section 2(c)) (a
"Distribution"), at any
time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case:
    
    (a) any
Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the
record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to
receive the Distribution shall be reduced, effective as of the close of business
on such record date, to a price determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by
a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the Closing Bid Price of the
Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding such record date minus
the value of the Distribution (as determined in good faith by the Company's
Board of Directors) applicable to one share of Common Shares, and (ii) the
denominator shall be the Closing Bid Price of the Common Shares on the Trading
Day immediately preceding such record date; and
    
    (b) the
number of Warrant Shares shall be increased to a number of shares equal to the
number of Common Shares obtainable immediately prior to the close of business on
the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled
to receive the Distribution multiplied by the reciprocal of the fraction set
forth in the immediately preceding paragraph (a); provided that in the event
that the Distribution is of Common Shares (or common shares or common stock)
("Other Common Shares")
of a company whose common shares are traded on a national securities exchange or
a national automated quotation system, then the Holder may elect to receive a
warrant to purchase Other Common Shares in lieu of an increase in the number of
Warrant Shares, the terms of which shall be identical to those of this Warrant,
except that such warrant shall be exercisable into the number of shares of Other
Common Shares that would have been payable to the Holder pursuant to the
Distribution had the Holder exercised this Warrant immediately prior to such
record date and with an aggregate exercise price equal to the product of the
amount by which the exercise price of this Warrant was decreased with respect to
the Distribution pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding paragraph
(a) and the number of Warrant Shares calculated in accordance with the first
part of this paragraph (b).  The Holder shall notify the Company
within two (2) Business Days of its receipt of notice of the record date for
such Distribution as to its election under this Section 3(b) and, in the absence
of any such notice from the Holder, Holder shall be deemed to have elected to
accept an increase in the number of Warrant Shares.

    4. PURCHASE RIGHTS; FUNDAMENTAL
TRANSACTIONS.
    
    (a) Purchase
Rights.  In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 2
above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options,
Convertible Securities or rights to purchase shares, warrants, securities or
other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Shares
(other than Pill Rights) (the "Purchase Rights"), then the
Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase
Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if
the Holder had held the number of Common Shares acquirable upon complete
exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of
this Warrant) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the
grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken,
the date as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined
for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.
    
    (b) Fundamental
Transactions.  The Company shall not enter into or be party to
a Fundamental Transaction unless (i)  the Successor Entity, if a
Person other than the Company (with the Company being deemed to automatically so
assume), assumes in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this
Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of
this Section (4)(b) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and approved by the Required
Holders prior to such Fundamental Transaction (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), including agreements to deliver to each holder of the
SPA Warrants in exchange for its Warrant a security of the Successor Entity
evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to
the SPA Warrants, including, without limitation, an adjusted exercise price
equal to the value for the Common Shares reflected by the terms of such
Fundamental Transaction, and exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of
capital stock equivalent to the Common Shares acquirable and receivable upon
exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of
this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and satisfactory to the
Required Holders and (ii) the Successor Entity (or its Parent Entity if such
assumption is effected by the Parent Entity) is a publicly traded corporation
whose common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on an Eligible
Market.  Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the
Successor Entity, if a Person other than the Company (with the Company being
deemed to automatically so succeed), shall succeed to, and be substituted for
(so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions
of this Warrant referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to the Successor
Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume
all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant with the same effect as
if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein.  Upon
consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity, if a Person
other than the Company (with the Company being deemed to automatically so be
required), shall deliver to the Holder confirmation that there shall be issued
upon exercise of this Warrant at any time after the consummation of the
Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the Common Shares (or other securities,
cash, assets or other property) issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant prior
to such Fundamental Transaction such shares of the publicly traded common stock
or common shares (or its equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its
Parent Entity) which the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the
happening of such Fundamental Transaction had this Warrant been converted
immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, as adjusted in accordance
with the provisions of this Warrant.  In addition to and not in
substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any
Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of Common Shares are entitled
to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common
Shares (a "Corporate
Event"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the
Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon an exercise of this
Warrant at any time after the consummation of the Corporate Event but prior to
the Expiration Date, in lieu of Common Shares (or other securities, cash, assets
or other property) purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant prior to such
Corporate Event, such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other
property whatsoever (including warrants or other purchase or subscription
rights) which the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening
of such Corporate Event had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to
such Corporate Event.  Provision made pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Required Holders.  The provisions of this Section shall apply
similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and Corporate
Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the exercise of
this Warrant.

    (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, at the
request of the Holder delivered before the ninetieth (90th) day
after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, the Company (or the
Successor Entity) shall purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying to the
Holder, within five (5) Business Days after such request (or, if later, on the
effective date of the Fundamental Transaction), cash in an amount equal to the
Black Scholes Value of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the
date of such Fundamental Transaction.
    
    5. PARTICIPATION.  The
Holder, as the holder of this Warrant, shall be entitled to receive any Pill
Rights (or, at the option of the Holder, to the extent such Pill Rights become
exercisable or have been exercised into equity interests of the Company or any
other distribution is made of equity interests of the Company to holders of such
Pill Rights, such equity interests of the Company) made to the holders of Common
Shares concurrently with any issuance of Common Shares upon exercise of this
Warrant to the same extent as if the Holder had exercised this Warrant into such
Common Shares (without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or
elsewhere) and had held such Common Shares on the record date for such dividend
or distribution of Pill Rights.
    
    6. NONCIRCUMVENTION.  The
Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of
its Memorandum and Articles of Association or through any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, and
will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Warrant and
take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the
Holder.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
(i) shall not increase the par value of any Common Shares receivable upon the
exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, (ii) shall
take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the
Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Common Shares
upon the exercise of this Warrant, and (iii) shall, so long as any of the SPA
Warrants are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep
available out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares, solely for the
purpose of effecting the exercise of the SPA Warrants, 130% of the number of
Common Shares as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the exercise of
the SPA Warrants then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on
exercise).  For the avoidance of doubt, solicitation by the Company in
accordance with the requirements of the SPA Warrants and the Securities Purchase
Agreement of the consents of the Required Holders to any amendment, modification
or waiver of any provision of the SPA Warrants shall not be or be deemed an
avoidance of performance of the terms of this Warrant.

    7. WARRANT HOLDER NOT DEEMED A
SHAREHOLDER.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
the Holder, solely in such Person's capacity as a holder of this Warrant, shall
not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of share
capital of the Company for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this
Warrant be construed to confer upon the Holder, solely in such Person's capacity
as the Holder of this Warrant, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company
or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether
any reorganization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation,
merger, conveyance or otherwise), receive notice of meetings, receive dividends
or subscription rights, or otherwise, prior to the issuance to the Holder of the
Warrant Shares which such Person is then entitled to receive upon the due
exercise of this Warrant.  In addition, nothing contained in this
Warrant shall be construed as imposing any liabilities on the Holder to purchase
any securities (upon exercise of this Warrant or otherwise) or as a shareholder
of the Company, whether such liabilities are asserted by the Company or by
creditors of the Company.  Notwithstanding this Section 7, to the
extent not available through the EDGAR filing system of the SEC, the Company
shall provide the Holder with copies of the same notices and other information
given to the shareholders of the Company generally, contemporaneously with the
giving thereof to the shareholders.
    
    8. REISSUANCE OF
WARRANTS.
    
    (a) Transfer of
Warrant.  If this Warrant is to be transferred, the Holder
shall surrender this Warrant to the Company, whereupon the Company will
forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Warrant (in
accordance with Section 8(d)), registered as the Holder may request,
representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares being
transferred by the Holder and, if less than the total number of Warrant Shares
then underlying this Warrant is being transferred, a new Warrant (in accordance
with Section 8(d)) to the Holder representing the right to purchase the number
of Warrant Shares not being transferred.
    
    (b) Lost, Stolen or Mutilated
Warrant.  Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any
indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary form and,
in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the
Company shall execute and deliver to the Holder a new Warrant (in accordance
with Section 8(d)) representing the right to purchase the Warrant Shares then
underlying this Warrant.

    (c) Exchangeable for Multiple
Warrants.  This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender
hereof by the Holder at the principal office of the Company, for a new Warrant
or Warrants (in accordance with Section 8(d)) representing in the aggregate the
right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant, and
each such new Warrant will represent the right to purchase such portion of such
Warrant Shares as is designated by the Holder at the time of such surrender;
provided, however, that no Warrants for fractional Common Shares shall be
given.
    
    (d) Issuance of New
Warrants.  Whenever the Company is required to issue a new
Warrant pursuant to the terms of this Warrant, such new Warrant (i) shall be of
like tenor with this Warrant, (ii) shall represent, as indicated on the face of
such new Warrant, the right to purchase the Warrant Shares then underlying this
Warrant (or in the case of a new Warrant being issued pursuant to Section 8(a)
or Section 8(c), the Warrant Shares designated by the Holder which, when added
to the number of Common Shares underlying the other new Warrants issued in
connection with such issuance, does not exceed the number of Warrant Shares then
underlying this Warrant), (iii) shall have an issuance date, as indicated on the
face of such new Warrant which is the same as the Issuance Date, and (iv) shall
have the same rights and conditions as this Warrant.
    
    9. NOTICES.  Whenever
notice is required to be given under this Warrant, unless otherwise provided
herein, such notice shall be given in accordance with Section 9(f) of the
Securities  Purchase Agreement.  The Company shall provide
the Holder with prompt written notice of all actions taken pursuant to this
Warrant, including in reasonable detail a description of such action and the
reason therefor.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company will give written notice to the Holder (i) immediately upon any
adjustment of the Exercise Price, setting forth in reasonable detail, and
certifying, the calculation of such adjustment and (ii) at least fifteen (15)
days or such shorter period as may be permitted by the Principal Market for the
public announcement of any such record date prior to the date on which the
Company closes its books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or
distribution upon the Common Shares, (B) with respect to any grants, issuances
or sales of any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock,
warrants, securities or other property to holders of Common Shares or (C) for
determining rights to vote with respect to any Fundamental Transaction,
dissolution or liquidation, provided in each case that such information shall be
made known to the public prior to or in conjunction with such notice being
provided to the Holder.
    
    10. AMENDMENT AND
WAIVER.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of
this Warrant may be amended and the Company may take any action herein
prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it,
only if the Company has obtained the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called
for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the Required
Holders; provided that no such action may increase the exercise price of any SPA
Warrant or decrease the number of shares or class of stock obtainable upon
exercise of any SPA Warrant without the written consent of the
Holder.  No such amendment shall be effective to the extent that it
applies to less than all of the holders of the SPA Warrants then
outstanding.

    11. GOVERNING
LAW.  This Warrant shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accor­dance with, and all questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and performance of this Warrant shall be governed by,
the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdictions other than the State of New York.
    
    12. CONSTRUCTION;
HEADINGS.  This Warrant shall be deemed to be jointly drafted
by the Company and all the Buyers and shall not be construed against any person
as the drafter hereof.  The headings of this Warrant are for
convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the
interpretation of, this Warrant.
    
    13. DISPUTE
RESOLUTION.  In the case of a dispute as to the determination
of the Exercise Price or the arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares, the
Company shall submit the disputed determinations or arithmetic calculations via
facsimile within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Exercise Notice
giving rise to such dispute, as the case may be, to the Holder.  If
the Holder and the Company are unable to agree upon such determination or
calculation of the Exercise Price or the Warrant Shares within three (3)
Business Days of such disputed determination or arithmetic calculation being
submitted to the Holder, then the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days
submit via facsimile (a) the disputed determination of the Exercise Price to an
independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Company and approved by
the Holder, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, or (b) the disputed
arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares to the Company's independent,
outside accountant.  The Company shall cause at its expense the
investment bank or the accountant, as the case may be, to perform the
determinations or calculations and notify the Company and the Holder of the
results no later than ten Business Days from the time it receives the disputed
determinations or calculations.  Such investment bank's or
accountant's determination or calculation, as the case may be, shall be binding
upon all parties absent demonstrable error.
    
    14. REMEDIES, OTHER OBLIGATIONS,
BREACHES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  The remedies provided in this
Warrant shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available
under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents, at law or in equity
(including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and
nothing herein shall limit the right of the Holder to pursue damages for any
failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Warrant.  The
Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause
irreparable harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach
may be inadequate.  The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of
any such breach or threatened breach, the holder of this Warrant shall be
entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction
restraining any breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and
without any bond or other security being required.
    
    15. TRANSFER. This
Warrant may be offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned without the
consent of the Company, except as may otherwise be required by Section 2(f) of
the Securities Purchase Agreement.

    16. SEVERABILITY. If any
provision of this Warrant is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to be
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision
that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed
amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable,
and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining provisions of this Warrant so long as this Warrant as
so modified continues to express, without material change, the original
intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited
nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not
substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of
the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be
conferred upon the parties.  The parties will endeavor in good faith
negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s)
with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to
that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s).
    
    17. TAXES.
    
    (a) Any
and all payments by the Company hereunder, including any amounts received on a
exercise or redemption of the Warrant and any amounts on account of interest or
deemed interest, shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, imposed under any law,
rule, code or regulation of the People's Republic of China, the British Virgin
Islands or any other non-U.S. governmental authority, including, without
limitation, any federal, state, local, provincial or other similar non-U.S.
governmental authority (collectively referred to as "International
Taxes").  If the Company shall be required to deduct any
International Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the
Holder, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount by which the sum
payable would otherwise have to be increased (the "tax make-whole amount") to
ensure that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to the tax make-whole amount) the Holder would receive an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)
the Company shall make such deductions and (iii) the Company shall pay the full
amount withheld or deducted to the applicable governmental authority within the
time required.
    
    (b) In
addition, the Company agrees to pay to the relevant governmental authority in
accordance with applicable law any present or future stamp or documentary taxes
or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from
any payment made hereunder or in connection with the execution, delivery,
registration or performance of, or otherwise with respect to, this Warrant
("Other
Taxes").  The Company shall deliver to the Holder official
receipts, if any, in respect of any International Taxes and Other Taxes payable
hereunder promptly after payment of such International Taxes, Other Taxes or
other evidence of payment reasonably acceptable to the Holder.
    
    (c) The
obligations of the Company under this Section 17(b) shall survive the
termination of this Warrant and the payment of the Warrant and all other amounts
payable hereunder.
