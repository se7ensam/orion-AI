      HÜNENBERG, Switzerland – February 11,
2009 – Alcon, Inc. (NYSE:ACL) reported global sales of $1,497.5 million
for the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 1.9 percent compared to the
fourth quarter of 2007, or 7.1 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations. Acquisition revenue contributed growth of 0.7 percent, resulting
in an organic growth rate of 6.4 percent. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of
2008 increased 12.5 percent to $423.6 million, or $1.41 per share on a diluted
basis, compared to $376.5 million, or $1.25 per share on a diluted basis for the
fourth quarter of 2007.
      
      For the
full year 2008, Alcon, Inc. reported global sales of $6,293.7 million, an
increase of 12.4 percent over 2007 global sales of $5,599.6 million, or 9.5
percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Acquisition
revenue contributed growth of 1.2 percent, resulting in an organic growth rate
of 8.3 percent. Net earnings for 2008 rose 29.0 percent to $2,046.5 million, or
$6.79 per share on a diluted basis compared to $1,586.4 million or $5.25 per
share on a diluted basis for the full year 2007. Results for 2008 included a
$235.7 million reduction in taxes related to an agreement with the Internal
Revenue Service regarding the company’s investment in and advances to the former
Summit Autonomous, Inc. Excluding this tax benefit, net earnings for the full
year 2008 would have been $1,810.8 million or $6.00 per diluted share. Results
for 2007 included an after tax charge of $20.8 million related to the impairment
of Alcon’s refractive assets.
      
      Reconciliations
of reported and adjusted results for the full year are included in the financial
tables below.

      “I am
pleased to report that Alcon again delivered solid financial results for the
fourth quarter and full year of 2008, and did so in a challenging business
environment, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. The long term strategic
drivers of our business remain in place, supported by the favorable demographics
of the eye care industry and our demonstrated ability to gain market share,”
said Cary Rayment, Alcon’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “In
response to the environment we expect to face in 2009, we will prioritize
spending on research and development and market development activities that
drive future growth, while implementing actions to reduce our overall cost
structure.”
      
      “Furthermore,
our solid performance in 2008 demonstrated that Alcon continues to make progress
against its strategic imperatives even in the current challenging business
environment,” said Rayment. “More importantly, I believe that as the economy
recovers and currency rates stabilize, Alcon should strengthen sales growth and
continue to deliver profitability well above the industry average.”
      
      
      Fourth
Quarter Sales Review
      Highlights
of sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 are provided
below. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are versus the
fourth quarter of 2007.

                International
      sales rose 1.2 percent to $832.3 million, or 10.4 percent excluding
      foreign exchange, with sales in emerging markets increasing 3.0 percent,
      or 16.4 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Sales in the
      United States increased 2.8 percent to $665.2
  million.

                Pharmaceutical
      sales of $578.1 million were flat in the quarter, but grew 4.8
      percent on a constant currency basis. Outside the U.S., Alcon
      reported solid growth with pharmaceutical sales rising 10.9 percent in
      constant currency. U.S. pharmaceutical sales were negatively affected
      by a decline in prescription volumes for the U.S. ophthalmic
      market. Despite the slowdown in the U.S. market, the company saw its
      pharmaceutical market shares rise on a global basis, led by the TRAVATAN®
      family of products (including TRAVATAN®, TRAVATAN Z®
      and DuoTravTM
      ophthalmic solutions). Total TRAVATAN®
      family sales rose 11.3 percent in the quarter, while combined sales of
      TRAVATAN Z® and DuoTravTM
      ophthalmic solutions increased 57.7 percent. Economic and seasonal factors
      had a negative impact on global sales of allergy products, which fell 12.7
      percent. Alcon’s flagship allergy products, Patanol®
      and Pataday™ ophthalmic solutions,
      increased their combined U.S. market share from 73.5 to 77.8 percent
      during the quarter.

                Surgical
      sales of $723.2 million rose 3.2 percent, or 8.5 percent on a constant
      currency basis. Unit growth of 6.5 percent for AcrySof® intraocular lenses
      continued to exceed the estimated global growth rate of cataract
      procedures. Increased market penetration of the company’s advanced
      technology monofocal and multifocal IOLs continued to contribute to growth
      in IOL sales. Combined sales of AcrySof® IQ and AcrySof® Natural lenses
      rose 12.2 percent in the quarter, while combined sales of the AcrySof® Toric and AcrySof® ReSTOR® Aspheric
      lenses increased 27.8 percent. Unit sales of cataract
      systems increased 4.1 percent in the quarter, which reflects the continued
      success of the Infiniti® vision system with
      the OZil® torsional hand
      piece and the launch of the Laureate®
      phacoemulsification system in multiple markets outside

WaveLight AG, but combined WaveLight®
and LADARVision® U.S. procedures
declined 15.2 percent for the quarter. The U.S. procedure decline compares
favorably to an estimated 38 percent decline in overall U.S. market
procedures in the fourth quarter of 2008.

      disinfectants grew 7.6 percent, as OPTI-FREE® RepleniSH® multipurpose
      disinfecting solution experienced strong sales growth in the United States
      and maintained its leading share position. Sales of artificial
      tears increased 2.3 percent despite the negative effects of
      currency fluctuations. Global sales of Systane®
      lubricant eye drops continue to do well, bolstered by the
      U.S. launch of Systane® ULTRA in
      July 2008.
              
            
        
      
       
      Fourth Quarter Earnings Review
      Highlights
of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 are provided

quarter of 2007.

                Gross
      profit margin of 79.2 percent reflected an increase of
      4.5 percentage points, much of which was due to a temporary impact on
      cost of goods sold of the sharp devaluation of most foreign currencies
      against the U.S. dollar.

                Selling,
      general and administrative expenses increased 1.7 percent, which reflected
      cost control actions taken by management to reduce and prioritize spending
      in the face of the challenging economic environment. Alcon’s captive
      insurance company settled claims against the third parties for damages
      incurred prior to 2006 at one of Alcon’s sales and distribution
      facilities.

      and development expenses (excluding in-process R&D in 2007) decreased
      1.6 percent to $157.4 million, or 10.5 percent of sales. The decline
      in R&D expenses was primarily due to several milestone payments made
      in 2007 and differences in timing of costs associated with regulatory
      filings and clinical studies between the two periods. The company
      also incurred $9.3 million of in-process R&D costs in the fourth
      quarter of 2007 associated with the WaveLight
  acquisition.

                Operating
      income increased 20.0 percent to $573.1 million, as a
      result of the higher gross profit margin, slower growth in SG&A
      and the 2007 in-process R&D
charge.

      non-operating income/expense was a loss of $92.9 million, which included
      $83.3 million of losses on the company’s investment portfolio. Total
      investment losses include $32.1 million of impairment charges on
      investments classified as available for
sale.

                The
      company’s effective tax rate declined to 11.8 percent from 21.5 percent
      primarily due to the impact of the tax benefit related to the
      establishment of a Swiss Shared Service Center and the
      retroactive passage of the U.S. R&D tax
  credit.

                Net
      earnings increased 12.5 percent to $423.6 million as a result
      of foreign exchange driven gross profit margin improvements, diligent
      management of SG&A costs, timing of R&D expenses and a lower
      effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by the
      negative impact of foreign exchange on sales and losses on the company’s
      investment portfolio.

Guidance
      In light
of the current dynamics in the marketplace, the company expects 2009 organic
sales growth (excluding currency and acquisitions) to be in the mid-single
digits. The company also expects that organic sales growth in the first half of
the year is likely to be at the low end of this range due to the current
challenging economic and market environment. The company also projects diluted
earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to be between $6.00 and $6.20 and on an
adjusted basis (excluding restructuring charges) to be between $6.05 and
$6.25.

                In
      its ongoing quest to maintain a world class organization, the company has
      initiated programs to align its operations with the evolving economic and
      market environment. These programs include a staffing reduction that will
      result in a pre-tax charge of approximately $21 million, the majority of
      which will be incurred in the first quarter of 2009. The staffing
      reduction is expected to deliver ongoing annualized savings of
      approximately $40 million beginning in the second quarter, with the full
      effect realized in the second half of
2009.

      Note: Percent Change in Constant
Currency calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations. Management believes constant currency sales growth is an important
measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with a clearer
picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit volumes and
local currency prices.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Certain reclassifications have been made to
prior year amounts to conform with current year presentation.

      Note: Percent Change in Constant
Currency calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations. Management believes constant currency sales growth is an important
measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with a clearer
picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit volumes and
local currency prices.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Certain reclassifications have been made to
prior year amounts to conform with current year presentation.

Adjusted net earnings and diluted EPS measure the results of the company's
operations without certain items that pertained only to the period presented.
Management believes these measures are an important measure of the company’s
operations because it provides investors with a clearer picture of the core
operations of the company.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.

      Note:
Constant currency sales growth rates calculate sales growth without the impact
of foreign exchange fluctuations. Organic sales growth rates calculate sales
growth without the impact of foreign exchange and acquisition fluctuations.
Management believes constant currency sales growth and organic sales growth are
important measures of the company’s operations because they provide investors
with a clearer picture of the core rates of sales growth attributable to changes
in unit volumes and local currency prices and, with respect to organic sales
growth, excluding the effect of acquisitions.  These measures are
considered non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G promulgated by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
