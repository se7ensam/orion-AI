Second Quarter 2009 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009 were RMB193.3 million (US$28.3 million),
a decrease of 11.6% from RMB218.7 million for the same quarter in 2008.


Print advertising revenues for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 28.5% to RMB67.2 million
(US$9.8 million) compared with RMB93.9 million for the same quarter in 2008. The decrease was
primarily due to a lower volume of print advertising pages in 51job Weekly, which was affected by a
decline in market demand resulting from the continued impact of the global economic downturn and
the slower economic growth environment in China. The estimated number of print advertising pages
generated in the second quarter of 2009 decreased 32.9% to 2,860 compared with 4,263 pages in the
same quarter in 2008. Although print advertising prices charged in each city remained relatively
stable as compared to the second quarter of 2008, overall average revenue per page increased 6.6%
due to an increase in page volume contribution from cities where print advertising prices are
generally higher as compared to the same quarter of the prior year.


Online recruitment services revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were RMB77.4 million (US$11.3
million), representing a 7.1% decrease from RMB83.3 million for the same quarter of the prior year.
The decrease primarily resulted from lower average revenue per unique employer, which was
partially offset by an increase in the number of unique employers using the Company’s online
recruitment services. Average revenue per unique employer decreased 23.9% in the second quarter of
2009 as compared to the same quarter in 2008 due to employers purchasing lower priced products
and/or reducing their overall spending on online recruitment services. Unique employers using the
Company’s online recruitment services increased 22.1% to 79,151 in the second quarter of 2009
compared with 64,813 in the same quarter of the prior year driven by an acceleration in customer
adoption of online recruitment services.


Other human resource related revenues for the second quarter of 2009 increased 17.4% to RMB48.7
million (US$7.1 million) from RMB41.5 million in the same quarter of 2008 principally due to
greater customer demand for human resource outsourcing services, which was partially offset by
lower revenues from executive search and training services.


Gross profit for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 4.2% to RMB109.6 million (US$16.0 million)
from RMB114.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is equal to
gross profit divided by net revenues, improved to 59.8% in the second quarter of 2009 compared with
54.9% in the same quarter in 2008 primarily due to lower printing related and other direct expenses
resulting from the implementation of cost control and efficiency measures.


Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2009 were RMB82.8 million (US$12.1 million) compared
with RMB84.1 million for the same quarter of 2008. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues was 45.2% for the second quarter of 2009 compared with 40.4% for the second quarter of
2008. Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues was 42.1% in the second quarter of 2009 compared with 37.5% in the second quarter of 2008.


Sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 7.1% to RMB48.5 million
(US$7.1 million) from RMB52.2 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to a
decrease in advertising and promotion expenses and travel and entertainment expenses, which were
partially offset by higher salary and benefits expenses compared to the same quarter in 2008.


General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2009 increased 7.4% to RMB34.3
million (US$5.0 million) from RMB31.9 million in the second quarter of 2008, which was mainly
attributable to higher rental, depreciation and employee related expenses incurred in the second
quarter of 2009.


Income from operations for the second quarter of 2009 was RMB26.8 million (US$3.9 million) compared
with RMB30.3 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The Company’s effective tax rate was
32.7% in the second quarter of 2009 compared with 36.3% in the second quarter of the prior year.


Net income for the second quarter of 2009 was RMB20.8 million (US$3.0 million) compared with
RMB19.3 million for the same quarter in 2008. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the
second quarter of 2009 were RMB0.37 (US$0.05) compared with RMB0.34 for the same quarter in 2008.
Fully diluted earnings per ADS for the second quarter of 2009 were RMB0.74 (US$0.11) compared with
RMB0.68 in the second quarter of 2008.


In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB6.8 million (US$1.0 million) compared with RMB7.2 million in the second quarter of 2008. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation loss of RMB142,000 (US$21,000) in the second
quarter of 2009 compared with a translation loss of RMB6.6 million in the second quarter of 2008.


Excluding share-based compensation expense and the impact of foreign currency translation loss,
non-GAAP adjusted income for the second quarter of 2009 was RMB27.7 million (US$4.1 million)
compared with RMB33.1 million for the second quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted
earnings per common share were RMB0.50 (US$0.07) in the second quarter of 2009 compared with
RMB0.58 in the second quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per ADS in the
second quarter of 2009 were RMB0.99 (US$0.14) compared with RMB1.17 in the second quarter of 2008.

ADSs, representing 1,042,084 common shares, for an aggregate consideration of US$3.8 million.

Business Outlook


For the third quarter of 2009, based on current market and operating conditions, the Company’s
revenue target is in the estimated range of RMB198 million to RMB208 million (US$29.0 million to
US$30.5 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense and any foreign currency translation
loss or gain, the Company’s non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the third quarter of 2009 is
in the estimated range of RMB0.48 to RMB0.58 per common share (US$0.14 to US$0.17 per ADS). The
Company expects aggregate share-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2009 to be in
the estimated range of RMB6 million to RMB7 million (US$0.9 million to US$1.0 million).


Other Company News


In June 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase office space in Wuhan Optical
Valley Software Park in the city of Wuhan, China. These premises are intended to house the
Company’s new call center which will provide nationwide sales support and customer service. The
aggregate purchase price of the premises is approximately RMB22.6 million (US$3.3 million), of
which RMB13.5 million (US$2.0 million) was paid in the second quarter of 2009. The Company expects
to incur additional expenses associated with taxes, renovations, moving and other related
activities. The Company expects to begin occupying the new premises in early 2010.


Currency Convenience Translation


For the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars at
the rate of RMB6.8302 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi
per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board,
as of June 30, 2009.


Conference Call Information


Management of 51job will host a conference call at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 6, 2009 (9:00

call will be available live and on replay through 51job’s investor relations website, ir.51job.com.
Please go to the website at least fifteen minutes early to register or install any necessary audio
software. Participants may also dial into the teleconference at +1-800-238-9007 (+1-719-457-2600
for international callers) and provide the passcode 2196445. An audio replay of the conference

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of adjusted net
income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from
results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and foreign
currency translation gain or loss. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company’s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company’s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss from its non-GAAP
financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation gain or loss is
unrelated to the Company’s core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor
impact the Company’s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP measures excluding
share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss are important in
helping investors to understand the Company’s current financial performance and future prospects
and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The
presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to
GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The
non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.
