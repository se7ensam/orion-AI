FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
This document contains
forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management and
reflect our current expectations as contemplated under the safe harbor
provisions of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Such statements include, but are not limited to,
statements with respect to our objectives, goals and outlook including our
estimated product shipments, revenue and operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures), as well as statements with respect to our beliefs, plans,
objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions. Words such as
"estimate", "project", "believe", "anticipate", "intend", "expect", "plan",
"predict", "may", "should", "will", the negatives of these words or other
variations thereof and comparable terminology are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are difficult
to predict.
In particular, these
forward-looking statements are based on certain specific assumptions relating to
our expectations with respect to the generation of new sales, producing,
delivering and selling the expected product volumes at the expected prices, and
controlling our costs. They are also based on a variety of general factors and
assumptions including, but not limited to, our expectations regarding product
development efforts, manufacturing capacity, product pricing, market demand, and
the availability and prices of raw materials, labour and supplies. These
assumptions have been derived from information available to the Company
including information obtained by the Company from third parties. These
assumptions may prove to be incorrect in whole or in part. In addition, actual
results may differ materially from those expressed, implied, or forecasted in
such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from the results expressed, implied or forecasted
in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the
condition of the global economy; the rate of mass adoption of our products;
changes in product pricing; changes in our customers' requirements, the
competitive environment and related market conditions; product development
delays; changes in the availability or price of raw materials, labour and
supplies; our ability to attract and retain business partners, suppliers,
employees and customers; changing environmental regulations; our access to
funding and our ability to provide the capital required for product development,
operations and marketing efforts; our ability to protect our intellectual
property; the magnitude of the rate of change of the Canadian dollar versus the
U.S. dollar; and the general assumption that none of the risks identified in the
Risks and Uncertainties section of this report or in our most recent Annual
Information Form will materialize. Readers should not place undue reliance on
Ballard's forward-looking statements.


The forward-looking statements
contained in this document speak only as of the date of this Management
Discussion and Analysis. Except as required by applicable legislation, Ballard
does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this Management Discussion and Analysis, including the occurrence of
unanticipated events.
SEGMENT
DISCLOSURES
Over the past three years, we have
refined the Company’s business strategy to establish a sharp focus on what we
believe to be key growth opportunities with near-term commercial prospects in
our core fuel cell markets. For 2009, we are reporting our results in the
following market segments:
1. Fuel Cell Products (core segment): fuel cell products and services for motive power
(material handling and bus markets) and stationary power (back-up power and
residential cogeneration markets);
2. Contract Automotive (supporting segment): contract technical and manufacturing services primarily for AFCC,
Daimler and Ford.
3. Material Products (supporting segment): carbon
friction material products primarily for automotive applications and gas
diffusion layer (“GDL”) material for fuel cell products.
Comparative figures are presented
in conformance with our new operating segments. Historic comparative quarterly
revenue results (unaudited) for 2008 are as follows:

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW – Quarter
ended March 31, 2009
Revenue
Our revenues for the three months
ended March 31, 2009 decreased to $8.1 million, or 50%, compared to $16.0
million for the first quarter of 2008 due primarily to the continuing slowdown
in the automotive sector negatively impacting our supporting business segments.
Contract Automotive and Material Products revenues are down $5.6 million due to
lower shipments of light-duty automotive modules and carbon friction material
products combined with the elimination of light-duty automotive fuel cell
program work subsequent to the closing of the AFCC transaction on January 31,
2008 (the “AFCC Transaction”). In addition, Fuel Cell Products engineering
development revenues are down $2.3 million due primarily to the completion of
the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell development program in the third
quarter of 2008. In our core Fuel Cell Products segment, product and service
revenues of $3.9 million is essentially flat versus the prior year quarter of
$4.0 million.


Net income
(loss)
Our net loss for the three months
ended March 31, 2009 increased to $18.6 million, or ($0.22) per share, compared
with net income of $81.0 million, or $0.87 per share, in the first quarter of
2008. The first quarter net income in 2008 includes a gain on sale of assets of
$96.9 million related to the AFCC Transaction. The first quarter net loss in
2009 includes severance and related costs of $1.1 million relating to a 7%
workforce reduction initiated in March 2009.
Normalized net
loss
Our normalized net loss (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for the first quarter of 2009 increased $1.6 million to $17.5
million, or ($0.21) per share, compared with a normalized net loss of $15.9
million, or ($0.17) per share, for 2008. Product and service revenue and related
gross margin declines of $4.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, combined
with lower engineering development revenues of $3.9 million, were only partially
offset by reductions in operating expenses of $4.5 million. In addition,
declines in investment and other income of $1.1 million negatively impacted
normalized net loss in 2009 as compared to 2008.
Operating cash
consumption
Operating cash consumption (see
Non-GAAP Measures) for the three months ended March 31, 2009 increased 20% to
$11.0 million, compared to $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2008. The
higher operating cash consumption in the first quarter of 2009 was driven by
increased capital expenditures, a decline in investment income, lower product
and service gross margins and lower engineering development revenues. These
increases were partially offset by lower working capital requirements and lower
operating expenses. In addition, we made an additional investment of $5.0
million in EBARA BALLARD Corporation (“EBARA BALLARD”) during the first quarter
of 2009. This investment is not included in operating cash
consumption.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
ESTIMATES
Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP, which require us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our
consolidated financial statements. We have identified the policies below as
critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of
operations. The application of these and other accounting policies are described
in note 1 to the 2008 annual consolidated financial statements. Our preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ from those estimates.


REVENUE RECOGNITION
We earn revenues under certain
contracts to provide engineering development services. These contracts provide
for the payment for services based on our achieving defined milestones or on the
performance of work under our product development programs. Revenues are
recognized under these contracts based on assessments of progress achieved
against these milestones or on the proportionate performance method of
accounting. There is a risk that a customer may ultimately disagree with our
assessment of the progress achieved against milestones or that our estimates of
the percentage of work completed could change. Should this occur, the revenues
recognized in the period might require adjustment in a subsequent
period.
Under the terms of certain other
contracts under which we earn product and engineering service revenue, revenue
is recognized based on the proportion of performance completed. There is a risk
that estimated costs to complete a contract might change, which may result in an
adjustment to previously recognized revenues. 
During the three months ended
March 31, 2009, there were no material adjustments to engineering development
revenue and product and engineering service revenue relating to revenue
recognized in a prior period.
WARRANTY PROVISION
A provision for warranty costs is
recorded on product sales at the time of shipment. In establishing the accrued
warranty liabilities, we estimate the likelihood that products sold will
experience warranty claims and the cost to resolve claims received. In making
such determinations, we use estimates based on the nature of the contract and
past and projected experience with the products. Should these estimates prove to
be incorrect, we may incur costs different from those provided for in our
warranty provisions. During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, we
recorded provisions to accrued warranty liabilities of $0.3 million and $0.2
million, respectively, for new product sales.
We review our warranty assumptions
and make adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities quarterly based on the
latest information available and to reflect the expiry of contractual
obligations. Adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities are recorded in cost of
product and service revenues. As a result of these reviews, we recorded
adjustments that reduced accrued warranty liabilities by nil and $0.1 million,
respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008. The
adjustments to reduce accrued warranty liabilities were primarily due to
contractual expirations and improved lifetimes of our fuel cell
products.
INVENTORY PROVISION
In determining the lower of cost
and net realizable value of our inventory and establishing the appropriate
provision for inventory obsolescence, we estimate the likelihood that inventory
carrying values will be affected by changes in market pricing or demand for our
products and by changes in technology or design which could make inventory on
hand obsolete or recoverable at less than cost. We perform regular reviews to
assess the impact of changes in technology and design, sales trends and other
changes on the carrying value of inventory. Where we determine that such changes
have occurred and will have a negative impact on the value of inventory on hand,
appropriate provisions are made. If there is a subsequent increase in the value
of inventory on hand, reversals of previous write-downs to net realizable value
are made. Unforeseen changes in these factors could result in additional
inventory provisions, or reversals of previous provisions, being required.
During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, inventory provisions of
$0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, were recorded as a charge to cost
of product and service revenues.


INVESTMENTS
We have made strategic investments
in other companies or partnerships that are developing technology with potential
fuel cell applications. Each of these investments is either accounted for by the
equity method or carried at cost, depending on whether or not we have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the company or partnership. We
regularly review such investments and should circumstances indicate that an
impairment of value has occurred that is other than temporary, we would record
this impairment in the earnings of the current period. Given that these entities
are in the development stage, there is significant judgment required in
determining whether an impairment has occurred in the value of these investments
that must be recorded. During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, no
write-downs of our investments were recorded.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND
GOODWILL
In accordance with Canadian GAAP,
we do not amortize goodwill, and we amortize intangible assets over periods
ranging from five to 15 years. At least annually, we review the carrying value
of our intangible assets and goodwill by segment for potential impairment. Among
other things, this review considers the fair value of the business based on
discounted estimated cash flows. If circumstances indicate that impairment in
the value of these assets has occurred, we would record this impairment in the
earnings of the current period. During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and
2008, no write-downs of intangible assets or goodwill were recorded.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
AND DEVELOPMENTS
Convergence with International
Financial Reporting Standards
In February 2008, Canada’s
Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) confirmed that Canadian GAAP, as used by
public companies, will be converged with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) effective January 1, 2011. The transition from Canadian GAAP
to IFRS will be applicable for us for the first quarter of 2011 when we will
prepare both the current and comparative financial information using
IFRS.
While IFRS uses a conceptual
framework similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant differences on
recognition, measurement and disclosures. We commenced our IFRS conversion
project in the second quarter of 2008. The project consists of four phases:
awareness raising; assessment; design; and implementation. With the assistance
of an external expert advisor, we have completed the awareness-raising phase and
have begun a high level review of the major differences between Canadian GAAP
and IFRS (the assessment phase). It is expected that this work will be completed
during 2009. Subsequently, we will initiate the design phase, which will involve
establishing issue-specific work teams to focus on generating options and making
recommendations in identified areas. We will also establish a communications
plan, begin to develop staff training programs, and evaluate the impacts of the
IFRS transition on other business activities.


Business
Combinations
In January 2009, the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued new recommendations for
Business Combinations (CICA Handbook Section 1582), Consolidations
(CICA Handbook Section 1601) and Non-Controlling Interests (CICA
Handbook Section 1602). Section 1582 specifies a number of changes, including:
an expanded definition of a business; a requirement to measure all business
acquisitions at fair value; a requirement to measure non-controlling interests
at fair value; and a requirement to recognize acquisition related costs as
expenses. Section 1601 establishes standards for the preparation of consolidated
financial statements. Section 1602 specifies that non-controlling interests be
treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item
outside of equity. The new standards are harmonized with IFRS and will become
effective in 2011. We anticipate adopting these standards in 2011 and are
currently determining the impacts of the standards on our consolidated financial
statements.
RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009 were $8.1
million, a $8.0 million, or 50% decrease from the same period in 2008,
reflecting decreases in product and service revenues of 33% and the elimination
of light-duty automotive and 1kw residential cogeneration engineering
development revenue. The discontinuance of engineering development revenue was
expected and is consistent with our transition to commercial
production.

Fuel Cell Products revenues for
the three months ended March 31, 2009 of $3.9 million are essentially flat
compared to the prior years quarter of $4.0 million. Increased bus module
revenues as a result of the Transport of London fuel cell bus program and
similar residential cogeneration revenues were offset by lower sales in the
material handling and back-up power markets. Fuel Cell Products shipments
totaled 190 units in the first quarter of 2009, compared to 254 units in the
first quarter of 2008.
Fuel Cell Products engineering
development revenues were nil for the three months ended March 31, 2009, a $2.3
million, or 100%, reduction compared to the first quarter of 2008. The absence
of Fuel Cell Products engineering development revenues in 2009 was expected due
to the completion of our 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell program in the
third quarter of 2008. The costs associated with these engineering development
revenues are included in research and development expenses.


Contract Automotive product and
service revenues decreased $3.3 million, or 64%, for the three months ended
March 31, 2009, compared to the first quarter of 2008. Increased automotive
service revenues derived primarily from testing and engineering services to AFCC
were more than offset by lower contract manufacturing of light-duty automotive
fuel cell products at lower prices to AFCC, Daimler and Ford.
Contract Automotive engineering
development revenues were nil for the three months ended March 31, 2009, a $1.6
million, or 100%, reduction compared to the first quarter of 2008. The absence
of Contract Automotive engineering development revenues in 2009 was expected due
to the closing of the AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008. The costs associated
with these engineering development revenues are included in research and
development expenses.
Material Products revenues for the
three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased $0.6 million, or 21%, compared to
2008, due primarily to decreased volumes of carbon friction material products as
a result of the continued slow down in the U.S. automotive industry which were
only partially offset by growth in sales of GDL material for fuel cell
products.
Cost of product and service
revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009 were $7.9
million, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in
2008. The decline is due primarily to the 33% decline in overall product and
services revenues in the period and is driven by lower shipments of light-duty
automotive products to AFCC, Daimler and Ford.
Gross margins on product and
service revenues declined in the three months ended March 31, 2009 to $0.2
million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2008. Increased margins
as a result of the Transport of London fuel cell bus program were offset by
higher unabsorbed overhead charges in all segments due to the overall revenue
decline.
Research and product
development expenses were $7.8 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2009, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 33%, compared to the same period
in 2008. This decline in expenditures is due primarily to the disposition of our
automotive fuel cell development programs on the closing of the AFCC Transaction
on January 31, 2008, combined with the positive effects of a weaker Canadian
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which more than offset increased investment
in our Fuel Cell Products programs.
Included in research and product
development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 were
costs of nil and $2.5 million, respectively, related to our achievement of
predefined milestones for our customers under the development programs for which
we will earn engineering development revenue.
General and
administrative expenses were $4.3
million for three months ended March 31, 2009, an increase of $0.4 million, or
10%, compared to the same period in 2008. The increase in 2009 is due to
severance and related costs of approximately $1.1 million as a result of a 7%
work-force reduction effected in March 2009, partially offset by lower labour
and insurance expenditures and the positive effects of a weaker Canadian dollar,
relative to the U.S. dollar.


Sales and marketing
expenses were $1.8 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008. Increased investment in sales and
marketing capacity in support of commercial efforts was offset by the positive
effects of a weaker Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar.
Depreciation and
amortization was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31,
2009, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 33%, compared to the same period in 2008.
Depreciation and amortization declined as some assets became fully depreciated
or amortized during 2008 and certain intangible assets were disposed of in the
AFCC Transaction.
Investment and other income
(loss) was a loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2009, compared to income of $0.2 million for the same period in 2008.
The following table provides a breakdown of our investment and other income and
foreign exchange gain for the reported periods:

Investment income was $0.3 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2009, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 77%,
compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease was a result of declining
interest rates combined with lower average cash balances in 2009 compared to
2008. We classify our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as
held-for-trading and measure these assets at fair value with changes in fair
value recognized in income. The fair values are determined directly by reference
to quoted market prices. During 2008 and into 2009, the investment market was
negatively impacted by liquidity and credit market concerns along with increased
concerns about a global economic slowdown. We continue to review our exposure to
these issues and have determined that there are no material impacts on our
investment portfolio.
Foreign exchange gains and losses
are attributable to the effect of the changes in the value of the Canadian
dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, on our Canadian dollar-denominated net
monetary assets and on outstanding foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell
Canadian dollars over the respective periods. The foreign exchange loss of $1.4
million for the first quarter of 2009 resulted primarily from the weakening of
the Canadian dollar during the quarter. Compared to the U.S. dollar, the
Canadian dollar has weakened from 1.22 at December 31, 2008 to 1.26 at March 31,
2009. In addition to foreign exchange contracts, we hold Canadian dollar cash
and short-term investments to reduce the foreign currency risk inherent in
expenditures denominated in Canadian dollars. Our foreign denominated cash and
short-term investments do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore foreign
exchange gains and losses are recognized when they occur.
Gain on assets held for
sale were $96.9 million for the three months ended March 31,
2008, reflecting the disposition of automotive assets pursuant to the AFCC
Transaction.


Equity in loss of associated
companies was $2.9 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 and relate to our share of the losses
of EBARA BALLARD. EBARA BALLARD is focused on the introduction of its next
generation system product for the residential cogeneration market in
Japan.
CASH FLOWS, LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES
CASH FLOWS
Cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments were $66.7 million as at March 31, 2009, compared to
$85.4 million at the end of 2008. The decrease of $18.7 million in 2009 was
driven by a net loss (excluding non-cash items) of $13.4 million, an advance to
EBARA BALLARD of $5.0 million and net capital expenditures of $2.2 million
partially offset by working capital cash inflows of $4.6 million.
For the three months ended March
31, 2009, working capital requirements resulted in cash inflows of $4.6 million
compared to cash inflows of $0.9 million for the corresponding period in 2008.
In the first quarter of 2009, net cash inflows of $4.6 million were driven by
lower accounts receivable of $6.4 million due to the timing of collections of
our product and engineering development revenues, combined with higher accounts
payable and accrued liabilities of $2.2 due primarily to accrued severance costs
of $1.1 million and amounts payable related to increased capital expenditures.
These working capital inflows in the first quarter of 2009 were partially offset
by cash outflows from higher inventory expenditures of $3.3 million primarily as
a result of the planned build-up of inventory for the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic
and Transport of London fuel cell bus programs. Working capital inflows during
the first quarter of 2008 of $0.9 million were driven by lower accounts
receivable of $1.1 million and lower inventory of $2.1 million partially offset
by cash outflows from reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of
$2.9 million, primarily reflecting the payment of 2007 employee
bonuses.
Investing activities resulted in
cash inflows of $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009, compared
to cash outflows of $21.6 million for the corresponding period in 2008. Changes
in short-term investments resulted in cash inflows of $7.6 million in the first
quarter of 2009 as compared to inflows of $40.5 million in the first quarter of
2008 as balances changed between cash equivalents and short-term investments as
we made investment decisions with regards to the term of investments in response
to changes in yield curves in order to improve our investment returns. Balances
also changed in response to the $33.8 million net proceeds from the Arrangement
with Superior Plus Income Fund received on December 31, 2008, and in response to
the $60 million funding requirement to close the AFCC Transaction on January 31,
2008. Net capital spending of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2009 relates
primarily to building production capacity, compared to net capital spending in
the first quarter of 2008 of $1.1 million relating primarily to manufacturing,
test and computer equipment. The cash flows used for other investing activities
in the first quarter of 2009 of $5.2 million include an advance to EBARA BALLARD
of $5.0 million and an investment in Chrysalix Energy Limited Partnership of
$0.2 million.
Financing activities resulted in
cash outflows of $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and
represent closing costs paid in 2009 which were accrued at December 31, 2008 on
the closing of the Arrangement.
As at April 27, 2009, we had
83,940,682 common shares issued and outstanding and stock options to purchase
6,008,448 of our common shares outstanding.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES
As at March 31, 2009, we had cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $66.7 million. We will use
our funds to meet net funding requirements for the development and
commercialization of products in our target markets. This includes research and
product development for fuel cells and material products, the purchase of
equipment for our manufacturing and testing facilities, the further development
of business systems and low-cost manufacturing processes and the further
development of our marketing, product distribution and service
capabilities.
At this stage of our development,
we expect to record losses for at least the next few years as we continue to
make significant investments in research and product and market development
activities necessary to commercialize our products. Our actual funding
requirements will vary based on the factors noted above, our relationships with
our lead customers and strategic partners, our success in developing new
channels to market and relationships with customers, our success in generating
revenue growth from near-term product opportunities, our working capital
requirements, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the progress and results of our
research, development and demonstration programs.
Our financial strategy is to
manage our cash resources with strong fiscal discipline, focus on markets with
high product and service revenue growth potential, license technology in cases
where it is advantageous to us, and access available government funding for
research and development projects. Our current financing principle is to
maintain cash balances sufficient to fund at least six quarters of operating
cash consumption at all times. We believe that our current cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, combined with our ability to potentially
monetize other assets, including our interest in AFCC through the share purchase
agreement with Ford (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements & Contractual
Obligations section), are sufficient to meet our planned growth and development
activities for the foreseeable future without the need to access public market
financing. However, circumstances could change which would make it advantageous
for us to access additional capital.
OUTLOOK
The world’s financial crisis and
liquidity concerns continued through the first quarter of 2009 and the resultant
economic slowdown has deepened. Reduced consumer demand, lower availability of
credit and reduced access to capital markets has impacted demand for fuel cell
products from some of our customers as well as the end users of some of our
products. This economic slowdown has been most acute in the automotive sector
and has negatively impacted revenues in our supporting Contract Automotive and
Material Products business segments. While our core Fuel Cell Products segment
is facing increased risks, this segment is essentially flat in the quarter and
we continue to expect revenue from this core business to increase in 2009, as
compared to 2008.
As a result of these increased
pressures and increased risks, we now expect overall revenues for 2009 to be at
the low end of our guidance range of between $68 million to $78 million,
compared to $59.6 million in 2008.


We continue to expect that core
Fuel Cell Products revenue will increase in 2009, as compared to 2008, due to
volume increases in our back-up power, bus and material handling markets as a
result of our announced agreements with: ACME (subject to product acceptance
test in the fourth quarter of 2009) and Dantherm, the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic
fuel cell bus program, the Transport of London fuel cell bus program, our
customer Plug Power’s supply agreement with Central Grocers, and new
opportunities in the distributed power generation sector that we are currently
pursuing. This anticipated increase in Fuel Cell Products revenue is expected to
be partially offset by declines in Fuel Cell Products service revenues due to
the completion of our existing engineering service government contracts in the
material handling and back-up power markets, and declines in Fuel Cell Products
engineering development revenues due to the completion of our 1kW residential
cogeneration fuel cell development program in the third quarter of 2008. We also
expect that residential cogeneration product revenues in 2009 will see continued
downward pressure as the program remains in the development stage of the
Japanese government trial program.
As a result of the above noted
automotive sector impacts, we now expect that supporting business revenues will
decline more than initially anticipated in 2009, as compared to 2008, due
primarily to reduced technical services and contract manufacturing for AFCC,
Daimler and Ford in our non-core Contract Automotive segment. In addition,
Material Products revenue is expected to see downward pressure due to lower
carbon friction material product sales to automotive manufacturers.
We continue to expect to ship
4,000 fuel cell units in 2009, as compared to 1,855 units in 2008. However,
given the ongoing market risks and uncertainties, our previous guidance shipment
mix of 1,000 material handling units, 2,500 back-up power units and 500
residential cogeneration units could change.
We continue to expect our
operating cash consumption (see Non-GAAP Measures) for 2009 to be between $17
million to $27 million, compared to $29.3 million in 2008, assuming no material
fluctuations in U.S. / Canadian dollar exchange rates. The anticipated
improvement in operating cash consumption for 2009 is based on our expectation
of an increase in gross margins as a result of increased product sales, combined
with additional reductions in operating expenses, which we believe will more
than offset our increased investment in manufacturing capacity. As a result of
the timing of capital expenditures, working capital impacts related to the B.C.
Transit 2010 Olympic and Transport of London fuel cell bus programs, and the
payment of 2008 employee bonuses in the first half of 2009, operating cash
consumption is expected to be higher in the first half of 2009, as compared to
the second half of the year. In March 2009, we initiated a 7% workforce
reduction, a Company-wide salary freeze and numerous other cost containment
measures to assist in the achievement of this goal.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
& CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
We maintain a 19.9% interest in
AFCC which is subject to a share purchase agreement under which Ford, either at
our option or Ford’s election, may purchase our interest in AFCC at any time on
or after January 31, 2013 for $65 million plus interest accruing at LIBOR from
January 31, 2008. The purchase may take place earlier than January 31, 2013 if
certain other events occur. Under Canadian GAAP, this share purchase agreement
is considered a derivative instrument and is therefore measured and recorded at
its fair value on the closing of the AFCC Transaction. We have recorded this
derivative at its fair value of $1 representing the difference between the
discounted present value of the share purchase agreement on closing and the
value of the underlying transferred AFCC assets. This derivative instrument is
carried at cost and is not marked to market each reporting period, as we do not
believe it is possible to regularly determine its reliable fair value. If the
share purchase agreement were to be held to maturity and exercised on January
31, 2013, we anticipate that we would receive proceeds of approximately $68
million (based on current interest rates) and record an estimated gain of
approximately $67 million on the sale of our remaining 19.9% interest in AFCC.
If we were to monetize this share purchase agreement prior to its maturity date
of January 31, 2013, the amount of proceeds received would be subject to a
number of variables including Ford’s cost of borrowing, expected future LIBOR
rates, time remaining to January 31, 2013 and general market and other
conditions. Under present economic conditions, we believe that these factors
would result in a significant discount to the face value of the share purchase
agreement.
Periodically, we use foreign
exchange contracts to manage our exposure to currency rate fluctuations and
platinum forward purchase contracts to manage our exposure to platinum price
fluctuations. We record these contracts at their fair value as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our
consolidated statements of operations. At March 31, 2009, we had outstanding
forward exchange contracts to sell a total of Canadian $6 million at an average
rate of $1.12 Canadian per $1.00 United States dollar, resulting in an
unrealized loss of $0.6 million. In addition, we had outstanding platinum
forward purchase contracts to purchase a total of $1.6 million of platinum at an
average rate of $890 per troy ounce, resulting in an unrealized gain of $0.4
million.
During 2009, a Canadian
governmental agency agreed to terminate potential royalties payable of $4.2
million (Cdn. $5.3 million) in respect of future sales of fuel cell-based
stationary power products under a historic development program. As a result,
total royalties payable in respect of future sales of fuel cell-based stationary
power products under two development programs with certain Canadian government
agencies have been reduced from up to a maximum of $38.9 million (Cdn. $49.0
million) at December 31, 2008 to a maximum of $34.7 million (Cdn. $43.7 million)
at March 31, 2009. To March 31, 2009, we have made total royalty payments of
$4.2 million (Cdn. $5.3 million) against this potential obligation, including
royalty payments of $0.1 million (Cdn. $0.1 million) in 2009. The conditions
under which these royalties become payable are described in more detail in note
14 to the 2008 annual consolidated financial statements.
As at March 31, 2009, there were
no other significant changes in our contractual obligations and commercial
commitments from those reported in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis for
the year ended December 31, 2008.
RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS
Related parties include
shareholders with a significant ownership interest in us, together with their
subsidiaries and affiliates, our key management personnel and our
equity-accounted investees. Revenues and costs recognized from such transactions
reflect the prices and terms of sale and purchase transactions with related
parties, which are in accordance with normal trade practices. Related parties
include EBARA BALLARD and EBARA Corporation, and prior to the closing of the
AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008, Daimler and Ford. AFCC is not considered
to be a related party, as we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over AFCC’s strategic operating, investing or financing
policies.


We earn revenues from related
parties from the sale of products and services and from engineering development
revenues. We provide funding to related parties for the purposes of conducting
research and development on our behalf. We have also purchased intellectual
property and obtained licenses from, and granted licenses to, related parties.
As a result of the AFCC Transaction, related party transactions have been
reduced.

Summary of Quarterly
Results: There
were no significant seasonal variations in our quarterly results. Variations in
our net income (loss) for the above periods were affected primarily by the
following factors:

  Product and service
  revenues: Variations in
  fuel cell product revenues reflect the timing of our customers’ fuel cell
  vehicle, bus and field trial deployments. Product revenues in the fourth
  quarter of 2008 were positively impacted by $6.0 million by the commencement
  of shipments of fuel cell bus modules related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic
  fuel cell bus program. Revenue from testing and engineering services to AFCC
  commenced in the first quarter of 2008. 
  Engineering development
  revenue: Variations in
  engineering development revenue reflect the timing of work performed and the
  achievements of milestones under the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell
  development program and from light duty automotive and fuel cell bus programs.
  As a result of the AFCC Transaction, there were no light duty automotive fuel
  program engineering development revenues subsequent to January 2008. In
  addition, the 1kW residential cogeneration fuel cell development program was
  completed in the third quarter of 2008. Engineering development revenue in the
  first three quarters of 2008 was positively impacted by $1.0 million of
  revenue related to the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus
  program.



  Operating expenditures:
  Operating expenses have declined in the four quarters of 2008 and the first
  quarter of 2009 due to the impact of the AFCC Transaction. Operating expenses
  also reflect changes in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S.
  dollar. Operating expenses increased in the first quarter of 2009 due to
  severance and related costs of $1.1 million due to cost containment measures
  and increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to severance and related costs
  of $4.1 million incurred in conjunction with the AFCC
  Transaction. 
  Depreciation and
  amortization:
  Depreciation and amortization has declined for the first quarter of 2009 and
  the four quarters of 2008 as several assets became fully depreciated or
  amortized during 2007 and certain intangible assets were disposed of in the
  AFCC Transaction. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the
  fourth quarter of 2007 due to the acceleration of amortization on expired
  patents. Depreciation and amortization has declined for the first three
  quarters of 2007 as a significant amount of intangible assets acquired in 2001
  became fully amortized in 2006. 
  Investment and other income:
  Investment income has continually
  declined for the last eight quarters due to declines in our cash equivalents
  and short-term investment portfolios and declines in interest rates.
  Investment and other income was positively impacted in the second, third and
  fourth quarters of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008 by foreign exchange
  gains of $4.2 million, $3.3 million, $0.7 million, and $1.0 million,
  respectively, and was negatively impacted in the first quarter of 2009 and the
  first, third and fourth quarters of 2008 by foreign exchange losses of $1.4
  million, $1.3 million, $0.5 million, and $2.9 million, respectively, due to
  fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, on our
  Canadian dollar-denominated cash and short-term investments and on our
  outstanding foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell Canadian dollars. Other
  income increased in the four quarters of 2008 due to the provision of
  administrative services to AFCC. 
  Loss on disposal and write-down of
  long-lived assets: The net loss for the
  fourth quarter of 2008 was negatively impacted by a $3.0 million write-down of
  our investment in Chrysalix and the third quarter of 2007 was negatively
  impacted by a $4.6 million write-down of our investment in Advanced Energy
  Technology Inc. 
  Gain on sale of assets held for sale:
  The net income for the first quarter of
  2008 was significantly impacted by a $96.8 million gain on the sale of assets
  pursuant to the AFCC Transaction.
RISKS &
UNCERTAINTIES
Risks and uncertainties related to
economic and industry factors are described in detail in our 2009 Annual
Information Form and remain substantially unchanged.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
During the most recent interim
period ending March 31, 2009, we did not make any significant changes in the
design of internal controls over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.


NON-GAAP
MEASURES
We use certain non-GAAP measures
to assist in assessing our financial performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP
measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are
therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other
companies. A description of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to financial
statement line items for the periods indicated are as follows:
Normalized net
loss measures our net loss after
excluding items that are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal
continued operating activity of the business. Gains on sale of assets held for
sale, losses from discontinued operations, write-downs of long-lived assets and
severance and related costs are not considered part of our core activities, and
are either unusual or are expected to occur infrequently. Therefore we have
removed these in our calculation of normalized net loss. We believe normalized
net loss assists investors in assessing our performance.

Operating cash
consumption measures the amount of

financing and investing activities except for net additions to property, plant
and equipment. We believe operating cash consumption assists investors in
assessing our requirements to fund operations.

    1.
    
    Basis of
      presentation:
  
     
  
     
          
    The accompanying
      financial information reflects the same accounting policies and methods of
      application as the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements for the
      year ended December 31, 2008, except for the changes in accounting
      policies described in note 2. The accompanying financial information does
      not include all disclosure required under Canadian generally accepted
      accounting principles (“GAAP”) because certain information included in the
      Corporation’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
      December 31, 2008 has not been included in this report. These consolidated
      financial statements are unaudited but reflect all adjustments required
      for the fair presentation in accordance with GAAP and should be read in
      conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
      December 31, 2008.
  
     
  
     
    
    Certain
      comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the basis of
      presentation adopted in the current period.
  
     
  
    2.
    
    Changes in
      accounting policies and anticipated changes in accounting
      standards:
  
     
  
     
    
    In February 2008,
      Canada’s Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) confirmed the date of
      changeover from GAAP to International Financial Reporting Standards
      (“IFRS”). Canadian publicly accountable enterprises must adopt IFRS for
      their interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years
      beginning on or after January 1, 2011.
  
     
  
     
    
    While IFRS uses a
      conceptual framework similar to Canadian GAAP, there are significant
      differences on recognition, measurement and disclosures. The Corporation,
      with the assistance of an external expert advisor, has begun a high level
      review of the major differences between Canadian GAAP and IFRS. This work
      is expected to be substantially complete in 2009.
  
     
  
     
    
    In January 2009,
      the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued new
      recommendations for Business
      Combinations (CICA Handbook
      Section 1582), Consolidations (CICA
      Handbook Section 1601) and Non-Controlling Interests (CICA Handbook Section 1602). Section 1582 specifies a number of
      changes, including: an expanded definition of a business, a requirement to
      measure all business acquisitions at fair value, a requirement to measure
      non-controlling interests at fair value, and a requirement to recognize
      acquisition related costs as expenses. Section 1601 establishes standards
      for the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Section 1602
      specifies that non-controlling interests be treated as a separate
      component of equity, instead of a liability or other item outside of
      equity. The new standards will become effective in 2011. The Corporation
      anticipates adopting these standards in 2011 and is currently determining
      the impact of the standards on the Corporation’s consolidated financial
      statements.

    3.
    
    Non-dilutive
      financing:
  
     
  
     
          
    On December 31,
      2008, the Corporation completed a restructuring transaction with Superior
      Plus Income Fund (“Superior Plus”) to reorganize the Corporation’s
      business under a Plan of Arrangement (the “Arrangement”). Pursuant to the
      Arrangement, Superior Plus transferred $38,029,000 (CDN $46,319,000) to
      the Corporation’s parent company (“Old Ballard”). Old Ballard subsequently
      transferred all of its assets and liabilities (including the net cash
      proceeds, but excluding Old Ballard’s historic Canadian income tax carry
      forward attributes), to a new wholly-owned company (“the Corporation”).
      Old Ballard’s shareholders exchanged their shares, on a one-for-one basis,
      for shares of the Corporation. The Corporation is carrying on the full
      scope of Old Ballard’s business operations, and holds all rights to
      intellectual property, as held by Old Ballard before the completion of the
      Arrangement. As such, all references to the Corporation in these
      Consolidated Financial Statements include Old Ballard for matters
      occurring before the Arrangement.
  
     
  
     
    
    As the transfer
      of the business assets, liabilities and operations from Old Ballard to the
      Corporation represented a transaction with no change in shareholder
      ownership, the transaction was accounted for using continuity of interest
      accounting. Pursuant to continuity of interest accounting, the assets
      transferred and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values
      as reported by Old Ballard immediately prior to the completion of the
      Arrangement. As a result, the net cash proceeds were recorded as a credit
      to shareholders’ equity.
  
     
  
     
    
    In addition, as
      the future income tax benefits of Old Ballard’s Canadian non-capital
      losses, capital losses, scientific research and development expenditures
      and investment tax credits generated through to the date of the completion
      of the Arrangement are not available to the Corporation after the
      completion of the Arrangement, the gross future income tax assets related
      to these Canadian tax pools was reduced to nil, with a corresponding
      reduction of the related valuation
allowance.

    Disposition of Automotive
      Assets:
  
       
  
    
          
    On January 31, 2008, the
      Corporation completed the sale of its automotive fuel cell research and
      development assets (“the AFCC Transaction”) to Daimler AG (“Daimler”),
      Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) and a newly created private corporation, AFCC
      Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. (“AFCC”). AFCC, which is controlled
      by Daimler and Ford, was created to carry on the development of automotive
      fuel cells for Daimler and Ford. Under the terms of the AFCC Transaction,
      the Corporation transferred to Daimler, Ford and AFCC its automotive
      patents, automotive fuel cell test equipment, automotive fuel cell
      inventory, $60,000,000 in cash, all automotive fuel cell warranty
      liabilities, all automotive fuel cell development contracts between
      Ballard, Daimler and Ford, 80.1% of the outstanding shares of AFCC (note
      5), 112 personnel and a royalty free, sub-licensable license to the
      Corporation’s remaining intellectual property for use in automotive
      applications. In exchange, Daimler and Ford returned to the Corporation an
      aggregate of 34,261,298 of its common shares valued at $173,900,000, one
      Class A share and one Class B share, collectively representing Daimler and
      Ford’s entire direct and indirect equity interest in the Corporation.
      These shares were then cancelled. 
      On January 31, 2008, the Corporation
      recorded a gain of $96,916,000 on the closing of the AFCC Transaction. The
      final net gain was subsequently adjusted to $96,845,000 based on final
      disposal costs.

      Chrysalix Energy Limited
      Partnership (“Chrysalix”) is recorded at the lower of cost and estimated
      net realizable value. As of December 31, 2008, the Corporation recorded a
      write down to adjust the carrying value of Chrysalix to its net realizable
      value of $500,000. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the
      Corporation made additional investments of $156,000 in
      Chrysalix.
  
    
          
      
  
    
    
    The Corporation
      maintains a 19.9% interest in AFCC which is carried at cost and is subject
      to a share purchase agreement under which Ford, either at the option of
      the Corporation or Ford’s election, will purchase the Corporation’s
      interest in AFCC at any time after January 31, 2013 for $65,000,000 plus
      interest accruing at LIBOR. The purchase may take place earlier than
      January 31, 2013 if certain events occur. The Corporation has no
      obligation to fund any of AFCC’s operating expenses. This share purchase
      agreement is considered to be a derivative instrument and was recorded at
      its fair value of $1 on the closing of the AFCC Transaction.

    Long-term
      liabilities (cont’d):
  
       
  
    
          
    During the three
      months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, $2,895,000 and $2,869,000, respectively, was
      recorded against the investment in EBARA BALLARD, representing the
      Corporation’s proportionate share of EBARA BALLARD’s equity loss. The
      Corporation’s 49% interest in EBARA BALLARD is accounted for using the
      equity method. As the Corporation’s proportionate share of losses from
      EBARA BALLARD has exceeded the Corporation’s net funded investment, the
      net investment has been presented in long-term liabilities. During the
      three months ended March 31, 2009, the Corporation made an additional
      investment in EBARA BALLARD of $5,000,000 comprising of a convertible note
      receivable, reducing the net liability balance.
  
    
    
      
  
    
    
    During the three
      months ended March 31, 2009, deferred revenue of $4,250,000 was
      reclassified from long-term liabilities to current
  liabilities.
The Corporation maintains a defined
benefit pension plan for employees in the United States. The benefits under the
pension plan are based on years of service and salary levels. Certain employees
are also eligible for post-retirement healthcare, life insurance and other
benefits. During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, $116,000 and
$125,000, respectively, was recorded as defined benefit expense of the
Corporation’s defined benefit pension plan and other benefit plan, in
aggregate.

      value accounting for stock options.
  
    
    
      
  
    
    
    During the three
      months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, options to purchase 1,000,497 and
      675,612 common shares, respectively, were granted with a weighted average
      fair value of $0.65 and $2.81, respectively, and vesting periods of two to
      three years. The fair value of options issued during the period was

    Segmented
      financial information:
  
       
  
    
          
    For 2009, the
      Corporation’s market segments were reassessed due to the increased focus
      on key growth opportunities with near-term commercial prospects in core
      fuel cell markets. The Corporation’s business operates in three market
      segments: Fuel Cell Products, Contract Automotive, and Material Products.
      The Fuel Cell Products market segment is the Corporation’s core segment
      and includes activities relating to the design, development, manufacture,
      sale and servicing of fuel cell products for motive power (consisting of
      the material handling and bus markets) and stationary power (consisting of
      the back-up power and residential cogeneration markets) applications. The
      Corporation’s business activities in the Contract Automotive market
      segment include contract manufacturing of light-duty automotive fuel cell
      products and testing and engineering services provided primarily to AFCC,
      Daimler and Ford. The Corporation’s Material Products segment designs,
      develops, manufactures and sells carbon fiber products primarily to
      automotive manufacturers for automotive transmissions and gas diffusion
      layers for the fuel cell industry. The comparative figures have been
      reclassified to conform to the segmented disclosure adopted in the current
      year.
  
    
    
      
  
    
    
    Segment revenues and
      segment income (loss) represent the primary financial measures used by
      senior management in assessing performance and allocating resources, and
      include the revenues, cost of product and service revenues and expenses
      for which management is held accountable. Segment expenses include
      research and product development costs directly related to individual
      segments.
  
    
    
      
  
    
    
    
      Costs associated with shared
      services and other shared costs are allocated based on headcount and
      square footage. Corporate amounts include expenses for general research
      and product development, sales and marketing, and general and
      administrative, which apply generally across all segments and are reviewed
      separately by senior management. A significant portion of the
      Corporation’s production, testing and lab equipment, and facilities, as
      well as intellectual property, are common across the segments. Therefore,
      management does not classify asset information on a segmented basis.
      Instead, performance assessments of these assets and related resource
      allocations are done on a company-wide
basis.
