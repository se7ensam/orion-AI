MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

May 5, 2010

The following interim management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") updates our
annual MD&A included in our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, to which our
readers are referred. No update is provided where an item is not material or
there has been no material change from the discussion in our annual MD&A.
Forward-Looking Statements are outlined after the Outlook, Key Risks and
Uncertainties section of this press release. The major assumptions made in
preparing our second quarter guidance are outlined below and include, but are
not limited to:

- -    Wholesale and Retail fertilizer sales volumes higher than levels in the
     same quarter of 2009 and returning to more historically normal volumes;

- -    Wholesale fertilizer prices through the second quarter of 2010
     approximating current benchmark prices except for tonnes already committed
     under pricing programs;

- -    Retail fertilizer gross margin percentages significantly above 2009 second
     quarter levels;

- -    Farm income expectations and crop prices at levels sufficient to support
     demand for fertilizer and crop protection inputs;

- -    North American weather patterns supporting a normal fertilizer application
     season;

- -    The exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, expressed in U.S. dollars,
     averaging C$1.02 to U.S.$1.00;

- -    Average NYMEX gas pricing for the second quarter approximating $4.30/MMBtu;

- -    Stock-based compensation expense reflecting Agrium's stock price at the
     close of business on April 30, 2010 ($62.41 U.S.) and a $1 change in stock
     price equates to a $0.01 change in earnings per share;

- -    The exclusion from the guidance range of mark-to-market gains or losses on
     non-qualifying commodity hedge positions settling in future periods; and

- -    An effective tax rate for the second quarter of 32 percent.

2010 First Quarter Operating Results

NET LOSS

Agrium's 2010 first quarter consolidated net loss was $7-million ($0.04 diluted
loss per share), compared with a net loss of $60-million ($0.38 diluted loss per
share) for the same quarter of 2009. Net earnings before interest expense and
income taxes ("EBIT") was a loss of $21-million for the first quarter of 2010
compared with a loss of $56-million for the first quarter of 2009. A
reconciliation of EBIT to net loss is provided in the section "Non-GAAP
Measures". Consolidated gross profit in the first quarter of 2010 was
$361-million, an $88-million increase compared with the first quarter of 2009.
The increases in gross profit and EBIT for the first quarter of 2010 versus the
first quarter of 2009 were primarily driven by higher Wholesale potash sales
volumes and Retail crop nutrient gross profit. For discussion on the performance
of each business unit, see section "Business Segment Performance".



Expenses were $52-million higher in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the
same period last year largely due to a combination of the following items:

- -    $26-million change in potash profit taxes;

- -    $11-million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses; and

- -    $17-million increase in other expense (income).

/T/

An increase in tax recovery in the first quarter of 2010 is primarily due to the
recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit. The effective tax rate in
the first quarter of 2010, excluding the recognition of the tax benefit, is 30
percent, compared to 31 percent for the same quarter in 2009.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE

Retail

Retail's 2010 first quarter net sales were $1.1-billion, unchanged from the same
period last year. Gross profit increased to $162-million in the first quarter of
2010, compared to $142-million for the same period last year. Retail EBIT was a
loss of $72-million in the first quarter of 2010, an improvement over the loss
of $94-million in the first quarter of 2009.

Crop nutrient net sales were $371-million in the first quarter of 2010 down from
last year's $437-million for the same quarter due to lower crop nutrient prices.
While crop nutrient sales volumes were above last year's levels, they were below
anticipated volumes due to the late start of the 2010 spring



application season. Crop nutrient gross profit was $63-million this quarter, a
dramatic improvement over the $18-million in first quarter of 2009. Crop
nutrient margins returned to a more normalized first quarter level, averaging 17
percent, significantly above last year.

Crop protection net sales were $462-million in the first quarter of 2010, an 8
percent increase over the $426-million in sales for the same period last year,
as the wet weather and supplier programs promoted increased fungicide sales.
Gross profit this quarter was $69-million, compared with $77-million in 2009.
Crop protection product margins as a percentage of net sales were 15 percent for
the first quarter of 2010, as compared to 18 percent in the same period last
year. The gross profit and margin declines in the first quarter versus last year
were due to extensive supplier rebate programs promoting sales in the first
quarter. As is normal, crop protection product margins are expected to increase
in the second quarter due to a higher percentage of sales direct to growers and
custom-applied sales.(1)

Net sales of seed was $191-million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to
$148-million in the same period last year. Seed sales volumes were strong this
quarter, although gross profit was $15-million this quarter compared to
$25-million in the same quarter last year. The reduction in gross profit was due
to pricing pressure on seed products and the timing of rebate programs. It is
expected that a higher proportion of rebates this year will be recognized in the
second quarter of 2010.(1)

(1)  See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in our
     2010 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section
     "Management's Discussion and Analysis".

Application services and other net sales were $36-million and gross profit was
$15-million this quarter, both slightly lower than results from the same period
last year. The reduction was due to the late start to the spring application
season. The weather across most growing regions of the U.S. improved
dramatically in April of 2010, allowing applications and seeding to progress at
a rapid rate in April. Planting progress was well ahead of the past two years by
the end of April, 2010.

Retail selling expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were $200-million,
marginally higher than the $198-million last year. Selling expenses as a
percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 2010 was unchanged at 19
percent.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were $789-million for the first quarter of 2010, a record
for a first quarter, and 14 percent higher than the $695-million for the first
quarter of 2009. A rebound in fertilizer demand from both domestic and
international markets supported strong sales volumes, while gross margins
benefited from lower per unit cost of goods sold, as most of our facilities
operated at more normal levels in the first quarter of 2010.

The high sales volumes and strong margins resulted in Wholesale achieving the
second highest first quarter gross profit and EBIT in our history. Gross profit
for the first quarter of 2010 was $217-million compared to $117-million in the
same period for 2009. EBIT was $140-million for the first quarter of 2010,
$83-million higher than in the first quarter of 2009.



Gross profit for nitrogen was $72-million this quarter, compared to $55-million
in the same quarter last year. The increase in gross profit was due to a
combination of a 20 percent increase in per tonne margins due to lower cost of
product sold, and a 9 percent increase in sales volumes. Domestic urea and
ammonia prices were similar to last year levels, while UAN prices were lower
than the same period last year. The proportion of ammonia sales to the
higher-return agricultural markets is expected to increase significantly in the
second quarter and will support higher realized ammonia prices.(1) Cost of
product sold was $229 per tonne this quarter, 11 percent lower than the $258 per
tonne in the first quarter of 2009. The reduction in per tonne cost of product
sold was due primarily to higher operating rates at our international and
domestic facilities and higher sales volumes. The higher operating rates at our
facilities resulted in a smaller proportion of total fixed costs being charged
directly to cost of sales in the period.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $5.21/MMBtu in the first quarter of 2010
versus $5.64/MMBtu in the first quarter of 2009, including realized hedging
losses of $7-million for the first quarter of 2010 (or $0.21/MMBtu). The U.S.
benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the first quarter of 2010 was
$5.38/MMBtu, versus $4.86/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $4.27/MMBtu in
the fourth quarter of 2009. The AECO (Alberta) gas price basis was a $0.27/MMBtu
discount to NYMEX for the first quarter of 2010.

Gross profit for potash this quarter was $106-million, five times greater than
the $21-million in the first quarter of 2009. This significant increase in gross
profit was due to a dramatic rebound in sales volumes in the first quarter of
2010 reaching 534,000 tonnes this quarter, an increase of 458,000 tonnes
compared to the first quarter of 2009. The supply agreements with China and
India brought additional clarity and confidence to potash markets, while there
was resurgence in North American demand. The cost of product sold this quarter
was $140 per tonne, or almost half of the $277 per tonne recorded in the first
quarter of last year. The lower cost was almost entirely due to the Vanscoy
facility operating at near capacity for most of this quarter. Sales prices in
both domestic and international markets this quarter were about 50 percent lower
than the same period last year. The resulting gross margin was $199 per tonne
this quarter versus $276 per tonne for the first quarter of 2009.

     2010 first quarter MD&A and additional assumptions in the section
     "Management's Discussion and Analysis".

Phosphate gross profit was $18-million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to
$26-million for the same quarter last year. The decrease was due to lower
phosphate sales prices compared to the same period last year. Realized prices
tend to lag spot prices; in the first quarter of 2009 prices benefited from
forward sales made in late 2008 when prices were significantly higher, while in
the first quarter of 2010 realized prices lagged the increase in phosphate spot
prices. Phosphate sales volumes were 24 percent higher than the same quarter
last year, as demand for phosphate products increased substantially quarter over
quarter. Phosphate cost of product sold was $388 per tonne, a $42 per tonne
decline from the same period last year due to a lower cost of sulphur and a
significant increase in operating rates at our Conda facility, which lowered
fixed costs on a per tonne basis. The resulting gross margin per tonne was $72
per tonne versus $129 per tonne in the first quarter of 2009.



Gross profit for product purchased for resale was $12-million, $10-million
higher than the first quarter of 2009. The increase was due to a return to a
more normalized margin of $18 per tonne, versus the depressed level of $2 per
tonne for the same period last year given the high cost of carry over inventory.
Sales volumes of 677,000 tonnes were 206,000 tonnes lower than last year,
primarily due to cold weather which delayed the start of the season in both
Europe and North America.

First quarter Wholesale expenses were $18-million higher than last year. Potash
profit and capital taxes increased by approximately $26-million as a result of
higher potash gross profit and differences between 2009 and 2010 final potash
tax return adjustments. Unrealized net mark-to-market and realized losses from
commodity derivatives in the first quarter of 2010 were $61-million and
$7-million, respectively. These derivative losses were $4-million higher this
quarter than the same period last year.

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' (AAT) first quarter 2010 gross profit was $15-million
compared to $10-million in the first quarter of 2009. This increase in gross
profit was due primarily to the inclusion of the turf and ornamental retail
operations which were transferred in late 2009 from Retail to AAT and
contributed approximately $3-million in gross profit in the current quarter.
Though volumes sold were down in both the non-retail turf and ornamental and
agricultural product segments (including ESN), gross margins increased when
compared to the same period last year, when margins were negatively impacted by
declining nutrient prices. Volumes sold were lower this quarter versus last year
due largely to the late spring season experienced across most regions of the
U.S.

EBITDA was $3-million this quarter versus $6-million in the first quarter of
2009. Higher selling, general and administrative costs, as well as lower other
income, more than offset the increase in first quarter gross margin compared to
last year. Selling, general and administrative costs for AAT were $5-million
higher in the first quarter of 2010 than the same period last year due primarily
to the inclusion of costs related to the new turf and ornamental retail
operations transferred from Retail which were approximately $4-million for the
quarter. Lower earnings from our equity ownership in Hanfeng Evergreen Inc. and
foreign exchange translation costs contributed to other income being down
$2-million in the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the same period of
2009.

Other

EBIT for our other non-operating business unit for the first quarter of 2010 was
a loss of $88-million, a decrease of $68-million compared with a loss of
$20-million for the first quarter of 2009. The decrease reflected the expensing
of costs related to the CF acquisition incurred in 2009, deferral of gross
profit on Wholesale products sold to Retail that have yet to be sold to third
parties, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by a
comparably larger increase in our share price in the first quarter of 2010. The
decrease in EBIT was partially offset by gains realized from the sale of 1.2
million CF shares (see discussion under "Business Acquisition").

increase in use of cash

                
Source of cash     -    $18-million decrease resulting from a net loss of
                        $7-million adjusted for non-cash items, primarily
                        associated with unrealized losses on financial
                        instruments and foreign exchange.
Use of cash        -    $201-million increase in non-cash working capital. The
                        increase in non-cash working capital was primarily
                        driven by a lower increase in accounts payable and
                        accrued liabilities and higher increases in both
                        accounts receivable and inventories in the first quarter
                        of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. These
                        changes are consistent with the discussion under the
                        section "Financial Condition".

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently,
quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. Sales are concentrated
in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are
accumulated ahead of the application season. Cash collections generally occur
after the planting seasons in North and South America.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On March 11, 2010, the Company announced that it would no longer pursue an
acquisition of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ("CF") and allowed its offer for CF
to expire on March 22, 2010. Acquisition costs of $45-million, previously
recorded in prepaid expenses and deposits, were expensed on expiry of the offer.
In March 2010, the Company sold its investment in CF, consisting of 1.2 million
common shares, and recorded a pre-tax gain in other expenses of $52-million.
Unrealized gains on the shares had previously been recorded in other
comprehensive income.

Following termination of the CF offer, the conditional sale of 50 percent of the
Carseland nitrogen facility to Terra Industries Inc. was also terminated.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS ("IFRS")

Agrium is working towards completing the design and development phase of the
transition project. In Q1 2010, Agrium entered the implementation phase for a
number of standards. The Company's 2009 Annual Report includes a detailed
description of Agrium's IFRS transition plan activities, major milestones and
timelines.

/T/



Significant Differences Between IFRS
and Canadian GAAP                                    Estimated Impact
- --------------------------------------   ---------------------------------------
                                      
Employee Benefits
Agrium expects to use an optional        Estimated transition date impact:
exemption to recognize all cumulative    reduction of shareholders' equity and an
actuarial gains and losses through       increase in pension liabilities by the
its opening retained earnings on         unrecognized actuarial gains and losses
transition date.                         as at transition date

                                         Estimated future impact: none
Share-based payments
IFRS requires cash-settled,              Estimated transition date impact:
share-based awards to be measured at     reduction in shareholders' equity and an
fair value, while Canadian GAAP          increase in liabilities
allows these awards to be measured at
intrinsic value. In addition, Agrium     Estimated future impact: a continued
currently uses straight line             measurement difference between the
depreciation to recognize graded         intrinsic value and the fair value of
vesting stock based instruments,         share based awards
while IFRS requires that each
installment be accounted for as a
separate arrangement.




                                      
Income Taxes
Classification of future income tax      Estimated transition date impact:
under IFRS is non-current whereas        reclassifying all future income taxes to
Canadian GAAP splits future income       non-current is expected to result in a
taxes between current and non-current    decrease in current assets and a
components.                              decrease in non-current income tax
                                         liabilities

                                         Estimated future impact: remains a
                                         classification difference

Foreign Exchange
Agrium expects to use an optional        Estimated transition date impact:
exemption that permits a first time      reclassification from accumulated other
adopter to not comply with the           comprehensive income to retained
requirements for cumulative              earnings, resulting in a nil impact to
translation differences that existed     shareholders' equity
at the date of transition to IFRSs.
If this exemption is elected Agrium      Estimated future impact: none
is permitted to deem all cumulative
translation differences for all
foreign operations to be nil at
transition.



/T/

The above listing is not an exhaustive listing of changes on transition to IFRS.
Detailed analysis and quantification of these changes is continuing and approval
of accounting policies is expected in 2010. Agrium does not expect a significant
impact to its business activities nor to its operating cash flows from the
transition to IFRS.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary
measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net
earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings
before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of performance
because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of
historical performance for the different business segments. Similarly, financing
and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all business units on a
basis that is meaningful for comparison with other companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should
not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating activities
as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following table is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net loss as
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

BUSINESS RISKS

The information presented on enterprise risk management and business risks on
pages 81 - 88 in our 2009 Annual Report has not changed materially since
December 31, 2009.

CONTROLS & PROCEDURES

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES



Corn prices remain significantly higher than historic averages, despite record
global grain yields and recent price pressure from improved spring seeding
conditions. Soybean prices have been supported by record export demand. The
results of the USDA Prospective Plantings indicate U.S. growers intend to plant
88.8 million acres of corn and 78.1 million acres of soybeans, up 2.3 million
acres and 0.6 million acres respectively. Cotton area is expected to increase by
1.5 million acres over last year, to reach 10.5 million acres in 2010. With the
rapid seeding progress in April, many analysts believe corn and cotton area may
be even higher than the USDA report. The simultaneous increase in corn, soybean
and cotton area is expected to support crop input demand.

Crop margins continue to be well above average for most crops and indications
are U.S. growers have returned to more normal fertilizer application rates this
spring. The late start to the spring season and the carryover of some crop
protection products from last year resulted in limited price appreciation for
the crop protection product market, and to a lesser extent the seed segment in
the first quarter of 2010. However, the excellent weather for crop input
application in April 2010 and well above average seeding progress experienced
during the month is expected to result in improvement in the seed and crop
protection markets in the second quarter of 2010.

International urea prices have been under pressure over the past month, due in
part to delayed spring demand in Europe and the U.S. Buyers have been patient in
making additional purchasing while the market has declined. Looking forward,
North American applications are expected to be strong through the spring due to
the increase in corn and cotton area. In addition, Indian domestic urea demand
usually shows a seasonal increase in the middle of the year. Export supply
availability will increase in July as Chinese urea export tariffs are reduced to
7 percent. While there still remains a fair amount of uncertainty over what
Ukraine nitrogen producers will ultimately pay for their natural gas feedstock,
most industry analysts believe the price delivered to the plant is likely to
exceed $7/MMBtu, assuming the Ukraine government follows the recommendation of
the IMF to eliminate the direct gas subsidy to industrial users.

India locked in over 6 million tonnes of DAP to date for 2010 providing
underlying support to the phosphate market. U.S. spring applications are
expected to be strong, which are expected to keep inventories tight. U.S. DAP
and MAP inventories at the end of March were reported to be 34 percent below
March 2009 and 21 percent below the five-year average. Brazilian dry phosphate
imports in 2010 have so far remained below normal levels. Brazilian demand tends
to increase in the middle of the calendar year which would support the market
demand for this period.

Potash demand rebounded from the low levels reached in the 2008/09 fertilizer
year, with a significant recovery in demand from both domestic and international
markets. There was clarity resulting from the Chinese contracts for 2010, and
from the finalization of the Indian Nutrient Based Subsidy. India has been
purchasing significant potash volumes since the price was determined. North
American producer inventories continued to tighten, with the TFI report that
March 2010 potash inventories dropped 44 percent below March 2009 levels and 21
percent below the five-year average. Brazilian imports of potash were improved
significantly in the first quarter of 2010, relative to the depressed levels
experienced in 2009, although they still remained below the previous five year
average for the first quarter. Looking



ahead, Brazilian imports seasonally increase beginning in May and peak in the
third quarter.
