News Release


Ballard Reports Second Quarter 2010 Results


For Immediate Release – July 28, 2010


VANCOUVER, CANADA– Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDP) announced its financial results
for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010 today. All amounts are consolidated to include Dantherm
Power’s results and are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.


John Sheridan, President and CEO said “Ballard’s second quarter results are in line with our
expectations and full-year guidance. Revenue of $15.5 million represents growth of 31% over the
first quarter and 30% on a year-to-date basis. Our operating expense and cash flow improved
significantly over last year and, in addition, we further augmented cash reserves by $5 million in
July.”


Second Quarter 2010 Highlights


Growth:






     
    •
     
    Revenue of $15.5 million, for a total of $27.4 million on a year-to-date basis,
representing growth of 19% and 30%, respectively.









     
    •
     
    Fuel cell product shipments of 651 units, representing growth of 46% over the same
period last year. Year-to-date fuel cell product shipments of 979 units, representing
growth of 54% over the same period in 2009.









     
    •
     
    Twelve-month rolling order book of $31.0 million, an increase of $2.0 million over the
previous quarter.









     
    •
     
    Deployment of Dantherm Power backup power systems in the Wind Mobile telecom network,
meeting a 2010 growth milestone.









     
    •
     
    Signing of new supply agreement with Plug Power on July 15 through 2014, including
mutual exclusivity in North America.









     
    •
     
    Completion of the factory acceptance test of a utility-scale distributed generation
system for FirstEnergy Generation Corp.





Profitability:






     
    •
     
    Operating expense of $12.2 million. Excluding Dantherm Power, operating expense of $10.2
million represents an improvement of 21% year-over-year, despite the negative impact of a
14% stronger Canadian dollar.









     
    •
     
    EBITDA1 of ($9.3) million. A year-over-year comparison is not meaningful
given the one-time gain of $10.8 million in 2009 resulting from discontinuation of
EBARA-Ballard Corporation’s operations.









     
    •
     
    Net loss of $10.9 million or $0.13 per share. Excluding Dantherm Power, net loss is $9.8
million or $0.12 per share.









     
    •
     
    Cash flow from operations of ($12.1) million. Excluding Dantherm Power, cash flow from
operations was ($10.1) million, an improvement of 34% year-over-year. The company notes
that year-to-date cash flow from operations of ($21.6) million, excluding Dantherm Power,
includes over $10 million in non-trend items, specifically bonuses, severance and inventory
buildup.









     
    •
     
    Cash reserves at the end of second quarter of $73.6 million. Cash reserves were further
augmented by $5 million on July 9, 2010 through the monetization of the remaining tranche
of Ballard’s Share Purchase Agreement with Ford.





Guidance:






     
    •
     
    Ballard expects strong revenue in the second half of the year and reconfirms full-year
guidance of growth in excess of 35%.









     
    •
     
    Ballard continues to expect to achieve its goal of improving cash flow from operations
by 30% for the full year, excluding the cash flow impact of Dantherm Power and a negative
foreign exchange impact of approximately $4 million. However, timing impacts related to
working capital requirements in support of increased sales activity in the second half of
the year could result in increased pressures against this target.

Endnotes:

1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used to assist in assessing Ballard’s financial
performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by
GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
EBITDA measures net loss after excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation of
property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges.
EBITDA includes the impact attributable to Ballard’s controlling interest in Dantherm Power.
Ballard believes that EBITDA assists investors in assessing actual and future performance. For a
reconciliation of EBITDA to the Consolidated Financial Statements, please refer to Ballard’s
Management’s Discussion & Analysis,


Detailed Financial Results


Three months ended June 30, 2010


Revenues for the second quarter of 2010 increased 19%, or $2.5 million, to $15.5 million, compared
to $13.1 million for the second quarter of 2009. Increases in the supporting Material Products
segment of $3.6 million combined with increases in the Contract Automotive segment of $2.1 million
more than offset declines in the core Fuel Cell Products segment of $3.2 million.


In the core Fuel Cell Products business segment, second quarter of 2010 revenues declined 34%, or
$3.2 million, to $6.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2009 as fuel cell bus revenues in
the second quarter of 2009 were positively impacted by shipments for the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic
fuel cell bus program of $6.0 million.


Higher material handling revenues as a result of increased shipments to support Plug Power Inc.’s
GenDrive™ systems and consistent sales in the backup power market to IdaTech, LLC were offset by
lower fuel cell bus revenues and lower backup power revenues related to work performed on the
FirstEnergy distributed power generator project.


In the supporting Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments, second quarter of
2010 revenues increased 166%, or $5.7 million, to $9.1 million compared to the first quarter of
2009. Improvements in the Contract Automotive segment of $2.1 million were as a result of increased
shipments of light duty automotive products in support of Daimler AG’s Highway 2/3 programs.
Improvements in the Material Products segment of $3.6 million represents increased volumes of
carbon friction material products related to the recovery in the U.S. automotive sector in 2010 as
compared to 2009.


EBITDA1 for the second quarter of 2010 declined by $12.9 million, to ($9.3) million,
compared to $3.6 million, in the second quarter of 2009. EBITDA, excluding the impact related to
Ballard’s controlling ownership interest in Dantherm Power of ($1.0) million, declined $11.9
million to ($8.3) million.


EBITDA in the second quarter of 2009 was positively impacted by a non-cash gain of $10.8 million
related to Ballard’s decision to discontinue operations in EBARA Ballard Corporation (“EBARA
BALLARD”) on May 24, 2009. EBARA BALLARD was a joint venture with EBARA Corporation (“Ebara”) that
was focused on the development, manufacture, sale, and servicing of stationary power systems for
the residential cogeneration market in Japan. Excluding the impact of this 2009 non-cash gain and
excluding the impact of Dantherm Power in 2010, EBITDA declined by $1.1 million, to ($8.3) million
in the second quarter of 2010, compared to ($7.2) million in the second quarter of 2009. The $1.1
million decline was driven by lower investment and other income of $3.2 million and declines in
gross margins of $0.8 million which more than offset reductions in operating expenses of $2.7
million (excluding depreciation and amortization, and restructuring and related charges). The $2.7
million, or 21%, reduction in operating expenses was primarily a result of Ballard’s 2009 workforce
reduction and cost optimization initiatives which were partially offset by the negative effects in
2010 of a 14% stronger Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar.


Net income (loss) attributable to Ballard for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by $12.4
million, to ($10.9) million, or ($0.13) per share, compared with net income of $1.6 million, or
$0.02 per


share, in the second quarter of 2009. The second quarter net income in 2009 was positively impacted
by a non-cash gain of $10.8 million related to Ballard’s decision to discontinue operations in
EBARA BALLARD whereas net loss attributable to Ballard for the second quarter of 2010 includes the
negative impact of Ballard’s controlling interest in Dantherm Power of $1.0 million.


Cash used in operating activities in the second quarter of 2010 declined by $3.2 million to $12.1
million, compared to $15.3 million for the second quarter of 2009. Cash used in operating
activities, excluding the negative impact of Dantherm Power of $2.0 million, declined by $5.2
million to $10.1 million.


The lower cash used in operating activities of $5.2 million, excluding the results of Dantherm
Power, was primarily a result of reduced working capital requirements of $5.0 million as
improvements as a result of the timing of revenues and customer collections more than offset the
negative impact as a result of the continued buildup of inventory in 2010 to support expected
shipments in the last half of the year.


The cash used in operating activities of Dantherm Power of $2.0 million in the second quarter of
2010 was driven by delays in Danish government funding, the timing of revenue and customer
collections, and costs of development work on the new 5 kW direct hydrogen backup system. The
negative cash flow in Dantherm Power is expected to be markedly less in the last half of 2010.


Six months ended June 30, 2010


Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased 30%, or $6.3 million, to $27.4 million,
compared to $21.2 million for the corresponding period of 2009. Increases in the supporting
Material Products segment of $6.5 million combined with increases in the Contract Automotive
segment of $1.9 million, more than offset declines in the core Fuel Cell Products segment of $2.2
million.


In the core Fuel Cell Products business segment, first half of 2010 revenues declined 16%, or $2.2
million, to $11.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. Higher material handling revenues
as a result of increased shipments to support Plug Power Inc.’s GenDrive™ systems and increased
sales in the backup power market to IdaTech, LLC were offset by lower fuel cell bus revenues and
lower backup power revenues related to work performed on the FirstEnergy distributed power
generator project. Fuel cell bus revenues in the first half of 2009 were positively impacted by
shipments for the B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus program of $6.0 million. Revenues in the
second quarter of 2010 were positively impacted by the consolidation of Dantherm Power’s operating
results which contributed $1.1 million of revenue.


In the supporting Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments, first half of 2010
revenues increased 111%, or $8.4 million, to $16.0 million compared to the first half of 2009.
Improvements in the Contract Automotive segment of $1.9 million were as a result of increased
shipments of light duty automotive products in support of Daimler AG’s Highway 2/3 programs
partially offset by lower automotive testing and engineering services provided to AFCC.


Improvements in the Material Products segment of $6.5 million represents increased volumes of
carbon friction material products related to the recovery in the U.S. automotive sector in 2010 as
compared to 2009.


EBITDA1 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 declined by $4.0 million, to ($17.9)
million, compared to ($13.8) million, in the corresponding period of 2009. EBITDA, excluding the
impact related to Ballard’s controlling ownership interest in Dantherm Power of ($2.0) million,
declined $2.1 million to ($15.9) million.


EBITDA in the first half of 2009 was positively impacted by a net gain on discontinuance of
operations in EBARA BALLARD of $7.9 million. Excluding the impact of this 2009 non-cash gain and
excluding the impact of Dantherm Power in 2010, EBITDA improved by $5.9 million, or 27%, to ($15.9)
million in the first half of 2010, compared to ($21.8) million in the first half of 2009. The $5.9
million improvement was driven by lower operating expenses of $5.9 million (excluding depreciation
and amortization, and restructuring and related charges). Declines in investment and other income
of $1.7 million were offset by restructuring and related expenses in 2009 of $1.4 million relating
to the 7% workforce reduction initiated in March 2009. The $5.9 million, or 23%, reduction in
operating expenses was primarily a result of Ballard’s 2009 workforce reduction and cost
optimization initiatives which were partially offset by the negative effects in 2010 of a 17%
stronger Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar.


Net loss attributable to Ballard for the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased by $3.4 million,
to ($20.9) million, or ($0.25) per share, compared to ($17.5) million, or ($0.21) per share, in the
corresponding period of 2009.


Net loss in 2009 was positively impacted by a net non-cash gain of $7.9 million related to the
decision to discontinue operations in EBARA BALLARD whereas net loss attributable to Ballard in
2010 includes the negative impact of Ballard’s controlling interest in Dantherm Power of $2.1
million.


Cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased by $2.4 million
to $26.4 million, compared to $23.9 million for the corresponding period of 2009. Cash used in
operating activities, excluding the negative impact of Dantherm Power of $4.7 million, declined by
$2.3 million to $21.6 million.


The reduced cash used in operating activities in 2010 of $2.3 million, excluding the results of
Dantherm Power, was driven by lower cash operating losses of $6.4 million as a result of lower
operating expenses and higher gross margins, partially offset by increased working capital
requirements of $4.1 million primarily as a result of the continued buildup of inventory in 2010 to
support expected shipments in the last half of the year.


The cash used in operating activities of Dantherm Power of $4.7 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2010 was driven by delays in Danish government funding, the timing of revenue and customer
collections, and costs of development work on the new 5 kW direct hydrogen backup system.
