Exhibit 99.2

 

Chapter B of the Periodic Report

 

Directors' Report on the State of the Company's Affairs 

for nine-month and three-month periods ended 

September 30, 2010

 

We respectfully present the Directors' Report on the state of affairs of Bezeq – The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Limited ("the Company") and the consolidated Group companies (the Company and the consolidated companies together are hereinafter collectively referred to as "the Group”), for the nine- month period ended September 30, 2010 and the three-month period then ended ("Quarter").

 

The Directors’ Report includes a condensed review of the Company’s affairs, and it assumes that the Directors’ Report at December 31, 2009 is also available to the reader.

 

Commencing April 25, 2010, the financial statements of Walla! Communications Ltd. ("Walla") are consolidated in the financial statements of the Group (see Note 4B to the financial statements).

 

The Group has four main segments of operation in its financial statements:

 





  


1)


Domestic fixed-line communications




 





  


2)


Cellular




 





  


3)


International communications, internet and NEP services




 





  


4)


Multi-channel television




 

The Company has additional areas of operation which are not material to the Group's operations, and they are included in the financial statements as another business segment. These include the operation of a portal, content websites and online commercial websites (through Walla), and customer call center services.

 

Profit from continuing operations in the period amounted to NIS 1,868 million, compared with NIS 1,795 million in the corresponding period last year. Profit from continuing operations in the Quarter and in the corresponding quarter amounted to NIS 588 million. The results of the period and the Quarter were influenced mainly by an increase in revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in operating and general expenses, finance expenses and share in losses of equity accounted affiliates.

 

In the corresponding period and quarter, profit for the period included profit from an operation that was discontinued following termination of the consolidation of the financial statements of D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd. ("DBS"). As a result, profit for the corresponding period was NIS 3,174 million, compared with NIS 1,868 million in the reporting period, and in the corresponding quarter was NIS 2,063 million compared with NIS 588 million in the present Quarter.

 



  



  







  



 

A. Board of Directors explanations for the state of the Company's 

affairs, the results of its operations, its equity,

cash flows, and other matters

 





1.


Financial position




 






A.


The Group's assets at September 30, 2010 amounted to NIS 15.25 billion, compared to NIS 14.53 billion on September 30, 2009. Of these sums, NIS 5.53 billion (about 36%) are property, plant and equipment, compared to NIS 5.46 billion (about 38%) on September 30, 2009.





 

The increase in assets is due mainly to an increase in the assets of the Domestic fixed-line communications segment. Additional increase resulted from consolidation of the assets of Walla with those of the Group (see Note 4B to the financial statements). The increase was moderated by a decrease in the assets of the Cellular segment and of the International communications, internet and NEP services segment, as explained below.

 

In the Domestic fixed-line communications segment, there was an increase of NIS 706 million in total assets, excluding investment in associates, compared with the corresponding period. The increase stemmed mainly from an increase in cash balances and in the balance of property, plant and equipment.

 

In the Cellular segment, assets decreased from NIS 4.90 billion on September 30, 2009 to NIS 4.85 billion at September 30, 2010. The decrease stemmed mainly from a decrease in cash balances, financial assets held for sale, and in property, plant and equipment. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the trade receivables, mainly as a result of an increase in revenues from the sale of user equipment on installments.

 

In the International communications, internet and NEP services segment, total assets decreased from NIS 1,056 million on September 30, 2009 to NIS 999 million at September 30, 2010. Most of the decrease is in cash balances as a result of the distribution of dividends.  Investment in affiliates also decreased, due to the transfer of the holding in Walla. The decrease was partially offset by investments in capacity usage rights and in property, plant and equipment.

 

In the Multi-channel television segment, total assets increased from NIS 1,206 million on September 30, 2009 to NIS 1,260 million at September 30, 2010 mainly as a result of an increase in net investment balances in property, plant and equipment and in intangible assets.

 






B.


Group debt to financial institutions and debenture holders at September 30, 2010, amounted to NIS 5.73 billion, compared to NIS 4.17 billion on September 30, 2009. The increase is accounted for mainly in the Domestic fixed-line communications segment due to receipt of a bank loan (see Note 12B to the financial statements). The increase was moderated by repayment of debentures in the Domestic fixed-line communications segment and by repayment of debentures and loans in the Cellular segment.

Most of the increase in the Group's revenue is from the Cellular segment.

The increase was moderated by a decrease in revenues from the Domestic fixed-line communications segment.

 

Depreciation and amortization expenses of the Group in the reporting period amounted to NIS 1,041 million, compared with NIS 1,109 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of about 6.1%.

 

The Group's depreciation and amortization expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 350 million, compared with NIS 361 million in the corresponding quarter, a decrease of about 3%.

The increase in salary expense stemmed mainly from the "Other" segment, due to the first-time consolidation of Walla. Conversely, the increase was moderated in the reporting period by a decrease in the salary expense in the Domestic fixed-line communications segment.

 

Operating and general expenses of the Group in the reporting period amounted to NIS 3,713 million, compared with NIS 3,576 million in the corresponding period, an increase of about 3.8%.

 

Operating and general expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 1,271 million, compared with NIS 1,251 million in the corresponding quarter, an increase of about 1.6%.

 

The increase stemmed from a rise in the expenses of the Cellular and the International communications, internet and NEP services segments, and was moderated by a decrease in the expenses of the Domestic fixed-line communications segment.

 

The Group's Income from other operations, net, in the reporting period amounted to NIS 154 million, compared with NIS 54 million in the corresponding period.

The increase in net finance expenses is attributed mainly to the Domestic fixed-line communications segment and the Cellular segment.

 

The Group's share in the losses of equity accounted affiliates amounted to NIS 180 million in the reporting period compared with NIS 8 million in the corresponding period, and NIS 71 million in the Quarter, compared with a loss of NIS 12 million in the corresponding period.

 

Due to the termination of consolidation of the financial statements of DBS in the corresponding quarter, the Company's share in the losses of DBS in the amount of NIS 92 million, was classified under Discontinued operations. The balance of the increase was due to an increase in the Company's share in losses stemming from an increase in the losses of DBS in the period and the manner of their attribution among the various shareholders.

Domestic fixed-line communications segment

 

Revenue:

 

Revenue in the reporting period amounted to NIS 3,934 million, compared to NIS 3,987 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of about 1.3%.

 

Revenues in the Quarter amounted to NIS 1,323 million compared to NIS 1,343 million in the corresponding quarter, a decrease of about 1.5%.

 

The decrease in the segment's revenue is due mainly to a decrease in revenue from telephony as a result of a decrease in the number of lines and in call traffic. The decrease was moderated by an increase in revenue from high-speed internet, data communication and transmission. Revenues from interconnect fees to the cellular networks also decreased compared with the corresponding period, albeit with a corresponding decrease in expenses.

 

Costs and expenses:

 

Depreciation expenses in the reporting period amounted to NIS 512 million, compared with NIS 600 million in the corresponding period, a decrease on about 14.7%.

 

Depreciation expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 171 million, compared with NIS 184 million in the corresponding quarter, a decrease of about 7.1%.

The source of this decrease is the end of depreciation of property, plant and equipment and a change in the scrap value of property, plant and equipment.

 

Salary expenses in the reporting period amounted to NIS 783 million compared to NIS 797 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of about 1.8%.

 

Salary expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 256 million compared to NIS 255 million in the corresponding quarter, an increase of about 0.4%.

 

The decrease in salary expenses in the reporting period stemmed mainly from a rise in salary attributed to investment. The decrease in the salary expense due to reduction of the number of employees in the reporting period and in the Quarter, was offset by salary increases.

 

Operating and general expenses in the reporting period amounted to NIS 1,187 million compared to NIS 1,282 million in the corresponding period year, a decrease of about 7.4%.

 

Operating and general expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 399 million compared to NIS 451 million in the corresponding quarter, a decrease of about 11.5%.

 

The decrease stemmed from a decrease in operating expenses due to the implementation of efficiency measures, a decrease in interconnect expenses to the cellular operators alongside a decrease in interconnect revenue, and a decrease in royalty expenses as a result of a 0.5% decrease in royalty rates.

 

Other operating income, net, in the reporting period amounted to NIS 97 million, compared to NIS 54 million in the corresponding period.

 

Other operating income, net, in the Quarter amounted to NIS 59 million, compared to NIS 38 million in the corresponding quarter.

 

The increase in this income stemmed mainly from an increase in capital gains from the sale of assets and copper, which was moderated by an increase in the early retirement severance expense.

 

Operating income:

 

Operating income in the segment in the reporting period amounted to NIS 1,549 million, compared with NIS 1,362 million in the corresponding period, an increase of about 13.7%.

 

Operating income in the Quarter amounted to NIS 556 million compared to NIS 491 million in the corresponding quarter, an increase of about 13.2%.

 

The increase in operating income stems from the changes described above in the income and expenses section.

Conversely, linkage and interest expenses in respect of debentures have declined, due to a fall in the rate of rise in the CPI and a decrease in total liabilities.

Board of Directors remarks concerning market risks – exposure and management





 






A.


Further to the description in the Directors' Report for 2009, hedging transactions against market risks relating to exposure to changes in exchange rates and in the CPI, partially reduced this exposure.





 






B.


During 2010, the Company raised NIS 2.6 billion of debt by means of loans from Israeli banks, of which NIS 400 million was against early repayment of bank loans raised in March 2009, as described in Note 12B to the financial statements. As a result, the asset surplus exposed to changes in nominal shekel interest on December 31, 2009, decreased by NIS 1,324 million. In addition, during the reporting period the Company hedged copper prices in a net amount of 640 tons at a total net financial value of USD 5.1 million. Other than that, the sensitivity analyses for the fair value and effect of the change in the market prices on the fair value of on or off-balance-sheet balances for which there are firm agreements at September 30, 2010, do not differ substantially from the December 31, 2009 report.





 






C.


The linkage bases report at September 30, 2010 is not substantially different from the December 31, 2009 report, with the exception of the decrease in CPI-linked liabilities amounting to NIS 324 million, mainly due to repayment of NIS 759 of debentures. The decrease was moderated mainly by a rise in other current liabilities.

C.  Disclosure in connection with the Company's financial reporting

 






1.


Critical accounting estimates





 

Preparation of the financial statements according to international accounting standards (IFRSs) requires management to make assessments and estimates that influence the reported values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosure relating to contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and assessments on past experience and on valuations, opinions and other factors which it believes are relevant in the circumstances. Actual results can differ from these assessments on different assumptions and in different conditions. Information on the principal matters of uncertainty in critical assessments and judgments in the application of the accounting policy, is provided in the annual financial statements. We believe that these assessments and estimates are critical since any change in them and in the assump
tions behind them has the potential to materially affect the financial statements.








2.


In their letter to the shareholders to the Company, the auditors drew attention to the material amounts for which claims have been filed against the Group, which cannot yet be assessed or in respect of which the exposure cannot be calculated.
