    Mr. Jinxiang Lu, A-Power's Chairman and CEO
commented, “Our results in the second quarter were primarily driven by growth
in our DG business, both domestically and internationally.  This
segment experienced larger project orders and also benefitted from higher
international sales in the second quarter which fueled our gross margin
increase.  We are pleased that our revenue contribution from
international projects has exceeded 30% of total revenues for the first time
this quarter.  With significant wins in Vietnam, Pakistan and Thailand, we hope to continue building upon this international
success. While our DG business generated EPC work for wind projects, we did not recognize revenue from wind
turbine sales in the second quarter due to delays obtaining final permits for
our 2.7 MW turbines scheduled for delivery to our Inner Mongolia and Shandong wind projects. We believe wind turbine sales will pick up in the second half of the
year.”
    
    Second Quarter 2010 Financial
Results
    Revenues in the 2010 second quarter increased 30.1% to $74.8 million from $57.5 million in the second quarter of 2009. The increase was
primarily due to higher revenues recognized in the
Company’s core DG business, with 2.3% of the total revenue attributable to the sale of PV solar equipment.
Within the DG business segment, domestic sales represented approximately 67.4% of
total revenue while International DG sales represented 32.6% of total
DG revenue.
    
    Gross profit in the second quarter increased 51.1% to $11.6 million from $7.7 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 15.5%, up from 13.4% in the same quarter of 2009.
The improvement in gross
margin was attributable to
an increase in large-scale DG orders as well as higher international sales which
typically carry slightly higher margins.
    
    Selling, general and
administrative expenses
in the second quarter
were $8.7 million compared with $3.0 million in the prior year period. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses was mainly due to the growth of the businesses and
$2.7 million of SG&A expenses from
Evatech Co. Ltd.
("Evatech") which the Company acquired in January 2010. The Company continues to shift PV solar production for Evatech to its home base
in Shenyang.  As a percentage of revenues, selling,
general and administrative expenses increased to 11.7% for the second quarter of 2010 from 5.2% in the second quarter of 2009. 
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
          
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
     
    Operating income was $2.9 million, or 3.9% of revenue in the second quarter of 2010 compared with
$4.7 million, or 8.2% of revenue in the prior year period.
    
    GAAP net income attributable to A-Power in the 2010 second quarter increased 86.3% to $11.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, from $6.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Non-GAAP net income,
declined to $1.1 million from $4.7 million in prior year period.  In the 2010 second quarter, total shares
outstanding on a diluted
basis were 46.5 million shares, an increase of 32%, compared with 35.3 million in the prior year period.
     
    Please refer to the tables below for a
complete financial overview of our second quarter and first half results for 2010 and a reconciliation of
non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement to the most comparable
GAAP financial measures.
     
    Balance Sheet
    As of June 30, 2010, the Company had
cash and cash equivalents
and restricted cash
totaling $182.7 compared to $179.8 million at December 31, 2009.
 Prepayments, deposits, other receivables
from customers were $86.7 million compared with $52.5 million at
the end of 2009. Short-term loans outstanding, as of June 30, 2010, were $63.1 million, compared with $19.9 million at
December 31, 2009.  Working capital increased by
approximately $22.6 million in the 2010 second quarter to
$178.1 million. Total stockholders' equity
rose to $357.3 million at June 30, 2010 from
$252.6 million at December 31,
2009.
    
    Recent Developments
    Earlier in August, 2010, the Company
signed cooperative agreements with The United Steelworkers (USW) and
Shenyang Power Group (“SPG”). A-Power and SPG anticipate purchasing over time
approximately 50,000 tons
of steel from suppliers with employees represented by
the USW. The USW will also guide and work collaboratively on all
aspects of A-Power’s U.S. market strategies including
manufacturing, assembly, component sourcing, distribution and wind energy
project
development. The Company
expects that the cooperation with USW will benefit the
development of its projects
including the planning of a wind turbine assembly
plant in Nevada and the ongoing development of the
supply chain for the expected delivery of wind turbines to the 615MW wind farm
under development in Texas.
    
    In July 2010, the Company renewed its license agreement with
German wind technology company Fuhrlander AG (“Fuhrlander”), and obtained the right to manufacture, operate, service
and sell 2.7 MW wind turbines using
Furhlander’s F2500 technology throughout
China.  With the license agreement
with Fuhrlander, the Company expects to bolster its position in the market of
high capacity 2.7MW turbines, as the wind industry is increasingly
transitioning to higher
capacity turbines.
    
    Also in the month of July, the Company’s subsidiary, Shenyang (Ruixiang) Lucky
Wind Power Equipments Co., Ltd. (“Ruixiang”) has entered into a strategic
partnership with Baoding Huide Wind Power Engineering Co. Ltd (“Baoding Huide”), a renewable energy company primarily
focused on the development, manufacturing, and sales of 2.0 MW wind turbines and various
design parts of wind power
equipments in China. The
partnership is intended to
complement
A-Power’s wind business with Baoding Huide’s assembly facility of wind turbine equipment
to meet the growing demand
for wind power in China, the United States and elsewhere. 
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
          
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
     
    Effective June 30, 2010, the Company appointed Mr. Kam F. Cheung to the position of Vice President
of the International Division and Mr. Morris Li, Ph.D., to the position of
Vice President of Solar Research and Development. Mr. Cheung has more than 20 years of business development,
corporate finance, portfolio management, and securities underwriting
experience including within
the energy financing industry.  Doctor Li contributes to the Company’s proprietary PV cell
production business and has more than 13 years of semiconductor
industry experience.
    
    Business Outlook
    The Company reiterates its guidance for its full year 2010 outlook of revenues of
$500 million and
net income of $60
million.  This guidance is based upon the on-going DG projects and revenues from the expected sale of wind turbines to be generated during the remainder of
2010.
    
    Mr. Lu continued, “We have many compelling opportunities in
our business that can drive our revenue growth significantly higher in the
second half of the year. Our DG business is expected to remain
the primary performance driver with sales coming from our existing 15 projects. Significant sales are also
expected in our wind
turbine business in the second half of the year. We expect to begin delivery of 2.0 MW or larger turbines to customers in the second half of 2010. We are building a platform that will
establish A-Power as an
emerging leader in both distributed power and alternative power generation
systems and are working aggressively to capitalize on the long-term growth
opportunities in these areas.”
