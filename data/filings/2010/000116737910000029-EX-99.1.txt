      HUENENBERG, Switzerland – February
11, 2010 – Alcon, Inc. (NYSE:ACL) reported that global sales rose 14.5
percent to $1.72 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, or an 8.5 percent
increase excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Reported net
earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 grew 8.0 percent to $458 million, or
$1.51 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings would have grown 15.1
percent to $488 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, compared to net earnings
for the fourth quarter of 2008. Adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of
2009 exclude a $30 million tax provision related to a potential retroactive
change in tax law regarding the deductibility of foreign currency losses that
was not included in the company’s 2009 guidance.
      For the
full year 2009, Alcon, Inc. reported global sales of $6.50 billion, an increase
of 3.3 percent over 2008 global sales of $6.29 billion, or 6.3 percent excluding
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Net earnings for 2009 declined 2.0
percent to $2.01 billion, or $6.66 per share on a diluted
basis.  Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for 2009 would have risen 13.3
percent to $2.05 billion, or $6.81 per diluted share compared to adjusted net
earnings in 2008, which included the impact of a $236 million tax benefit.
Adjusted net earnings in 2009 exclude $19 million of pre-tax costs related to a
reduction in force and $30 million related to the aforementioned tax
provision.
      Reconciliations
of reported and adjusted results for the quarter and full year are included in
the financial tables below.
      “Our
results in the fourth quarter clearly show improving dynamics in the eye care
market and positive momentum in Alcon’s key brands that supported solid organic
sales growth in the quarter,” said Kevin Buehler, Alcon’s president and chief
executive officer.  “We built momentum throughout the year to deliver
on the Alcon business model of sustainable organic growth, global market share
gains and core margin improvement. While selected market challenges remain,
these encouraging trends and the long-term strategic drivers of our business
position Alcon well to deliver sustainable growth.”
      
      Buehler
added, “In response to an unprecedented economic environment, we took management
actions early in the year to align spending to strategic
priorities.  These actions allowed us to achieve solid financial
results while bolstering our commercial presence in emerging markets like China
and India and enhancing our research capabilities through the ESBATech and
AstraZeneca transactions.”

                International
      organic sales growth was 7.3 percent (+18.0 percent reported), driven by
      an 11.5 percent organic rise (+19.3 percent reported) in emerging

      Earnings
Highlights
      Summarized
below are earnings highlights for the fourth quarter of 2009. All growth
comparisons are for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of
2008.

                Gross
      profit margin was consistent with management expectations at 74.0 percent,
      compared to 79.2 percent in 2008. The year-over-year change was primarily
      attributable to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and increased
      royalty expense in 2009.

                Selling,
      general and administrative expenses increased to $521 million, or 30.4
      percent of sales.  The 16.0 percent rise in fourth quarter 2009
      expense is partially attributable to an increase in legal reserves and
      prior year comparison which included an insurance recovery and a reduction
      in expense associated with deferred compensation
  programs.

                Research
      and development expenses rose 29.1 percent to $204 million to represent
      11.9 percent of sales as the company continued to invest in research to
      enhance its capabilities and pipeline. This increase reflects the
      licensing payment to Potentia. Pharmaceuticals, the addition of a full
      quarter of ESBATech expenditures and higher internal project
      spending.

                Strong
      sales growth contributed to operating profit of $537 million, or 31.3
      percent of sales, compared to $573 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
      This decline was mainly the result of the fluctuating currency impact on
      gross margin in each quarter and timing differences in research and
      development expense.

                Other
      income/expense changed from an expense of $82 million in 2008 to income of
      $13 million in 2009, mainly due to losses on the company’s investment
      portfolio in 2008 compared to gains in
2009.

                The
      company’s effective tax rate was 17.3 percent, primarily due to the impact
      of the $30 million tax provision noted
  previously.

                Net
      earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 rose 8.0 percent to $458 million,
      or $1.51 per diluted share. Excluding the $30 million period charge to tax
      expense in the fourth quarter 2009, adjusted net earnings would have grown
      15.1 percent to $488 million, or $1.61 per diluted
  share.

      purchase the remaining shares in Alcon, Inc. held by Nestle S.A. pursuant
      to the agreement executed on April 7, 2008. Concurrent to the option
      exercise, Novartis submitted to the Alcon board of directors a proposal
      for a merger of Alcon with Novartis to be effected under Swiss merger
      law.  Under the terms of the merger proposal, holders of the
      approximately 23 percent of Alcon shares that are publicly traded would
      receive 2.8 Novartis shares for each Alcon share.  The proposed
      merger is contingent upon, among other things, approval by the Alcon board
      of directors, the closing of the purchase and sale transaction related to
      the Novartis option exercise as well as receipt of required regulatory
      approvals.

      January 20, 2010, the Independent Director Committee of the Alcon board of
      directors, with the assistance of independent financial and legal counsel,
      issued their formal response to the Novartis merger
      proposal.  This committee rejected the merger proposal based on
      its assessment that the price offered and other terms were not
      acceptable.

                Alcon’s
      board of directors voted to propose to shareholders a dividend of 3.95
      Swiss francs per share.  At exchange rates in effect on February
      10, 2010 this equalled approximately $3.69 per share, compared to $3.64 in
      2009.  The proposed amount reflects an increase in the targeted
      dividend payout ratio from 50 percent in 2009 to 55 percent in
      2010.  The proposal will be voted on at the company’s Annual
      General Meeting of shareholders to be held on May 20, 2010.  The
      U.S. dollar equivalent received by shareholders will be based on the Swiss
      Franc/U.S. dollar exchange rate in effect on the date of payment, which
      currently is scheduled for June 7,
2010.
              
            
      
       
      Financial
Guidance
      The
company expects full year 2010 organic sales growth to return to the
mid-to-high single digits and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share to be
between $7.30 and $7.55.  The full year guidance assumes renewal of
the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit in the second half of 2010 with
retroactive application. This guidance also excludes any costs and/or reductions
in sales associated with potential health care reform initiatives in the United
States, as well as costs related to a potential change in control to and/or
merger with Novartis.

      Note:
Organic change calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations and acquisitions. Management believes organic sales change is an
important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with
a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit
volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a
non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year
presentation.

      Note:
Organic change calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations and acquisitions. Management believes organic sales change is an
important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with
a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit
volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a
non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year
presentation.

Adjusted net earnings and diluted EPS measure the results of the company's
operations without certain items that pertained only to the period presented.
Management believes these measures are an important measure of the company’s
operations because it provides investors with a clearer picture of the core
operations of the company.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities

Organic change presents sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations and acquisitions. Management believes organic sales change is an
important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with
a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit
volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a
non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S.
