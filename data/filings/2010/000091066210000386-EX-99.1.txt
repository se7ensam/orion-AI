    Bezeq -
The Israel Telecommunication Corp., Ltd. (TASE: BEZQ), announced today that on
September 7, 2010, the Company received notice from its subsidiary, Pelephone
Communications Ltd. (“Pelephone”) that on September 6, 2010 a
judgment was entered against Pelephone requiring it to pay the State of Israel
royalties on its revenues for a limited period in the 1990s. The judgment

Pelephone’s revenues.
    
    The court

1, 1994 and October 10, 1994, and accepted the State of Israel’s claim with
respect to the period between October 11, 1994 and February 7,
1996.
    
    The
precise amount that Pelephone will be required to pay the State of Israel has
not been determined, and the parties must complete a procedure to determine such
amount within the period of time specified in the judgment.
