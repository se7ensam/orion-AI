Operating Review




Second Quarter




Territory 1:

Acergy Northern Europe and Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $121.1 million (Q2 2009: $130.6 million) reflecting the ongoing challenging market environment and fewer projects in installation phase, partly offset by good operational progress on a number of projects including the DSVi frame agreement, DONG Trym, BP Skarv and Deep Panuke.  Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $5.0 million (Q2 2009: net operating loss of $4.5 million) reflecting lower activity levels due to prevailing market conditions, lower vessel utilisation and the rescheduling of certain vessels for upcoming offshore operations. These factors were partially offset by the recognition of variation orders. Commercia
l negotiations on the Marathon Volund Project continue.




Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $81.3 million (Q2 2009: $53.7 million) reflecting good progress on the Pluto Project. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $41.3 million (Q2 2009: $14.9 million) reflecting the successful completion of offshore operations on the Pluto and Pyrenees Projects, partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations.




Territory 2:

Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $316.1 million (Q2 2009: $207.9 million) reflecting continued good operational progress on a number of major projects: Angola LNG, EPC4A, Block 15 and PazFlor, and a good contribution from Sonamet, which remained fully consolidated during the quarter although is classified as an asset held for sale.  Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $83.1 million (Q2 2009: $41.1 million) due to good operational performance across the project portfolio, including Block 15, EPC4A, Angola LNG, PazFlor and Sonamet.




Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.4 million (Q2 2009: $29.2 million). Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $5.2 million (Q2 2009: net operating income of $8.1 million) as a result of the segment’s operating cost base which was not covered by project activity.




Acergy South America - Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $60.3 million (Q2 2009: $100.7 million) reflecting lower activity levels due to the completion of the Frade SURF Project. This was partly offset by the four ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras, which achieved full utilisation during the quarter outside of planned dry-dock and the contribution from the Roncador Manifold Project. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $3.5 million (Q2 2009: $10.3 million) reflecting lower activity levels partly offset by strong performance from Acergy Condor, Pertinacia and Polar Queen.




Acergy Corporate:

Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $1.7 million (Q2 2009: $3.4 million).  Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $24.0 million (Q2 2009: net operating income of $11.1 million) primarily due to the lower utilisation of corporate vessels, including Acergy Eagle and Acergy Falcon and reflects the transfer of the Polar Queen from the Acergy Corporate segment to Acergy South America. Professional fees arising from the proposed combination, foreign exchange losses and ongoing legal restructuring and organisational optimisation were partially offset by positive contributions from the SHL and NKT Flexibles joint 
ventures.




Discontinued operations

Net income from discontinued operations for the second quarter was $4.5 million (Q2 2009: $0.9 million) due to the positive contribution from the Mexilhao Trunkline Project.




Asset Development




The Sonamet joint venture remained fully consolidated as at May 31, 2010 although it continues to be classified as ‘Assets held for sale’.  After the completion of the sale and transfer of shares the business will be deconsolidated from Acergy’s financials and its future results will be reported as share of results of associates and joint ventures.

As part of the ongoing fleet development programme, Acergy has acquired two vessels, post quarter end. Firstly, the acquisition of Antares, a new shallow water barge for the Conventional market for pipelay and hook-up projects in West Africa.  Secondly, the acquisition of Polar Queen, a flexible pipelay and subsea construction ship which joined the fleet in 2006 on long-term charter, and which is currently on a long-term service agreement with Petrobras in Brazil.




Toisa Proteus was returned to her owner following the successful completion of offshore operations on the Pluto Project.




Financial Review




Second Quarter




Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $581 million (Q2 2009: $526 million) primarily reflecting good activity levels in West Africa and Asia Pacific, which were partially offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea, Brazil and Gulf of Mexico.




Gross profit was $163 million (Q2 2009: $128 million) due to higher activity levels and a strong operating performance driven by good project execution, particularly in West Africa and Asia Pacific.




Administrative expenses were $74 million (Q2 2009: $55 million) due to the effect of foreign currency translation, higher professional fees arising from the proposed combination with Subsea 7 Inc., ongoing legal restructuring and organisational optimisation and higher tendering costs.




Acergy’s share of results of associates and joint ventures was $4 million (Q2 2009: $9 million) reflecting a positive consolidated contribution from NKT Flexibles, Seaway Heavy Lifting and SapuraAcergy.




The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the three months was 20.9% (Q2 2009: 21.5%).  The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 21.9% (Q2 2009: 21.1%).




Other gains and losses was a gain of $5 million (Q2 2009: $8 million) primarily reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation on short-term Euro inter-company and cash balances and realised hedging losses arising from the weakened Euro in the quarter.




Income before taxes from continuing operations for the second quarter was $95 million (Q2 2009: $85 million) primarily reflecting a strong operational performance across the project portfolio. This was partly offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea, Brazil and Gulf of Mexico, lower vessel utilisation, and higher administrative expenses.




Taxation for the quarter was $32 million (Q2 2009: $9 million) resulting in an effective tax rate for the quarter of 34% (Q2 2009: 11%) reflecting the current geographical portfolio mix of our business. The effective tax rate for Q2 2009 reflects the release of certain provisions following the resolution of a number of audits during that quarter.




Income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $63 million (Q2 2009: $76 million).  Net income from total operations for the second quarter was $67 million (Q2 2009: $77 million).




The cash and cash equivalents position at the quarter end was $631 million (February 28 2010: $667 million) reflecting working capital outflows and the capital expenditure on Acergy Borealis, which will be funded entirely from the Company’s existing cash resources.  Deferred revenue at the quarter end stood at $227 million (February 28, 2010: $232 million).




At May 31, 2010, Acergy S.A. held directly 10,537,524 treasury shares representing 5.41% of the total number of issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares, of which 573,000 are held in an employee benefit trust to support the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  Total shares in issue were 194,953,972, including treasury shares.

Backlog




Backlog for continuing operations as at May 31, 2010 was approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $0.9 billion is expected to be executed in the fiscal year 2010. This figure does not include backlog related to associates and joint ventures.

(2) Pre-backlog reflects the stated value of letters of intent and the expected value of escalations on frame agreements




 

Trading Outlook




The more stable oil price and strong tendering continues to underpin confidence in our business. However, for shorter-term work, particularly in the North Sea, the pricing environment remains competitive, and is likely to continue to impact margins in 2011.




Activity in the Conventional market in West Africa is expected to remain strong in the short and medium-term.  A number of the major SURF contracts, delayed during 2009, are still expected to come to market award in the second half of 2010. The offshore installation phase of these new SURF projects will commence beyond 2011.




We believe the trend will be for SURF projects to continue to increase in size and complexity which will contribute to substantial industry growth in the medium-term.  We are well placed to combine our competitive strengths of high calibre engineering and project management skills with our high quality assets to capture these growth opportunities.

(a)  Adjusted EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by rev
enue from continuing operations.  Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the European Union.  These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as they eliminate the effects of financing and depreciation.  Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measur
es reported by other companies.  Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity.  The reconciliation of the Group’s net inc
ome from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this release.  This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and equipment and intangibles.  Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry.  Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above.  Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.

 

Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements may be identified by the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the approximate va
lue of the contract award, expectations as to the Group’s performance in 2010, the continued commercial negotiations relating to the Marathon Volund Project, the impact of the sale and deconsolidation of the Sonamet joint venture, the funding of Acergy Borealis, expectations regarding our backlog and pre-backlog, statements contained in the "Trading Outlook" section, including our visibility for 2010 and 2011, the expected impact of a continued competitive pricing environment, the anticipated activity levels in the Conventional market in West Africa, the anticipation that delayed major SURF contracts will come to market and the timing of the offshore installation phase of such projects, the expectation for SURF contracts to increase in size and complexity in the medium-term and our ability to capture growth opportunities. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our publi
c filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: actions by regulatory authorities or other third parties; unanticipated costs and difficulties related to the integration of Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7 Inc. and our ability to achieve benefits therefrom; unanticipated delays, costs and difficulties related to the combination transaction, including satisfaction of closing conditions; our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, includ
ing spills and environmental damage.  Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

 

This communication does not constitute an offer to purchase, sell, or exchange or the solicitation of an offer to sell, purchase, or exchange any securities of Subsea 7 or Acergy.

Interim Management Report: Financial Review




First Half




Revenue from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2010 was $1,157 million (H1 2009: $1,029 million) primarily reflecting good activity levels in West Africa and Asia Pacific, which were partially offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea, Brazil and Gulf of Mexico.




Gross profit was $310 million (H1 2009: $242 million) due to higher activity levels and a strong operating performance driven by good project execution, particularly in West Africa and Asia Pacific.




Administrative expenses were $138 million (H1 2009: $109 million). This increase was due to higher professional fees, including ongoing legal restructuring and organisational optimisation and those arising from the proposed combination with Subsea 7 Inc., higher tendering costs and the effect of foreign currency translation.




Acergy’s share of net income of associates and joint ventures was $22 million (H1 2009: $18 million). The improved results were primarily due to an increased Seaway Heavy Lifting contribution, partially offset by a reduced NKT Flexibles contribution reflecting ongoing challenging conditions in the flexible pipelay market and a lower SapuraAcergy contribution reflecting strong operational performance offset by foreign exchange fluctuations.




The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations in the first half of fiscal year 2010 was 22.2% (H1 2009: 20.9%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the first half of fiscal year 2010 was 22.6% (H1 2009: 20.5%).




Other gains and losses from continuing operations were a loss of $15 million (H1 2009: gain of $6 million), primarily reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation on short-term Euro inter-company and cash balances and realised hedging losses arising from the weakened Euro in the first half of fiscal year 2010.




Income before taxes from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2010 was $171 million (H1 2009: $147 million), primarily reflecting strong operational performance, particularly in Acergy AFMED and Acergy AME and an improved contribution from associates and joint ventures. This was partly offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea, Brazil and Gulf of Mexico, higher administrative expenses and other losses arising from foreign exchange movements.




Taxation for first half of fiscal year 2010 was $55 million (H1 2009: $32 million) resulting in an effective tax rate of 32% (H1 2009: 22%), reflecting the current geographical portfolio mix of Acergy’s business. The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal year 2009 reflects the release of certain provisions following the resolution of a number of audits during that period.




Income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2010 was $115 million (H1 2009: $115 million). Income from total operations for the first half of fiscal year 2010 was $125 million (H1 2009: $118 million).




The cash and cash equivalents position at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2010 was $631 million (November 30, 2009: $908 million) reflecting working capital outflows and the capital expenditure on Acergy Borealis, which will be funded entirely from the Company’s existing cash resources.  Deferred revenue at the  end of the first half of fiscal year 2010 stood at $227 million (November 30, 2009: $280 million).

Risks and uncertainties




The principal risks and uncertainties which could impact the Group for the remainder of the current financial year are those detailed on pages 42 to 45 and the factors affecting the business results on 71 to 73 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements for November 30, 2009. The Directors have considered the principal risks and uncertainties and believe that these have not changed significantly in the interim period. These include, amongst others: business environment, seasonality, ship utilisation and scheduling, maintenance and reliability of assets, revision of estimates on major projects, currency exchange fluctuations and impairment charges.




In particular, the significant risks faced by the Company over the remaining half of the year relate to project execution, especially with regards to EPC4A, ALNG, Block 17/18 and Deep Panuke, all of which will be in offshore phases.




Responsibility statement




We confirm that to the best of our knowledge, that the consolidated financial information for the period December 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” and gives a true and fair view of the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit as a whole.  We also confirm, to the best of our knowledge, that this report includes a fair review of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the consolidated financial information and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year.

ACERGY S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES




NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





1.  Basis of preparation


The consolidated financial statements for the period December 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 ‘ Interim Financial Reporting’ as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2009 which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as adopted by the European Union.




2. Accounting policies




The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.




The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with the annual financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2009, as described in those annual financial statements. In addition the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been adopted from December 1, 2009:




The Group has adopted the following new International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations as of December 1, 2009.




IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (revised)




The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity. The statement of changes in equity includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented in the new statement of comprehensive income. The Group has elected to present a separate statement of comprehensive income.




IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised 2008) and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial

Statements (revised 2008)




IFRS 3 (revised 2008) introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date. Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interests (previously “minority interests”), the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages. These changes will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period when an acquisition occurs and future reported results. IAS 27 (revised 2008) requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary (without a change in control) is to be accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners. Therefore such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, nor will they give rise to a gain or lo
ss in the statement of comprehensive income. Furthermore the revised standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by a partially owned subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary. The changes in IFRS 3 (revised 2008) and IAS 27 (revised 2008) will affect future acquisitions, changes in, and loss of control of, subsidiaries and transactions with non-controlling interests.




The change in accounting policy was applied prospectively and has not materially impacted the group this quarter.




The adoption of the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretation had no impact on the reported income or net assets of the Group in the quarter.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty




In the application of the Group’s accounting polices which are described in the annual financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2009, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.




The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.




The Board of Directors make accounting judgements on the following aspects of the business as described in full in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2009:





§  


Revenue recognition on long-term contracts








§  


Revenue recognition on variation orders and claims








§  


Property, plant and equipment








§  


Impairment of investments in and advances to associates and joint ventures








§  


Recognition of provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities








§  


Taxation








§  


Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments










5. Seasonality




Seasonality in Acergy’s results is discussed on page 71 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2009.  Nothing significant has happened during the period which would have a material impact on the seasonality of Acergy’s results.

ACERGY S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES




NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




6. Dividends




The Directors proposed a dividend of $0.23 per share at the end of the 2009 fiscal year.  The dividend was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in May 2010, and was paid in June 2010.  The total dividend paid was $42.2 million.




A dividend of $0.22 per share was paid in 2009 in association with the 2008 fiscal year with a total cost of $40.2 million and a dividend of $0.21 per share was paid in 2008 in association with the 2007 fiscal year with a total cost of $38.3m.




There has been no interim dividend recommended by the Board of Directors.




7. Contingent liabilities




During 2009 Acergy’s Brazilian business was audited and formally assessed for ICMS tax (import duty) by the Brazilian tax authorities (Secretaria Fazenda Estado Rio de Janeiro).  The amount assessed, including penalties and interest amounted to $61.7 million as at November 30, 2009.  Acergy has challenged this assessment and will revert to the courts if necessary.  No provision has been made for any payment as the Group does not believe that this liability is probable.




In the course of business, the Group becomes involved in contract disputes from time-to-time due to the nature of our activities as a contracting business involved in several long-term projects at any given time.  The Group makes provisions to cover the expected risk of loss to the extent that negative outcomes are probable and reliable estimates can be made.  However, the final outcomes of these contract disputes are subject to uncertainties as to whether or not they develop into a formal legal action and therefore the resulting liabilities may exceed the liability it anticipates.




Furthermore, the Group is involved in legal proceedings from time to time incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of any litigation could require the Group to make additional expenditures in excess of reserves that the Group may establish.  In the ordinary course of business, various claims, suits and complaints have been filed against the Group in addition to the ones specifically referred to above.  Although the final resolution of any such other matters could have a material effect on operating results for a particular reporting period, the Group believes that they should not materially affect its consolidated financial pos
ition.
