     ALBERTA STAR SUCCESSFUL AT THE SASKATCHEWAN CROWN LAND SALE AND CONTINUES WITH PHASE- 2 DRILLING AT LANDROSE, SASKATCHEWAN

      
VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - Alberta Star Development Corp. (TSXV: ASX) (“Alberta Star” or the “Company”) announces that the Company was successful at the December 6, 2010, Saskatchewan Crown Land Sale, acquiring petroleum and natural gas rights on a 160 acre parcel of undeveloped lands in the Lloydminster heavy oil region. The acquisition increases the Company’s growing land base in west central Alberta and Saskatchewan and increases the additional potential for multiple drilling opportunities being identified, finalized and planned by Alberta Star and its industry partner for drilling exploration in 2011. Alberta Star holds an undivided 50% working interest in the acquired lands, as the acquisition was made jointly on a 50/50 basis with an industry partner.
The Company holds a 50% working interest in three (3) in-fill wells now being drilled and currently underway with Phase-2 at Landrose, Saskatchewan. The Company’s Phase 2 Drilling program which is underway, is scheduled to consist of three wells, one of which has been drilled and cased and expected to be completed and in production in the coming week, is proceeding on schedule and is expected to meet the Company’s scheduled 2010 exploration drilling targets and allow the Company to exit the year, by increasing and meeting its daily aggregate production growth targets.
