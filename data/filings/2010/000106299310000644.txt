<P align=justify><B>March 4, 2010 -- Alexco Resource Corp. (TSX:AXR,
NYSE-AMEX:AXU) (&#147;Alexco&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;)</B> is pleased to announce the 2010
plans for the largest exploration program the Company has ever undertaken in the
Keno Hill Silver District, Yukon Territory. Approximately 30,000 meters of
diamond drilling is planned in 2010, comprising 25,000 meters of surface
drilling throughout the district plus an additional 5,000 meters of underground
drilling specifically at the Bellekeno mine which is currently under
construction. The aim of the expanded exploration program is to define new and
additional high grade minable resources at a number of sites within the
district, including the Bellekeno mine and the historical Silver King mine, as
well as the historical Lucky Queen mine where drilling in 2009 identified a new
high grade zone of mineralization down-plunge of the historical Lucky Queen
workings. Alexco plans to invest a minimum of $12 million to complete this 2010
exploration program. </P>
<P align=justify><B>2010 Keno Hill Exploration Highlights </B></P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>An approximately 25,000 meter surface drill program, scheduled to begin
  this month, is planned for the Keno Hill Silver District, where the Company&#146;s
  land holdings exceed 23,000 hectares. This work will be in addition to the
  approximately 5,000 meter Bellekeno underground exploration and definition
  drilling program initiated in February, 2010. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Surface exploration work will focus at the Silver King, Lucky Queen, Onek
  and Bermingham- Ruby-Hector Calumet mine areas, among others, with the aim of
  defining additional minable silver resources at grades comparable to the
  historical Keno Hill district production grades of approximately 40 ounces
  silver per ton. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>In addition to the systematic exploration and definition of new silver
  deposits outlined above, the Company will expand and accelerate its recently
  initiated (during 2009) &#147;blind target&#148; exploration program, which is designed
  to test targets where extrapolated stratigraphic, structural and geochemical
  patterns are similar to those associated with the larger and higher grade
  historical silver deposits in the district. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Underground definition and exploration drilling continues at the Bellekeno
  mine, where an indicated resource of 401,000 tonnes grading 921 grams silver,
  9.4% lead and 6.5% zinc was outlined in 2009 (see news release dated November
  11, 2009 entitled &#147;Alexco Completes Positive Bellekeno Mine Development Plan,
  Silver Wheaton Concurs <B>&#150; </B>Initiation of Construction Approved&#148;). The
  Bellekeno resource, which is currently being developed for mining production
  in 2010, comprises three mineralized zones: East, 99 and Southwest. The
  majority of the 2010 Bellekeno exploration drilling will
focus on testing open, southwest-plunging areas of mineralization primarily in
the East and Southwest zones. </P></LI></UL>

<P align=justify><B>2010 Keno Hill Exploration Program </B></P>
<P align=justify>The 2010 Keno Hill exploration program is designed to define
and expand silver mineralization and resources at Bellekeno, to confirm and
expand historical resources at Silver King and Lucky Queen, and to test other
priority targets throughout the district. At the Bellekeno mine, which is on
track to commence production in the third quarter of calendar 2010, extensions
to existing zones of mineralization will be tested in six areas. </P>
<P align=justify>In the vicinity of the historical Silver King mine, drilling in
2009 on the Silver King #5 vein intersected 2.55 meters grading 1,932 grams per
tonne silver (56.4 ounces per ton), 11.3% lead and 0.4% zinc (see news release
dated December 1, 2009 entitled &#147;Alexco Announces Additional 2009 Drill Results,
Keno Hill District, Yukon: Silver King Drilling Intersects 2.55 Meters of 56.4
Ounces per Ton Silver&#148;) in quartzite-rich rocks located stratigraphically below
schist-rich rocks that host the majority of the historically reported Silver
King resources. In the Keno Hill district, the bulk of the past producing ore
bodies occur within quartzite-rich sections, thereby adding to the potential for
expansion of the Silver King historic resource at depth. </P>
<P align=justify>Similarly, at the historical Lucky Queen mine, Alexco&#146;s
discovery in 2009 of a new zone of mineralization approximately 70 meters
down-plunge from the historical workings was highlighted by a number of
significant intercepts, including K09-209 which returned assays to 2,120 grams
per tonne silver (61.8 ounces per ton), 5.0% lead and 9.7% zinc over 4.23 meters
(see news release dated November 3, 2009 entitled &#147;Alexco Announces Additional
2009 Drill Results from Lucky Queen, Keno Hill District: Drilling Intersects
4.23 meters of 61.8 Ounces per Ton Silver&#148;). Drilling in 2010 is targeted to
define and expand this new zone of Lucky Queen mineralization. Assuming success,
the Company aims to produce new resource estimates for Silver King and Lucky
Queen, as well as an updated resource estimate for Bellekeno, during 2010. </P>
<P align=justify>In the shorter term, and unrelated to the 2010 exploration
program, the Company plans to release a resource estimate for the historical
tailings in the Keno Hill Silver District, based on approximately 280 sonic
drill holes drilled in 2009. </P>
<P align=justify>From June 2006 through calendar 2009, Alexco has drilled 157
diamond drill holes totaling approximately 35,600 meters in the Keno Hill Silver
District. A further 201 holes and 25,900 meters have been drilled from surface
and underground in the Bellekeno mine area. The Company has also flown 2,016
line-kilometers of airborne geophysics, and has compiled approximately 35,000
documents and digital data into a 300 gigabyte digital library/database. </P>
<P align=justify>To date, only 16 of the approximately 35 known historical mine
areas occurring within Alexco&#146;s Keno Hill district land holdings have been drill
tested by Alexco. In addition to silver, and largely apart from historical
mines, the Company has identified areas of gold mineralization requiring
additional work. </P>

<P align=justify>This news release has been reviewed and verified by Stan Dodd,
Vice President, Exploration for Alexco and a Qualified Person as defined by
National Instrument 43-101. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Keno Hill Silver District History </B></P>
<P align=justify>Between 1921 and 1988, the Keno Hill Silver District produced
more than 217 million ounces of silver with average grades of 40.5 ounces per
ton silver, 5.6% lead and 3.1% zinc (Yukon Government's Minfile database). The
historical production grades would rank Keno Hill in the top 3% by grade of
today's global silver producers. The Keno Hill district is the second-largest
historical silver producer in Canada. </P>
<P align=justify><B>About Alexco </B></P>

closed or abandoned mine sites through integration and implementation of the
Company&#146;s core competencies which include management of environmental services,
