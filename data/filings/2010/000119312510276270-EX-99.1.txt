PRESS RELEASE
  
DECEMBER 7, 2010
  




    
AEGON to detail progress in execution of strategy at investor conference 
 


•
 
 Sharpened focus on core activities and capturing efficiencies in US 
 


•
 
 Integration of Asian businesses under leadership of new CEO AEGON Asia, Douglas Henck 
AEGON CEO Alex Wynaendts will today outline the actions being taken in the United States and Asia to sharpen its focus and capture additional operational
and cost efficiencies to strengthen the company’s position in its core businesses: life insurance, pensions and asset management. Mr. Wynaendts and other senior management are hosting AEGON’s annual Analyst & Investor
Conference today and tomorrow in New York City.  A main focus of the conference will be the actions underway in the US to increase market
share in the Life and Protection segment; implement a business shift to more fee-based products in the Individual Savings and Retirement markets; and pursue the growth opportunities in the Employee Solutions and Pensions segments. Mark Mullin, a
member of the Management Board and CEO of AEGON Americas, will also cover recent actions to wind-down the company’s activities in the executive non-qualified benefit plan and related Bank-Owned and Corporate-Owned Life Insurance markets in the
United States, as well as consolidate operations to improve efficiencies across the organization.  AEGON also announces a new organizational
structure for its operations in Asia under the leadership of a newly-established CEO position for Asia. Douglas Henck, who has held a number of senior management positions in the insurance sector over the past twenty-five years, mostly in Asia, has
been appointed as AEGON’s CEO of AEGON Asia. Whereas a number of AEGON’s businesses in Asia have been managed from the US, under the new structure all Asian based insurance businesses will be managed as one regional division headquartered
in Hong Kong. The aim is to leverage product and distribution expertise, capture efficiencies, and pursue organic growth of AEGON’s franchise in Asia. The integration, which will be carried out during 2011, is in line with AEGON’s strategy
to achieve a greater geographical balance in favor of those regions and markets that offer higher growth and returns in the longer-term. 
“We are making solid progress towards our ambition of securing a leadership position for AEGON in all of our chosen markets in the coming five
years,” said CEO Alex Wynaendts. “The steps we are taking are aimed at sharpening our focus on the clear opportunities for our core business, implementing significant cost efficiencies in the United States, Europe and in Asia for the
benefit of our customers, business partners and shareholders. This is a unique time for our business given the trends in almost every market which make clear the increasing need for individuals to take responsibility for their long-term financial
security. We are determined to make the most of the significant opportunities from a position of strength, operational excellence and recognized expertise.”  The company will provide further details later today during AEGON’s Analyst & Investor Conference in New York City, webcast live at 5 pm EST and accessible at www.aegon.com.
