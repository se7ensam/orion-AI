Midroog Ltd., an Israeli rating company affiliated with Moody’s, has awarded the Company’s new
debentures an A2 stable rating. The rating was secured in advance of BCOM’s intended issuance of up to
NIS 400 million of six-seven year debentures.

In awarding the new debentures an A2 stable rating, Midroog cited the following factors: (1) the
Company’s holding of the controlling interest in Bezeq, the leading player in the Israeli communications
market, which has an Aa1 stable rating; (2) the leverage inherent in BCOM’s ownership of the controlling
interest in Bezeq; and (3) the financing structure for the acquisition of the Bezeq interest, including the
seniority of BCOM’s debt and its ability to repay the financing secured to facilitate the Bezeq acquisition.

Midroog also based its assessment on the low level of business risk inherent in Israel’s communications
market, including (1) Bezeq’s position in Israel’s communications market as the leading provider of
diverse communications services to the Israeli market; and (2) the strength of the Bezeq brand, which is
supported by leading technology and high-quality services and management. The Aa1 stable rating
awarded to Bezeq’s debentures is based, in part, on its own leverage levels, which enable it to cover its
debt quickly.

In addition, Midroog gave consideration to forecasts regarding BCOM’s cash flow, collateral, debt
seniority, leverage levels and debt coverage capabilities. These considerations led Midroog to award
BCOM’s new debentures a different rating than it awarded Bezeq, BCOM’s underlying asset.

B Communications Receives A2 Stable Rating;
Company Prepares to Issue New Debentures Totaling NIS 400M
