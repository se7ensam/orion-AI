AEGON to sharpen focus on core activities in US and capture efficiencies 
 


•
 
 Decision to wind-down BOLI/COLI business   


•
 
 Consolidation of Louisville operations with other existing US locations 
Consistent with its strategic focus on its core business – life insurance, pensions and asset management - AEGON will discontinue new sales of
executive non-qualified benefit plans and related Bank-Owned and Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI/COLI) business in the United States. The majority of the operations of this business are located in Dallas, Texas. 
In addition, AEGON will pursue further operational and cost efficiencies by consolidating its operations currently based in Louisville, Kentucky with
other existing US locations. There are several business units represented in Louisville, as well as a number of corporate and select functions of AEGON Asset Management. Additional efficiencies are also being captured through the consolidation and
outsourcing of certain back office activities currently carried out in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  As a consequence of the announced actions, AEGON
will reduce the number of employees in its US operations by 400 to 500 over the next two years, representing approximately 5% of its US workforce. These actions will result in a one-time restructuring charge of approximately USD 80 million, of
which USD 60 million will be charged in the fourth quarter this year and USD 20 million in 2011. In addition, AEGON’s decision to wind-down its BOLI/COLI business is expected to result in a write-off of goodwill and other intangible
assets of approximately USD 210 million. After full implementation of the restructuring, these organizational changes will result in annual cost savings of approximately USD 70 million.  In 2009, underlying earnings before tax from BOLI/COLI amounted to USD 47 million. As of the first quarter of 2011, earnings from the BOLI/COLI business will no longer be reported in underlying earnings
but in the run-off category.  “Key to AEGON’s long-term strategy is the need to focus on our core activities and identify ways to
better leverage resources and capture efficiencies, as evidenced by our decision to consolidate operations,” said Mark Mullin, a member of AEGON’s Management Board and CEO of AEGON Americas. “The decision to exit the executive
non-qualified benefit space and related BOLI/COLI market is consistent with this focus. We have concluded that over the long-term there is only a limited strategic fit between this business and AEGON’s core business. We remain committed to
providing existing customers the same level of quality service they have come to expect.”  Further details of AEGON’s progress in
the execution of its strategy in the United States and its other markets will be provided during AEGON’s Analyst & Investor Conference, December 7 and 8, 2010 in New York City.
