Coordination Letter
      
      
      Ladies
and Gentlemen:
      
      We refer you to the Amended and
Restated Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of December 10, 2009 (the
“Nestlé Registration
Rights Agreement”), between Alcon, Inc., a company organized under the
laws of Switzerland (the “Company”) and Nestlé
S.A., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland (“Nestlé”), and to the
Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of December 10, 2009 (the “Novartis Registration Rights
Agreement” and, together with the Nestlé Registration Rights Agreement,
the “Existing
Registration Rights Agreements”), between the Company and Novartis AG, a
company organized under the laws of Switzerland (“Novartis” and each of
Novartis and Nestlé, a “Shareholder”).  This
letter agreement sets forth our mutual understanding and agreement regarding the
modification of certain provisions of each Existing Registration Rights
Agreement, as well as the other matters contained herein, in each case to ensure
an orderly and efficient process for any future sales by Nestlé or Novartis of
any Registrable Securities and applicable solely in the event that the Purchase
and Option Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2008 (the “Purchase and Option
Agreement”), between Nestlé and Novartis is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.5 thereof (the date, if any, of such termination, the “P&O Termination
Date”).  Capitalized terms 
       
      
        
          
          
        
        
          
          
          
          
        
        
          
          
        
      
      used but
not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Nestlé Registration
Rights Agreement or the Novartis Registration Rights Agreement, as
applicable.
       
      Effective immediately upon the P&O
Termination Date, each Existing Registration Rights Agreement is hereby amended,
without the need for further action by any party, solely to the extent necessary
to give effect to the provisions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 12
below:
      
      
        

              
                1.  
              
              
                Notwithstanding
      Sections 2 and 4 of each Existing Registration Rights Agreement, Nestlé
      may only make a total of four requests for registration (“Demands”) under
      Sections 2(a) and 4(a) of the Nestlé Registration Rights Agreement, and
      Novartis may only make a total of four Demands under Sections 2(a) and
      4(a) of the Novartis Registration Rights Agreement. For purposes of this
      letter agreement a request for the filing of a Shelf Registration
      Statement under Section 4(a) of an Existing Registration Rights Agreement
      shall count as a single Demand but that separate requests to conduct
      individual “shelf takedowns” pursuant to the same Shelf Registration
      Statement shall not count as additional Demands (but, for the avoidance of
      doubt, shall constitute Offerings (as hereinafter defined) that are
      subject to the procedures set forth herein.  The Shareholder
      making a Demand shall copy the other Shareholder on the written demand
      notice (each such notice, a “Demand Notice”)
      delivered to the Company.  If at any time one but not both of
      Nestlé and Novartis shall beneficially own fewer than 5% of the total
      number of outstanding Common Shares, then the number of any unused Demands
      belonging to such former 5% Shareholder shall be automatically added
      to the number of any remaining Demands then held by such other
      Shareholder.  The Company’s obligations under Sections 2(a)
      and 4(a) of the respective Existing Registration Rights Agreements (and
      its concomitant obligations under Section 7 thereof) shall not apply
      to a Demand if, in the opinion of counsel to the Company delivered to the
      demanding Shareholder, (i) the proposed Offering can be made in the
      manner proposed by the demanding Shareholder without the necessity of
      registration of the securities to be offered under the Securities Act and
      (ii) the securities to be offered will be freely tradeable without
      restriction following such Offering; provided, however, that
      the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraph 5 below will
      continue to apply to such Offering and the Demand in respect of such
      Offering shall count as a Demand for purposes of this letter
      agreement.
              
            
      
       
      
        

              
                2.  
              
              
                (a)           Each
      Shareholder intending to conduct an offering of Registrable Securities (in
      such capacity, a “Requesting
      Shareholder”), whether pursuant to a Demand, a shelf takedown under
      a previously filed Shelf Registration Statement or some other form of
      offering or distribution (each such transaction, an “Offering”),
      shall give the other Shareholder (in such capacity, a “Non-Requesting
      Shareholder”) and the Company valid written notice (each such valid
      notice, an “Offer Notice”)
      of its intention
              
            
      
       
      
        
          2
        
        
          
          
          
          
        
        
          
          
        
      
      
        

              
                  
              
              
                to
      conduct such an Offering, which Offer Notice shall state that the Offering
      will occur within a period beginning on the Applicable Offering Period
      Start Date and ending 45 business days thereafter (the “Offering
      Period”).  The “Applicable Offering
      Period Start Date” means (i) if the Requesting Shareholder is the
      Priority Shareholder (as hereinafter defined) and a Demand Notice is not
      required, two business days after the date of such Offer Notice, (ii) if
      the Requesting Shareholder is the Priority Shareholder and a Demand Notice
      is required, five business days after the date of such Offer Notice, and
      (iii) if the Requesting Shareholder is not the Priority Shareholder, five
      business days after the earlier to occur of (A) receipt by the Company and
      the Requesting Shareholder of a copy of the written waiver from the
      Non-Requesting Shareholder of its right to deliver a Priority Notice (as
      hereinafter defined) or (B) the expiration of the Preemption Notice Period
      (as hereinafter defined) if a Priority Notice (as hereinafter defined) is
      not delivered during such period.  The notice requirement in
      this paragraph 2(a) is independent of any requirement to deliver a Demand
      Notice, if applicable.
              
            
      
       
      
        

              
                 
      
              
              
                (i)
              
              
                If
      the Requesting Shareholder is at the time of the Offer Notice the Priority
      Shareholder, then the Requesting Shareholder may proceed with the Offering
      contemplated by the Offer Notice and the Non-Requesting Shareholder shall
      not be permitted to participate in such Offering and shall be required to
      comply with paragraph 3 below.
              
            
      
       
      
        

              
                 
      
              
              
                (ii)
              
              
                If
      the Non-Requesting Shareholder is at the time of the Offer Notice the
      Priority Shareholder, such Non-Requesting Shareholder shall have until the
      later of (i) 210 calendar days after the pricing of the most recent
      offering by the Requesting Shareholder and (ii) 90 calendar days after the
      date of any such Offer Notice (the “Preemption Notice
      Period”) in which to give valid written notice (each such valid
      notice, a “Priority
      Notice”) to the Requesting Shareholder and the Company of its
      intention to conduct an Offering of its own, which Priority Notice shall
      state that the Offering will occur within an offering period (the “Preemption Offering
      Period”) beginning on the date that is two business days after the
      Company's and the Requesting Shareholder's receipt of such Priority Notice
      and ending 45 business days after the last day of the Preemption Notice
      Period.  In the event that a valid Priority Notice is delivered
      within the Preemption Notice Period, (A) the Offer Notice and any related
      Demand Notice delivered by the Requesting Shareholder shall be deemed to
      be null and void (and, in the case of a Demand Notice, shall not count as
      a Demand pursuant to paragraph 1), (B) the Priority Shareholder shall
      thereafter be deemed the Requesting Shareholder with respect to the
      Offering contemplated by the Priority Notice, and (C) the original
      Requesting Shareholder shall not be permitted to participate in such
      Offering and shall be required to comply with paragraph 3
      below.
              
            
      
       
       
      
        
          3
        
        
          
          
          
          
        
        
          
          
        
      
       
      
        

              
                 
      
              
              
                (iii)
              
              
                Any
      Offer Notice or Priority Notice must specify a good faith estimate of the
      number of Registrable Securities expected to be disposed of by the
      Requesting Shareholder or Priority Shareholder, as applicable, a good
      faith estimate of the launch date and pricing date for the proposed
      Offering and the intended method of distribution thereof.  An
      Offer Notice or a Priority Notice pursuant to which a Requesting
      Shareholder or Priority Shareholder proposes to conduct a “shelf takedown”
      Offering from an existing Shelf Registration Statement shall be valid only
      if such Offer Notice or Priority Notice (x) specifies a number of
      Registrable Securities (A) having an aggregate market value of at
      least U.S.$ 1 billion (calculated using the One Week VWAP (as defined in
      the Purchase and Option Agreement) as of the date of such Offer Notice or
      Priority Notice) or (B) representing at least 5% of the total number
      of outstanding Common Shares as of the date of such Offer Notice or
      Priority Notice and (y) states that such Offering is to be conducted
      pursuant to fixed price, firm commitment underwriting
      arrangements.
              
            
      
       
      (b)           If
the Non-Requesting Shareholder is at the time of the Offer Notice the Priority
Shareholder but does not deliver a valid Priority Notice within the Preemption
Notice Period or waives in writing its right to deliver a Priority Notice, then
the Requesting Shareholder may proceed with the Offering contemplated by the
Offer Notice on the Applicable Offering Period Start Date and the Non-Requesting
Shareholder shall not be permitted to participate in such Offering and shall be
required to comply with paragraph 3 below.
       
      (c)           A
Shareholder shall become the “Priority Shareholder”
and the previous Priority Shareholder shall cease to be the Priority Shareholder
either (i) upon the completion of an Offering by the previous Priority
Shareholder or (ii) if pricing of the relevant Offering triggered by the
delivery of a Offer Notice or Priority Notice by the previous Priority
Shareholder does not occur on or before 11:59 pm New York time, on the last day
of the applicable Offering Period or Preemption Offering Period (the “Outside Time”), as of
the Outside Time.  Initially, Novartis shall be the Priority
Shareholder.
       
      (d)           If
a Shareholder elects to sell or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or series
of related transactions, 20% or more of its Common Shares to a purchaser or
group of related purchasers in a private transaction not constituting an
Offering that is to be agreed, announced or consummated during such time as the
Stockholder is not the Priority Shareholder, then the Shareholder shall (i)
prior to reaching agreement in principle as to the price and form of
consideration to be paid for such Common Shares with the purchaser, give 60 days
prior written notice to the Priority Shareholder of such proposed transaction
and (ii) from time to time following any such notice, keep the Priority
Shareholder reasonably 
      
        
          4
        
        
          
          
          
          
        
        
          
          
        
      
      informed
regarding the proposed transaction, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii)
including the name of the proposed purchaser, the number of Common Shares to be
transferred and the proposed price and other material terms and conditions (to
the extent then known).
       
      
        

              
                3.  
              
              
                Unless
      the Requesting Shareholder in any Offering otherwise agrees, neither the
      Non-Requesting Shareholder nor the Company (other than, in the case of the
      Company, issuance of shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock
      options or other compensation plans) shall effect any sale, transfer or
      other distribution of Common Shares (or of any securities convertible into
      or exchangeable for Common Shares) during the period commencing on the
      date of the relevant Offer Notice or Priority Notice, as applicable, and
      ending on the earlier of (i) the expiration of 90 calendar days after the
      actual pricing date for the relevant Offering or (ii) if pricing of the
      relevant Offering does not occur on or before the relevant Outside Time,
      as of the Outside Time.
              
            
      
       
      
        

              
                4.  
              
              
                The
      Company shall use its best efforts to do all things required of the
      Company, including without limitation pursuant to Section 7 of the
      relevant Existing Registration Rights Agreement (and notwithstanding any
      time periods set forth therein that would be inconsistent with the time
      periods set forth herein), to permit the launch of any Offering as
      directed by the Requesting Shareholder (so long as such direction would
      cause the Offering to occur within the Offering Period).  In the
      event the Company’s efforts fail, however, the Offering Period shall be
      deemed to be extended for all purposes of this letter agreement by one day
      for each day by which the launch of the proposed Offering is delayed as a
      result of such failure; provided, however, that
      the Requesting Shareholder may cancel the proposed Offering if the pricing
      of the Offering is delayed by more than 15 calendar days as a result of
      such failure (or by more than 30 calendar days in the case of a delay
      resulting from a Disadvantageous Condition (as hereinafter defined)
      pursuant to paragraph 6 hereof), in which case the relevant Offer Notice,
      Demand Notice (if any) or Priority Notice, as applicable, shall be deemed
      null and void (and, in the case of a Demand Notice, shall not count as a
      Demand pursuant to paragraph 1).  Notwithstanding anything to
      the contrary in the Existing Registration Rights Agreements, the Company
      shall not be required to pay Registration Expenses pursuant to Section 5
      of the Existing Registration Rights Agreements for more than three Nestlé
      Offerings or more than two Novartis Offerings, whether or not the
      Registration Statement in respect of such Offering becomes effective and
      whether all, none or some of the Registrable Securities are sold pursuant
      to the applicable Registration Statement; provided that
      if the Company delivers a notice of Disadvantageous Condition with respect
      to a proposed Offering, such proposed Offering shall be included as one of
      the three (in the case of  Nestlé) or two (in the case of
      Novartis) Offerings subject to the foregoing limitation only if such
      proposed Offering is completed.
              
            
      
       
       
      
        
          5
        
        
          
          
          
          
        
        
          
          
        
      
       
      
        

              
                5.  
              
              
                If
      requested by a Shareholder in any Offering, the Company shall have
      appropriate officers of the Company (i) prepare and make presentations at
      any “road shows” and before analysts and rating agencies, as the case may
      be, and (ii) otherwise use their reasonable efforts to cooperate as
      requested by the Shareholder in the offering, marketing or selling of the
      Registrable Securities.
              
            
      
       
      
        

              
                6.  
              
              
                Notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary in either Existing Registration Rights Agreement
      or in this letter agreement, with respect to any Registration Statement
      filed, or to be filed, pursuant to either Existing Registration Rights
      Agreement, if there is material non-public information regarding the
      Company that relates to (i) a significant business opportunity (including
      the acquisition or disposition of assets (other than in the ordinary
      course of business) or any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
      spin-off, restructuring, reorganization, recapitalization, joint venture,
      tender offer or other similar transaction or corporate action) available
      to the Company or (ii) any other significant event or condition that, in
      the case of either clause (i) or (ii), the Company’s board of directors
      (the “Board”),
      including a majority of the members of the Board that are members of the
      Audit Committee of the Board, reasonably determines to be significantly
      disadvantageous for the Company to disclose and which the Company is not
      otherwise required to disclose at such time (each, a “Disadvantageous
      Condition”), and the Company shall furnish to the Shareholder
      requesting registration of Registrable Securities a resolution of the
      Board stating that the Company is deferring such registration pursuant to
      this paragraph 6 and setting forth in reasonable detail the
      Disadvantageous Condition (giving due regard to any confidentiality or
      competitive considerations), its reasons for such judgment and an
      approximation of the anticipated delay, then the Company shall be entitled
      to defer the filing of such Registration Statement (and, in the case of a
      Shelf Registration Statement that has already been filed, the Company
      shall not be required to file any amendment or supplement thereto required
      to permit a proposed Offering), until the earlier of (x) 45 calendar
      days following the date such resolution was delivered to the Shareholder
      requesting registration and (y) the date such Disadvantageous Condition no
      longer exists (notice of which the Company shall promptly deliver to the
      Shareholder requesting registration) (such period, a “Delay Period”)
      and upon receipt of any such notice of a Disadvantageous Condition the
      relevant Shareholder shall discontinue use of the prospectus contained in
      any such Registration Statement that has already been filed and, if so
      directed by the Company, shall deliver to the Company all copies, other
      than permanent file copies then in its possession, of the prospectus then
      covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of
      such notice.  The Company shall use commercially reasonable
      efforts to cause any Disadvantageous Condition arising under clause (ii)
      above to be resolved as promptly as practicable to permit the contemplated
      Offering to proceed.  The Company shall not be entitled to
      furnish more than one

                notice
      of Disadvantageous Condition to Nestlé in any twelve-month period, or more
      than one notice of Disadvantageous Condition to Novartis in any
      twelve-month period, in each case with respect to any Disadvantageous
      Condition arising under clause (i) above.  The Company shall not
      be entitled to furnish more than one notice of Disadvantageous Condition
      arising under either clause (i) or (ii) above with respect to the same or
      substantially similar facts and
circumstances.

                Each
      Shareholder hereby confirms that it has been advised that U.S. securities
      laws may prohibit a person who has material non-public information about a
      company from purchasing or selling securities of such company or from
      communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in
      which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person may purchase or sell
      such securities.  During a Delay Period the Shareholder
      requesting registration shall not offer or sell any securities of the
      Company in a manner that would reasonably be expected to result in
      liability to the Company or such Shareholder under U.S. securities laws to
      the extent any such liability would arise out of the use (or
      non-disclosure) of the information contained in the resolution of the
      Board stating that the Company is deferring the requested registration
      pursuant to paragraph 6.

                injury
      to the other party, for which damages, even if available, will not be an
      adequate remedy.  Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the
      issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to
      compel performance of such party’s obligations and to the granting by any
      court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder,

      Registration Rights Agreement are incorporated by reference herein, mutatis
      mutandis.  Except as expressly modified hereby, each

                In
      addition to the requirements set forth in the Existing Registration Rights
      Agreements, any transfer of rights pursuant to Section 11 thereof shall be
      effective only upon receipt by the Company of a written agreement from the
      Transferee to be bound by the terms of this letter
    agreement.

      letter agreement shall terminate automatically upon the Second Stage
      Closing (as defined in the Purchase and Option
  Agreement).
