Standards Codification 810-10 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 160) does not have an impact on Advantest’s consolidated
net loss during this period.
        
         
        
          <Reasons
for the Earnings Forecast for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31,
2010>
          We did not disclose the earnings
forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 in late October of last year
due to difficulty in forecasting trends in the demand for semiconductors and
investment plans for semiconductor related capital expenditure.
          At this time, we are able to disclose
the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, taking into
account trends in orders input received and other factors in the third
quarter.  Such earnings forecast is disclosed
above.

        <Reasons
for the Dividends Forecast>
        The
Company's basic policy with respect to dividends is that, while aiming to make
consistent distributions, because of the fluctuation of the market in which it
operates, the Company makes dividend payouts following a target payout ratio of
20% or more.
         
        
          
            
            
          
          
            
            
            
              
            
          
          
            
            
          
        
         
        Despite
forecasting net loss for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, the Company
plans to distribute a year-end dividend of ¥5.00 per share under the Company's
basic policy.
