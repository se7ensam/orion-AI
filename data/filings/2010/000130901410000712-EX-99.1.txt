Third Quarter 2010 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010 were RMB271.6 million (US$40.6
million), an increase of 23.7% from RMB219.6 million for the same quarter in 2009.


Print advertising revenues for the third quarter of 2010 decreased 19.6% to RMB62.0 million (US$9.3
million) compared with RMB77.1 million for the same quarter in 2009. The decline was primarily due
to a reduction in the number of cities where 51job Weekly is published, from 22 cities as of
September 30, 2009 to 16 cities as of September 30, 2010, which resulted in a 33.3% decrease in the
estimated number of print advertising pages generated in the third quarter of 2010 to 2,143
compared with 3,213 pages in the same quarter in 2009. However, although print advertising prices
in each city were largely unchanged, overall average revenue per page in the third quarter of 2010
increased 20.5% as compared to the same quarter of the prior year due to an increase in page volume
contribution from higher priced cities.


Online recruitment services revenues for the third quarter of 2010 were RMB142.7 million (US$21.3
million), representing a 58.4% increase from RMB90.1 million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The increase primarily resulted from a greater number of unique employers using the
Company’s online recruitment services. Driven by greater customer usage of online recruitment
services and sales expansion into new geographies, unique employers increased 55.9% to 142,098 in
the third quarter of 2010 compared with 91,167 in the same quarter of the prior year.


Other human resource related revenues for the third quarter of 2010 increased 27.8% to RMB66.9
million (US$10.0 million) from RMB52.4 million in the same quarter of 2009 primarily due to greater
market demand for our business process outsourcing, training and executive search services.


Gross profit for the third quarter of 2010 increased 35.8% to RMB176.1 million (US$26.3 million)
from RMB129.7 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is gross profit
as a percentage of net revenues, expanded to 68.4% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 62.4%
in the same quarter in 2009 primarily due to greater economies of scale, improved efficiency and a
decrease in printing-related expenses.


Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were RMB107.2 million (US$16.0 million) compared
with RMB89.6 million for the same quarter of 2009. Sales and marketing expenses for the third
quarter of 2010 increased 28.8% to RMB68.5 million (US$10.2 million) from RMB53.2 million for the
same quarter of the prior year primarily due to an increase in salaries and commissions resulting
from higher sales and headcount additions as well as greater advertising expenses. General and
administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2010 increased 6.1% to RMB38.7 million (US$5.8
million) compared with RMB36.5 million in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of higher employee
compensation expenses.


Income from operations for the third quarter of 2010 increased 72.0% to RMB68.9 million (US$10.3
million) from RMB40.1 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Operating margin, which is
income from operations as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 26.8% in the third quarter of
2010 compared with 19.3% in the same quarter of 2009. The reduction in the effective tax rate to
16.1% in the third quarter of 2010 from 30.1% in the third quarter of 2009 was primarily due to the
qualification of an operating entity as a High and New Technology Enterprise in December 2009,
which became subject to a preferential tax rate of 15%.


Net income for the third quarter of 2010 increased 75.3% to RMB62.9 million (US$9.4 million) from
RMB35.9 million for the same quarter in 2009. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the
third quarter of 2010 were RMB1.10 (US$0.16) compared with RMB0.65 for the same quarter in 2009.
Fully diluted earnings per ADS for the third quarter of 2010 were RMB2.20 (US$0.33) compared with
RMB1.29 in the third quarter of 2009.


In the third quarter of 2010, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB6.4 million (US$1.0 million) compared with RMB6.5 million in the third quarter of 2009. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation loss of RMB2.7 million (US$0.4 million) in
the third quarter of 2010 compared with RMB86,000 in the third quarter of 2009 due to an
appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.


Excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation loss as well as their
related tax impact, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2010 increased to RMB72.0
million (US$10.8 million) compared with RMB42.5 million for the third quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP
adjusted fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB1.26 (US$0.19) in the third quarter of
2010 compared with RMB0.77 in the third quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings
per ADS in the third quarter of 2010 were RMB2.52 (US$0.38) compared with RMB1.53 in the third
quarter of 2009.


Nine Months 2010 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were RMB788.3 million (US$117.8
million), an increase of 33.3% from RMB591.2 million in the comparable period in 2009. Income from
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased to RMB194.4 million (US$29.1
million) from RMB78.6 million for the same period last year.


Net income for the nine months of 2010 increased to RMB167.7 million (US$25.1 million) from RMB66.1
million for the same period in 2009. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the nine months
of 2010 increased to RMB2.99 (US$0.45) from RMB1.18 in the comparable period in 2009. Fully
diluted earnings per ADS for the nine months of 2010 were RMB5.97 (US$0.89) compared with RMB2.37
in the same period in 2009.


Excluding share-based compensation and foreign currency translation loss as well as their related
tax impact, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased to
RMB190.8 million (US$28.5 million) from RMB87.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2009. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB3.40 (US$0.51) in the nine
months of 2010 compared with RMB1.56 in the same period in 2009. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted
earnings per ADS in the nine months of 2010 were RMB6.79 (US$1.01) compared with RMB3.12 in the
same period in 2009.


As of September 30, 2010, the Company had cash and short-term investments totaling RMB1,512.6
million (US$226.1 million) compared with RMB1,214.7 million at December 31, 2009. Short-term
investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities from three months to one
year.


Business Outlook


For the fourth quarter of 2010, based on current market and operating conditions, the Company’s
revenue target is in the estimated range of RMB275 million to RMB285 million (US$41.1 million to
US$42.6 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense and any foreign currency translation
loss or gain as well as their related tax impact, the Company’s non-GAAP fully diluted earnings
target for the fourth quarter of 2010 is in the estimated range of RMB1.00 to RMB1.10 per common
share (US$0.30 to US$0.33 per ADS). The Company expects aggregate share-based compensation expense
in the fourth quarter of 2010 to be in the estimated range of RMB6 million to RMB7 million (US$0.9
million to US$1.0 million).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of income before
income tax expense, income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share and
adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude share-based
compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss as well as their related tax
impact. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense and its related tax impact
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company’s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company’s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss and its related tax impact
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation
gain or loss is not indicative of the Company’s core business operations and will not result in
cash settlement nor impact the Company’s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP
measures excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss
and their related tax impact are important in helping investors to understand the Company’s current
financial performance and future prospects and to compare business trends among different reporting
periods on a consistent basis. The presentation of these additional measures should not be
considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported
or forecasted by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in
the attached financial statements.
