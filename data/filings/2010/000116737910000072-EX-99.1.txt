HUENENBERG, Switzerland – April 26, 2010 – Alcon, Inc. (NYSE:ACL) reported that global sales rose 15.3 percent to $1.72 billion for the first quarter of 2010, or 9.6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions.  Revenue from acquisitions added 20 basis points to sales growth in the quarter.  U.S. health care reform reduced sales by $5 million in the quarter.

Net earnings for the first quarter of 2010 grew 26.8 percent to $573 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, compared to $452 million, or $1.51 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.  Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings would have grown 24.9 percent to $581 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 non-GAAP adjusted net earnings of $465 million, or $1.55 per diluted share.

Adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2010 exclude a $24 million pre-tax reduction to cost of goods sold related to a change in estimate for accrued royalties, $4 million in pre-tax other operating expenses related to the potential change of control and merger proposal from Novartis AG and a $25 million period tax charge related to a change in the tax treatment of retiree medical benefits in the United States included in the health care reform bill.  Adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2009 exclude $13 million of after-tax costs associated with a reduction in force.  Reconciliations of reported and adjusted results for the first quarter are included in the financial tables below.

“Our first quarter results reflect another strong quarter with solid sales growth driven by continued market share gains in most major product categories, balanced contributions from all geographic regions and generally improved market conditions.  Through the focused efforts of our entire organization, we also were able to translate that sales performance to faster growth in operating and net profit,” said Kevin Buehler, Alcon’s president and chief executive officer.  “With this start to the year, we are on track to post solid results in 2010 that reflect sustainable organic growth and operational leverage.”




Sales Highlights

Summarized below are sales highlights for the first quarter of 2010. All growth comparisons are for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Organic sales growth rates exclude currency impacts and acquisitions and are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled in a table at the end of this release.

 



  



  

  



  



 





Ø  


U.S. sales rose 10.3 percent due to strong contributions from advanced technology AcrySof® intraocular lenses, continued market share gains in glaucoma pharmaceuticals and growth in consumer eye care products.  Sales growth included 30 basis points from acquisitions and also benefitted from a more favorable market environment when compared to the first quarter of 2009.








Ø  


Sales in international markets increased 9.4 percent on an organic basis (+19.2 percent reported) due to balanced contributions from most global markets.  Developed international markets posted 8.0% organic growth (+17.0 reported).








o  


Sales in emerging markets increased 12.2 percent on an organic basis (+24.0 percent reported).  The BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) led emerging market growth, rising 22.4 percent organically (+41.3 percent reported).








Ø  


Global sales of pharmaceutical products were $728 million, an increase of 11.7 percent on an organic basis (+16.3 percent reported).  Sales of pharmaceutical products in international markets rose 13.5 percent organically (+22.6 percent reported) as prior investments in sales force expansions in Europe and Japan contributed to sustained market share gains.








o  


Global glaucoma pharmaceutical sales rose 24.0 percent organically (+30.0 percent reported), led by continued market penetration of AZARGA® outside the United States, resulting in a 23.3 percent organic increase in sales (+30.3 percent reported) of the Azopt® family of products (Azopt® and AZARGA® ophthalmic suspensions).  Additionally, global sales of the TRAVATAN® family of products (TRAVATAN®, TRAVATAN Z® and DuoTrav® ophthalmic solutions) rose 21.0 percent on an organic basis (+26.7 percent r
eported).








Ø  


Global surgical sales increased 8.3 percent on an organic basis (+14.7 percent reported), primarily attributable to a 10.9 percent organic rise (+17.3 percent reported) in sales of intraocular lenses.








o  


Global sales of advanced technology intraocular lenses rose 43.0 percent organically (+49.8 percent reported) on the continued success of the AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR® +3.0 lens and further adoption and utilization by cataract surgeons of the AcrySof® IQ Toric lens.








Ø  


Global sales of consumer eye care products rose 7.7 percent on an organic basis (+13.9 percent reported) to $221 million on the strong global performance of OPTI-FREE® RepleniSH® multi-purpose disinfecting solution and the Systane® family of lubricant eye drops.  This category also benefited from a favorable comparison to the first quarter of 2009 when retailers in the Unit
ed States reduced contact lens care inventories on hand, which reduced sales in that quarter.




 

Earnings Highlights

Summarized below are earnings highlights for the first quarter of 2010. All growth comparisons are for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009.





Ø  



Operating income rose 27.0 percent to $653 million, or 37.9 percent of sales.  Non-GAAP adjusted operating income would have increased 19.0 percent to $633 million, or 36.8 percent of sales.  This performance was attributable to strong sales growth, positive price contribution and SG&A leverage resulting from the company’s on-going cost management programs.  Adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2010 excludes a $24 million pre-tax reduction to cost of goods sold related to a change in estimate for accrued royalties and $4 million in pre-tax other operating expenses related to the potential change of control and the merger proposal from Novartis. Adjusted





 



  



  

  



  



 





  


operating income in the first quarter of 2009 excludes $18 million of pre-tax costs associated with a reduction in force.








Ø  


Net earnings in the first quarter of 2010 rose 26.8 percent to $573 million, or $1.89 per diluted share.  Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings would have risen 24.9 percent to $581 million, or $1.91 per diluted share.  In addition to the increase in operating income, this solid performance included an improvement in earnings on the company’s investment portfolio and lower foreign exchange losses.  Adjusted net earnings exclude the $21 million after-tax impact of the change in royalty estimates, $4 million in after-tax costs related to the potential change of control and the $25 million period tax charge related to health care reform in the United States.  Adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2009 exclude $13 million in after-tax costs associated with a reduction in force.




 




Other Highlights





Ø  


On March 29, 2010, Alcon announced it received regulatory approval and finalized the acquisition from Sirion Therapeutics, Inc. of the rights in the United States for Durezol™ ophthalmic steroid (topical ophthalmic corticosteroid for inflammation and pain associated with ocular surgery) and the global rights, excluding Latin America, for the development product Zyclorin™ ophthalmic formulation (under clinical investigation to treat dry eye and other ocular surface diseases).








Ø  


On March 31, 2010, Patanase® nasal spray received labeling approval for the indication of decreased symptoms related to itchy and watery eyes.








Ø  


On April 16, 2010, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan approved DuoTrav® combination ophthalmic solution for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.






Financial Guidance

The company reaffirmed its full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share and said it expects to be able to absorb the ongoing impact of health care reform in its 2010 targets.  Organic sales growth is expected to be in mid-to-high single digits, while earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $7.30 to $7.55.  The on-going impact of health care reform is expected to reduce 2010 sales by $20 million and earnings per share by $0.06.  The full year guidance assumes renewal of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2010 with retroactive application and excludes the adjustments made in the first quarter of 2010 and any future costs related to a potential change of control to and/or merger with Novartis.

N/M - Not Meaningful

Note: Change in constant currency calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Management believes constant currency sales change is an important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
