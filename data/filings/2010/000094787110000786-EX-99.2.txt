<Reasons for the earnings forecast for the six months ending September 30, 2010>

We did not disclose the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 in late April of this year due to the difficulty in forecasting trends in the demand for semiconductors and investment plans for semiconductor related capital expenditure.

At this time, we are able to disclose the earnings forecast for the six months ending September 30, 2010, taking into account trends in orders input received and other factors in the first quarter. Such earnings forecast is disclosed above.  As to the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, we intend to promptly disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes possible.

We plan to distribute interim dividend of ¥5.00 per share under our basic policy and the consolidated earnings forecast for the six months ending September 30, 2010. Regarding the dividend forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, we will take earnings forecast into consideration and intend to promptly disclose the relevant dividend forecast when such forecast becomes available.
