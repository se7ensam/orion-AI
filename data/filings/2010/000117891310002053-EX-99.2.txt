Exhibit 99.2

 

Chapter B of the Periodic Report

 

Directors' Report on the State of the Company's Affairs

for the six-month and three-month periods ended June 30, 2010

 

We respectfully present the Directors' Report on the state of affairs of Bezeq - The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Limited ("the Company") and the consolidated Group companies (the Company and the consolidated companies together are hereinafter referred to as “the Group"), for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 and for the three-month period then ended ("Quarter").

 

The Directors' Report contains a condensed review of its subject-matter, and it assumes that the Directors' Report at December 31, 2009 is also available to the reader.

 

Commencing August 21, 2009, the Company ceased to consolidate the financial reports of D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd. ("DBS"), and since that date its investment in DBS is stated by the equity method (see Note 4 to the financial statements). However, the Group continues to report on multi-channel television operations in its financial statements.

 

The Group's balance sheet at June 30, 2009 and the statements of cash flows for the period and the Quarter then ended, include DBS balances, while the income statement for the corresponding period and for the Quarter was restated and does not contain the results of DBS's operations as an ongoing operation.

 

The Group reports on four main segments in its financial statements:

 





1)


Fixed-line domestic communications




 





2)


Cellular




 





3)


International communications, internet and NEP services




 





4)


Multi-channel television




 

The Company has other areas of operation which are not material to the activities of the Group, and these are included in the financial statements as the “Other” business segment. This covers the operation of a portal and content sites and an online commercial site (through Walla), customer center services and investment in a venture capital fund.

 

Profit for the reporting period amounted to NIS 1,280 million1 compared with NIS 1,111 million in the corresponding period, an increase of approximately 15.2%. Profit attributed to the owners of the Company in the period was NIS 1,280 million, compared with NIS 1,149 million in the corresponding period, an increase of about 11.4%.

 

Profit for the reporting Quarter was NIS 638 million, compared with NIS 502 million in the corresponding quarter, an increase of approximately 27.1%. Profit attributed to the owners of the Company in the Quarter was NIS 638 million, compared with NIS 541 million in the corresponding quarter, an increase of about 17.9%.

 

The increase in profit in the period and in the Quarter stemmed primarily from a rise in revenue from ongoing operations and from other operations and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses, which were offset by an increase in operating and general expenses. Financing expenses also increased.

 

The increase in profit for the period and for the Quarter is in the fixed-line domestic communications segment, the cellular segment and the International communications, internet and NEP segment. See below for further details.

In this translation of the Directors' Report, all amounts should be understood by the reader to be rounded to the nearest million or thousand, as the case may be.




 



  



  







  



 





A. 


Board of Directors' explanations for the state of the Company's affairs, the results of its operations, its equity, cash flows and other matters




 










1.         Financial condition




 





  


a.


The Group's assets at June 30, 2010 amounted to NIS 13.82 billion, compared with NIS 14.62 billion on June 30, 2009, of which NIS 5.51 billion (40%) is property, plant and equipment, compared with NIS 6.17 billion (42%) on June 30, 2009.

 


The decrease in the Group’s assets stems from the termination of the consolidation of the results of operations of DBS in the Company's financial statements and the recording of the Company's investment in DBS by the equity method (DBS's assets at June 30, 2009 amounted to NIS 1.213 billion). The decrease is reflected mainly in property, plant and equipment and in broadcasting rights. Intangible assets also decreased, due to the write-off of goodwill. The decrease was offset by stating the investment in DBS at the date of exit from consolidation by the equity method at NIS 1.175 billion.

 

In addition, an increase of NIS 340 million in the Group's assets stemmed from the consolidation of the assets of Walla with those of the Group and recording surplus cost in intangible assets (see Note 5B to the financial statements). In addition, the assets of the cellular segment increased, an increase that was offset by a decrease in the assets of the fixed-line domestic communications segment (excluding investment in associates), and in the international communications, internet and NEP segment (excluding investment in associates), as explained below.

 

In the fixed-line domestic communications segment there was a decrease of NIS 144 million in assets, excluding investment in associates, compared with June 30, 2009, due mainly to a decrease in cash balances and in deferred tax balances, which were offset by an increase in the balances of property, plant and equipment and of intangible assets.

 

In the cellular segment, assets increased from NIS 4.77 billion on June 30, 2009 to NIS 4.85 billion at June 30, 2010. Most of the increase stems from a rise in customer balances, mainly due to an increase in revenue from sales of terminal equipment on installments.

 

In the international communications, internet and NEP services segment, assets (excluding investment in associates) decreased from NIS 1,062 million on June 30, 2009 to NIS 1,005 million at June 30, 2010. Most of the decrease stemmed from a decrease in cash balances, modified by additional acquisitions of capacity usage rights.

 

In the multi-channel television segment there was an increase in assets from NIS 1,213 million on June 30, 2009 to NIS 1,245 million at June 30, 2010, which stemmed mainly from an increase in net investment balances, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.





 





  


b.


The Group's debt to financial institutions and debenture holders at June 30, 2010 amounted to NIS 5.23 billion, compared with NIS 5.92 billion on June 30, 2009. The decrease stemmed primarily from the termination of the consolidation of DBS (DBS's debt to financial institutions and debenture holders on June 30, 2009 was NIS 1.75 billion), and also from repayment of debentures in the fixed-line domestic communications segment and in the cellular segment.

 

Conversely, debt to financial institutions in the fixed-line domestic communications segment increased due to loans received from banks (see Note 13B to the financial statements).

Fixed-line domestic communications segment

 

Revenue:

 

Segment revenue in the first half of 2010 totaled NIS 2,611 million compared with NIS 2,644 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of 1.2%.

 

Segment revenue in the Quarter totaled NIS 1,307 million compared with NIS 1,318 million in the corresponding quarter, a decrease of 0.8%.

 

The decrease in segment revenue stemmed primarily from a decrease in telephony revenues as a result of the fall in the number of lines and in call traffic, which was moderated by an increase in revenue from high-speed internet, data communication and transmission. In addition, revenue from interconnect fees to the cellular networks decreased in the first half compared with the corresponding period (with a corresponding decrease in the expense).

 

Costs and expenses:

 

Depreciation expenses in the first half of 2010 amounted to NIS 341 million compared with NIS 416 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of 18%.

 

Depreciation expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 171 million compared with NIS 205 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of 16.6%.

 

The source of the decrease is the end of depreciation of property, plant and equipment and a change in the salvage value of property, plant and equipment.

The salary expense in the Quarter amounted to NIS 250 million, compared with NIS 264 million in the corresponding quarter, a decrease of 5.3%.

 

The decrease in the salary expense in the half resulted mainly from an increase in salary attributed to investment as well as a decrease in the number of employees, which was moderated by a rise in salaries and a provision in respect of a retirement agreement with a previous CEO.

 

The decrease in the salary expense in Quarter stemmed primarily from revised provisions for employee benefits and the decrease in the number of employees, and was moderated by the rise in salaries.

 

Operating and general expenses in the first half of 2010 amounted to NIS 788 million compared with NIS 831 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of 5.2%.

 

Operating and general expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 396 million compared with NIS 411 million in the corresponding quarter, a decrease of 3.6%.

In addition, interconnect fees to the cellular networks in the first half decreased in parallel with a decrease in revenue from interconnect fees.

Other net operating income in the Quarter amounted to NIS 13 million, compared with income of NIS 4 million in the corresponding quarter.

 

The increase stems mainly from reducing provisions for legal claims in the Quarter and a rise in capital gains from the sale of properties and copper, as well as profit from hedging transactions on the price of copper. The increase was moderated by a rise in expenses in respect of early retirement severance liabilities.

 

Operating profit:

 

Operating profit in the segment in the first half of 2010 amounted to NIS 993 million compared with NIS 871 million in the corresponding period, an increase of 14%.

 

Operating profit in the segment in the Quarter amounted to NIS 503 million compared with NIS 434 million in the corresponding period, an increase of 15.9%.

Net finance expenses in the Quarter amounted to NIS 35 million, compared with NIS 1 million in the corresponding quarter. Most of the change in net finance expenses stems from the fixed-line domestic communications segment, mainly as a result of hedging transactions on the CPI, an increase in credit at fixed and variable shekel interest, and from a decrease in finance income from shareholder loans to DBS.

 

Conversely, interest expenses and linkage differentials in respect of debentures decreased, due to a lower rate of rise in the CPI and a decrease in total liabilities.

 





  


d.


Income tax




 

The Group's tax expenses in the reporting period amounted to NIS 462 million, representing approximately 26.5% of pre-tax profit, compared with NIS 443 million and 26.8% of pre-tax profit in the corresponding period.

 


  3.          Equity


 

Equity attributed to the Company's owners at June 30, 2010 amounted to NIS 5.4 billion, constituting 39.1% of the total balance sheet, compared with NIS 5.2 billion on June 30, 2009 and 35.6% of the balance sheet. The increase in equity stemmed mainly from the Group's profit, most of which was offset by the distribution of a dividend of NIS 3.6 billion during the second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010.

 


  4.          Cash flow


 

Consolidated cash flow for the six-month and three-month periods ended June 30, 2009 included cash flow from the activities of DBS (see Note 4 to the financial statements for details of the amounts). Consolidated cash flow for the present reporting period does not include those activities.




Consolidated cash flow generated by operating activities in the first half of 2010 amounted to NIS 1,782 million, compared with NIS 2,033 million in the corresponding period, a decrease of NIS 251 million. Most of the decrease stems from termination of consolidation of the financial statements of DBS (in the corresponding period, cash flow of NIS 184 million generated by the operating activities of DBS was included). In addition, cash flow from the operating activities of the fixed-line domestic communications segment decreased, mainly as a result of a decrease in current liabilities and an increase in current assets. The decrease was moderated by a rise in the cash flow from operating activities in the cellular segment, resulting from changes in the working capital and an increase in net profit.




Consolidated cash flow from operating activities in the Quarter amounted to NIS 976 million, compared with NIS 808 million in the corresponding quarter, an increase of NIS 168 million. The increase stems from the fixed-line domestic communications segment, mainly due to timing differences in payment to suppliers and other payables between the first and second quarters, and from the cellular segment due to changes in the working capital – primarily from changes in customers and an increase in net profit. The increase in consolidated cash flow was partially offset by the termination of consolidation of the financial statements of DBS (in the corresponding quarter, cash flow of NIS 93 million generated by the operating activities of DBS was included).






  



B - 9







  



 

Consolidated cash flow from operating activities is one of the sources for financing the Group's investments. In the reporting period these included NIS 607 million in the development of communications infrastructure and NIS 158 million in intangible assets and deferred expenses, compared with investment of NIS 756 million and NIS 156 million respectively in the corresponding period. In addition, NIS 30 million net was used in the Quarter for business combinations in the purchase of shares of Walla. In contrast, the cellular segment received net proceeds of NIS 110 million from the sale of an investment in a money market fund, compared with an investment of NIS 100 million in a money market fund in the corresponding period.




In the reporting period, the Group repaid net debts and paid interest amounting to NIS 1,221 million, of which NIS 622 million of debentures, NIS 424 million of loans and NIS 175 million of interest payments, compared with net debt repayment and interest payments of NIS 929 million in the corresponding period. Conversely, the Group received NIS 1,900 million in long-term loans, NIS 225 million in short-term credit, and NIS 18 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, compared with receipt of loans of NIS 400 million, short-term credit pf 41 million and proceeds of NIS 97 million from the exercise of employee stock options in the corresponding period.

Most of the increase in the working capital deficit of the Company stems from the decrease in cash balances and the increase in short-term financial liabilities. The increase in the Company's deficit was partially offset by termination of the consolidation of DBS in the Company's financial statements (the working capital deficit of DBS on June 30, 2009 was NIS 634 million). In addition, working capital increased in the cellular segment.




The Board of Directors of the Company reviewed the projected cash flow of the Company, including sources of credit and options for raising it, and determined that despite the deficit in working capital, the Company is not in liquidity difficulties.




The above description includes forward-looking information based on the Company's assessments. Actual results might differ substantially from these assessments if a change occurs in one of the factors taken into account in making them.

 


  5.           Explanations of the Board of Directors relating to market risks and their management


 





  


a.


Further to the description in the Directors' Report for 2009, hedging transactions against market risks associated with exposure to changes in exchange rates and to changes in the CPI, partially reduced this exposure.




 





  


b.


In April and May 2010, the Company raised NIS 1.9 billion of debt by means of loans from Israeli banks, of which NIS 400 million is against early repayment of bank loans raised in March 2009, as described in Note 13B to the financial statements. As a result, the surplus assets exposed to changes in the nominal shekel interest rate as was on December 31, 2009 decreased by NIS 820 million. In addition, during the reporting period the Company made hedging transactions on copper prices for 1,339 tons at USD 7,657 per ton, for a total value of USD 10.3 million. In addition, the sensitivity tests for the fair value and the effect of the change in the market prices on the fair value of the balances on and off the balance sheet for which there is a firm commitment at June 30, 2010, do not differ significantly from the report of December 31, 2009.

c.


The linkage bases report at June 30, 2010 does not differ significantly from the report of December 31, 2009, except for the decrease in CPI-linked liabilities of NIS 629 million, which stems mainly from repayment of debentures and loans in the Group.

The disclosure below is made pursuant to Article 8(a)(2) of the Regulations, concerning actions taken by the Group to the date of this report (beyond that described in Section 8C of the Directors Report for the year ended December 31, 2009).

C.           Disclosure concerning the Company’s financial reporting




 





1.            Critical accounting estimates




 

Preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRSs requires management to make assessments and estimates that affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, as well as disclosure in connection with contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases these assessments and estimates on past experience and on valuations, expert opinions and other factors which it believes are relevant in the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these assessments with different assumptions or conditions. The financial statements provide information about primary topics of uncertainty in critical estimates and judgments in the application of the accounting policy. We believe these assessments and estimates to be critical since any change in them and in the assumptions could potentially and materially affect
 the financial statements.

 










2.


Given the significance of the claims filed against the Group, which cannot yet be assessed or in respect of which the exposure cannot yet be calculated, the auditors drew attention to them in their opinion on the financial statements.




 





3.            Events after the balance sheet date




 

On August 2, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to recommend to the general meeting of the shareholders of the Company the distribution of a cash dividend of NIS 1,280 million to the shareholders.
