<P align=justify><B>July 6, 2010 - Alexco Resource Corp. (TSX:AXR, NYSE
AMEX:AXU) ("Alexco" or the </B><B>"Company") </B>is pleased to provide an update
on its Bellekeno Mine construction project, and exploration activities currently
underway in the Keno Hill Silver District, Yukon. Since initiating construction
in November 2009 and through the end of June 2010, Alexco has incurred
approximately CA$18.8 million, or 45%, of the CA$41.6 million of construction
and development capital estimated to achieve commercial production under the
original Development Plan. Prior to November 2009, approximately CA$17 million
was invested in pre-development activity including establishment of the
Bellekeno East decline. As of the end of June 2010, mine development is
approximately 69% complete, while mill construction is approximately 56%
complete, and the overall project remains on schedule for completion and
commissioning in the third quarter of calendar 2010 (see news release dated
November 11, 2009 entitled "Alexco Completes Positive Bellekeno Mine Development
Plan, Silver Wheaton Concurs -- Initiation of Construction Approved"). </P>
<P align=justify>Exploration activity in the District, initiated in April 2010,
is continuing with the staged increase to five drill rigs on site (four surface
and one underground) completed as planned and 6,500 meters of drilling completed
to date. Initial drilling activity has been focused at Silver King where 4,440
meters of drilling has indicated modest extension of silver mineralization down
plunge from prior drilling, and Onek where mineralization has been encountered
in a series of shallow drill holes. At Flame and Moth construction work in the
vicinity of the new mill has uncovered silver mineralization related to
large-scale structures in the area.</P>
<P align=justify>At the Bellekeno underground mine, cross cut development has
exposed up to 3.30 meters of 1,386 grams per tonne (40.4 ounces per ton) silver,
18.1% lead and 9.6% zinc located approximately 94 meters southwest along strike
from the 750 #1 cross cut where assays up to 57.3 ounces per ton silver over
6.04 meters were previously reported (see news release dated May 6, 2009 titled

<P align=justify style="margin-left: 3%">Final phase construction activity for the
Bellekeno mine was initiated in November 2009, with the
acceptance of the Development Plan by Silver Wheaton. The
scope of the construction project includes
re-development of the historical Bellekeno Mine workings,
construction of a new flotation mill with a design
capacity of 408 tonnes per day approximately 4.5 kilometers
from the Bellekeno East portal, and all associated
infrastructure.</P>
<P align=justify style="margin-left: 3%">The mechanical contractor is fully
mobilized to site and electrical contractors scheduled
within the next 3 weeks. The ball mill and vibrating
screens are in place, and installation of the
thickeners, flotation cells and other tankage is in
progress. Site earthworks including the mill apron,
bypass and access roads, concentrate load-out, dry stack
tailings, reclaim tunnels, and process ponds is 56% complete.
Office buildings, maintenance facilities, change
rooms etc. are all on site, and the assay laboratory will
be shipped next week. Approximately 67% of the estimated
cost at completion for the mill and surface infrastructure are now committed costs, reducing the pricing risk
in the project accordingly. A total of 39 mill construction
personnel are currently on site, increasing to 68
within the next few weeks. </P>
<P align=justify>As announced in March 2010, the mining
services contract for development and production mining at Bellekeno has been awarded to the NNDDC/Procon Joint Venture, a joint venture
between Procon Mining and Tunnelling Ltd. and the
Nacho Nyak Dun Development Corp. As of the end of June
2010, mine development, including underground mine services
and mine-related surface infrastructure, is 69% complete. The mine
continues to progress without a lost time accident
since inception of underground work in 2008, a credit to
mine supervisory staff and employees.</P>
<P align=justify>Permitting work is proceeding on schedule.
Issuance of the Type A Water Use Licence is the last step
in the permitting process for operation of the Bellekeno
mill, and is expected to be completed on schedule and prior
to commissioning and start-up of the mill in the
third quarter of calendar 2010. </P>

<P align=justify><B>District Exploration Update </B></P>
<P align=justify>The planned 2010 Keno Hill exploration
program includes 25,000 to 30,000 meters of surface
and underground core drilling designed to define and expand
silver mineralization and resources at Bellekeno, to
confirm and expand historical resources at Silver King,
Lucky Queen, Onek and to test other priority targets
throughout the district.</P>
<P align=justify>Silver King was the initial discovery in
the Keno Hill district with a total past production of
207,618 tons averaging 53.0 ounces per ton silver, 7.7% lead and 0.8% zinc. An historical resource estimate, for the area encompassing the existing underground workings,
totals 115,971 tons grading 43.89 opt silver, 1.38% lead
and 0.16% zinc. The bulk of the past production came from
the #1 and #2 veins whereas the majority of the
historical resource occurs in the #5 vein, the
primary targeted structure for the 2010 drilling. Assay results have been returned on 3 of the 20
Silver King holes drilled this year. K-10-0221
intersected 1.41 meters averaging 570 grams per tonne silver (16.6 ounces per ton) whereas K-10-0222, drilled
approximately 50m down dip of 0221 and K-10-0224,
drilled approximately 200m southwest of 0221 on the
#5 vein failed to intersect significant mineralization.
Though assays are pending for the majority of the Silver King drilling, observations of drill core indicate that, in
general, silver mineralization on the #5 vein is variable
both in terms of grade and continuity.</P>
<P align=justify>Drilling continues at Onek where past drilling
by Alexco intersected high grade zinc-silver
mineralization in numerous drill holes with assays up to
29.45% zinc over 6.0 meters (see news release dated
September 6, 2007 titled &#147;Alexco Announces Discovery of High Grade Zinc Mineralization with Silver at Onek
Deposit Located Near the Bellekeno Historic Mine Area;
Keno Hill District&#148;). The 2010 drilling is designed to test the upper parts of the historical Onek
resource area where chip sampling indicates the presence of more silver-rich mineralization. </P>
<P align=justify>Surface drilling has been initiated at Flame and Moth and Bellekeno with a significant resource
definition drilling campaign planned for Lucky Queen
also beginning in early July. Testing of several
exploration targets on Galena Hill will begin in August.</P>
<P align=justify>At Bellekeno a 5,000 meter underground
drill program is in progress. Drill testing of two target
areas in the East Zone was completed July 5<SUP>th</SUP>. A total of 352 meters of core
drilling in February confirmed that a historical rock chip
sample silver anomaly on the 625 level, SW of the
main East Zone resource, is localized in extent. A total of
1,338 meters of core drilling targeting the lower
East Zone inferred resource was completed in early
July. Assay results for drill hole BKUD10-184 (3.07 meters grading 27.33% zinc, 1.62 grams per tonne gold, 138 grams per tonne (4.0 ounces per ton) silver and
0.76% lead) confirm the presence of silver-bearing zinc
rich ore shoots typical of this area. All other
assay results are pending. Approximately 3,310 meters of
additional underground drilling is planned mainly
targeting resource expansion in the &#147;99&#148; and Southwest
zones.</P>
<P align=justify>Assay results from the 2010 Keno Hill drill program are
available for review on the Alexco Resource Corporation
website at www.alexcoresource.com. Plans/sections
for the areas drilled showing locations of the
completed drill holes are also available for review.

<P align=justify>As disclosed in the news release of November 11, 2009, the Bellekeno silver deposit
contains an indicated resource estimated at 401,000
tonnes grading 921 grams per tonne silver, 9.4% lead

estimated 871 grams per tonne silver, 9.5% lead and 5.6% zinc on a payable metals basis are included in the
initial mine plan. The deposit remains open down dip
and down plunge, and underground definition and
exploration drilling to expand the mineable resource
is currently underway in parallel with mine development
activities. </P>
<P align=justify>Once complete, the Bellekeno mine will
operate at 250 tonnes per day supplying feed to a
conventional flotation mill, producing up to 12,000

zinc concentrate annually and generating up to 2.8
million ounces of silver per year. Initial silver grades in 2010 and 2011 are expected to be approximately
1,000 grams per tonne. The mine and mill operations will
employ approximately 120 people and are expected to
directly invest more than $25 million annually for
labour, materials and supplies in the Yukon. Once
operational, the Bellekeno Mine will be Canada's only
primary silver mine and will be one of the highest
grade silver operations in the world. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Silver Wheaton Agreement</B> </P>
<P align=justify>In October 2008, Alexco entered into an
agreement under which Silver Wheaton Corp. (NYSE,
TSX:SLW) will purchase 25% of future Keno Hill
District silver production at a cost of US$3.90 per
ounce of silver delivered, plus up-front deposit payments to Alexco totaling US$50 million. An
initial US$15 million deposit payment was received
from Silver Wheaton in December 2008, with the
remaining US$35 million being provided for the
construction and development of the Bellekeno Mine
on a monthly draw-down basis subject to certain conditions
including Alexco having sufficient committed funds
available to complete construction and achieve
production within specified time frames.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Notes</B> </P>
<P align=justify>True widths have not been determined for
all the above reported drill intercepts but are believed to be representative of actual drill
thicknesses. </P>
<P align=justify>A rigorous quality control and quality
assurance protocol is used on the project, including blank,
duplicate and standard reference samples in each batch of 20 samples that were delivered to the lab. All drill core samples were shipped to Agat Laboratories at Whitehorse, YT or Vancouver, BC for preparation with
fire assay and multi-element ICP analyses done at
Agat Laboratories&#146; facility at Mississauga, ON. The 2010 exploration drill program and sampling protocol
has been reviewed, verified and compiled by Alexco&#146;s
geologic staff under the oversight of Stan Dodd, Vice
President, Exploration for Alexco and a Qualified
Person as defined by NI 43-101 who has also reviewed the
scientific and technical information about the
Bellekeno Mine project contained in this news
release.</P>

<P align=justify><B>Keno Hill Silver District History</B> </P>
<P align=justify>Between 1921 and 1988, the Keno Hill Silver
District produced more than 217 million ounces of
silver with average grades of 40.5 ounces per ton
silver, 5.6% lead and 3.1% zinc (Yukon Government's Minfile database). The historical production grades
would rank Keno Hill in the top 3% by grade of
today's global silver producers. The Keno Hill district is
the second-largest historical silver producer in
Canada. </P>
