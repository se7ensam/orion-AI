GENERAL PROXY INFORMATION 
This Circular is furnished in connection with the solicitation
of proxies by the management of the Corporation for use at the Meeting to be
held on December 17, 2010 and at any adjournments thereof. Unless the context
otherwise requires, references to the Corporation include the Corporation and
its subsidiaries. The solicitation will be conducted by mail and may be
supplemented by telephone, electronic or other personal contact to be made
without special compensation by the directors, officers and employees. The cost
of solicitation will be borne by the Corporation. 
Appointment of Proxyholder 
The purpose of a proxy is to designate persons who will vote
the proxy on a Shareholder's behalf in accordance with the instructions given by
the Shareholder in the proxy. The persons whose names are printed in the
enclosed form of proxy for the Meeting are officers or directors of the
Corporation (the "Management Proxyholders"). 
A Shareholder has the right to appoint a person other than a
Management Proxyholder to represent the Shareholder at the Meeting by striking
out the names of the Management Proxyholders and by inserting the desired
person's name in the blank space provided or by executing a proxy in a form
similar to the enclosed form. A proxyholder need not be a Shareholder. 
Voting by Proxy 
Only registered Shareholders or duly appointed proxyholders
are permitted to vote at the Meeting.
Shares represented by properly executed proxies in the
accompanying form will be voted or withheld from voting on each respective
matter in accordance with the instructions of the Shareholder on any ballot that
may be conducted. 
If no choice is specified and one of the Management
Proxyholders is appointed by a Shareholder as proxyholder, such person will vote
in favour of the matters proposed at the Meeting and for all other matters
proposed by management at the Meeting. 
The enclosed form of proxy also confers discretionary
authority upon the person named therein as proxyholder with respect to
amendments or variations to matters identified in the notice of the Meeting and
with respect to other matters which may properly come before the Meeting. At
the date of this Circular, management knows of no such amendments, variations or
other matters to come before the Meeting. 
Completion and Return of Proxy 
Completed forms of proxy must be deposited at the office of the
Corporation's registrar and transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services
Inc., Proxy Department, 100 University Avenue, 9th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5J
2Y1, not later than forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays, prior to the time of the Meeting, unless the chairman of the Meeting
elects to exercise his discretion to accept proxies received subsequently. 
Non-Registered Holders 
Only registered Shareholders or duly appointed proxyholders
are permitted to vote at the Meeting. Most Shareholders are "non-registered"
Shareholders because the Shares they own are not registered in their names but
are instead registered in the name of the brokerage firm, bank or trust company
through which they purchased the Shares. More particularly, a person is not
a registered Shareholder in respect of Shares which are held on behalf of that
person (the "Non-Registered Holder") but which are registered either: (a)
in the name of an intermediary (an "Intermediary") that the
Non-Registered Holder deals with in respect of the Shares (Intermediaries
include, among others, banks, trust companies, securities dealers or brokers and
trustees or administrators of self-administered RRSP's, RRIFs,
RESPs and similar plans); or (b) in the name of a clearing agency (such as CDS
Clearing and Depository Services Inc. ("CDS")) of which the Intermediary
is a participant. In accordance with the requirements of National Instrument
54-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the Corporation has
distributed copies of the Notice of Meeting, this Circular, the proxy and other
materials (collectively, the "Meeting Materials") to the clearing
agencies and Intermediaries for onward distribution to Non-Registered Holders. 


- 3 - 
Intermediaries are required to forward the Meeting Materials to
Non-Registered Holders unless a Non-Registered Holder has waived the right to
receive them. Very often, Intermediaries will use service companies to forward
the Meeting Materials to Non-Registered Holders. Generally, Non-Registered
Holders who have not waived the right to receive Meeting Materials will either:



  
    (a) 
    
      be given a form of proxy which has already been signed
      by the Intermediary (typically by a facsimile, stamped signature),
      which is restricted as to the number of Shares beneficially owned by the
      Non-Registered Holder but which is otherwise not completed. Because the
      Intermediary has already signed the form of proxy, this form of proxy is
      not required to be signed by the Non-Registered Holder when submitting the
      proxy. In this case, the Non-Registered Holder who wishes to submit a
      proxy should otherwise properly complete the form of proxy and deliver
      it to either the Corporation or the transfer agent as provided above;
      or
  
     
     
  
    (b) 
    
      more typically, be given a voting instruction form
      which is not signed by the Intermediary, and which, when properly
      completed and signed by the Non-Registered Holder and returned to the
      Intermediary or its service company, will constitute voting
      instructions (often called a "proxy authorization form") which the
      Intermediary must follow. Typically, the proxy authorization form will
      consist of a one page pre-printed form. Sometimes, instead of the one page
      pre-printed form, the proxy authorization form will consist of a regular
      printed proxy form accompanied by a page of instructions which contains a
      removable label containing a bar-code and other information. In order for
      the form of proxy to validly constitute a proxy authorization form, the
      Non-Registered Holder must remove the label from the instructions and
      affix it to the form of proxy, properly complete and sign the form of
      proxy and return it to the Intermediary or its service company in
      accordance with the instructions of the Intermediary or its service
      company.
In either case, the purpose of this procedure is to permit
Non-Registered Holders to direct the voting of the Shares which they
beneficially own. Should a Non-Registered Holder who receives one of the above
forms wish to vote at the Meeting in person, the Non-Registered Holder should
strike out the names of the Management Proxyholders and insert the
Non-Registered Holder's name in the blank space provided. In either case,
Non-Registered Holders should carefully follow the instructions of their
Intermediary, including those regarding when and where the proxy or proxy
authorization form is to be delivered. 
There are two kinds of "non-registered" or "beneficial" holders
- - those who object to their name being made known to the issuers of securities
which they own (called "OBOs" for Objecting Beneficial Owners) and those
who do not object to the issuers of the securities they own knowing who they are
(called "NOBOs" for Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners). Subject to the
provision of National Instrument 54-101 Communication with Beneficial Owners
of Securities of Reporting Issuers ("NI 54-101"), issuers can
request and obtain a list of their NOBOs from intermediaries via their transfer
agents. Issuers can obtain and use this NOBO list for distribution of
proxy-related materials directly (not via ADP) to NOBOs.
The Corporation has decided to take advantage of those
provisions of NI 54-101 that permit it to directly deliver proxy-related
materials to its NOBOs. As a result, NOBOs can expect to receive a scannable
Voting Instruction Form ("VIF") from the Corporation's transfer agent,
Computershare Investor Services Inc. These VIFs are to be completed and returned
to the transfer agent in the envelope provided or by facsimile. In addition, the
transfer agent provides both telephone voting and internet voting as described
on the VIF itself. The transfer agent will tabulate the results of the VIFs received from NOBOs and will
provide appropriate instructions at the Meeting with respect to the Shares
represented by the VIFs they receive. 


- 4 - 
Revocability of Proxy 
Any registered Shareholder who has returned a proxy may revoke
it at any time before it has been exercised. In addition to revocation in any
other manner permitted by law, a proxy may be revoked by instrument in writing,
including a proxy bearing a later date, executed by the registered Shareholder
or by attorney authorized in writing or, if the registered Shareholder is a
corporation, under its corporate seal or by an officer or attorney thereof duly
authorized. The instrument revoking the proxy must be deposited at the
registered office of the Corporation, at any time up to and including the last
business day preceding the date of the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, or
with the chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting. Only registered
Shareholders have the right to revoke a proxy. Non-Registered Holders who wish
to change their vote must, at least seven days before the Meeting, arrange for
their respective Intermediaries to revoke the proxy on their behalf.
INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS OR COMPANIES IN MATTERS TO BE
ACTED UPON 
Except as otherwise disclosed, to the knowledge of the
Corporation, no director or executive officer since the commencement of the
Corporation's last completed fiscal year, proposed nominee of management for
election as a director, or any associate or affiliate of the foregoing persons,
has any material interest, direct or indirect, by way of beneficial ownership of
securities or otherwise, in any matters to be acted upon at the Meeting other
than the election of directors and the appointment of the auditor. 
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF VOTING SECURITIES

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes
and explains the significant elements of the Corporation's compensation
programs, with particular emphasis on the process for determining compensation
payable to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the three
most highly compensated executive officers (other than the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer), at the end of the most recently completed
financial year (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers"). 
Objectives of Compensation Programs 
The objectives of the Corporation's compensation programs are
to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified executive officers who will
drive the success of the Corporation, while at the same time promote a greater
alignment of interests between such executive officers and the Corporation's
shareholders. The Corporation's compensation programs are designed to recruit
and retain key individuals and reward individual and company performance with
compensation that has long-term growth potential, while recognizing that the
executives work as a team to achieve corporate results. 


- 7 - 
Elements of Compensation 
Compensation is comprised of three main components: base
salary, annual bonus incentive and stock options. 


  
    1. 
    
      Base Salary - The primary element of the
      Corporation's compensation program is base salary. The Corporation's view
      is that a competitive base salary is a necessary element for retaining
      qualified executive officers. The amount payable to an executive officer
      as base salary is determined primarily by the number of years experience,
      personal performance, and by comparisons to the base salaries and total
      compensation paid to executives of comparable publicly-traded companies
      within the Canadian mineral exploration sector.
  
     
     
  
    2. 
    
      Annual Bonus - Along with the establishment of
      competitive base salaries and long-term incentives, one of the objectives
      of the executive compensation strategy is to encourage and recognize
      strong levels of performance by linking achievement of corporate goals and
      objectives with variable cash compensation in the form of an annual bonus.
      Bonuses awarded are determined by reference to the success of the
      Corporation and each executive officer's contribution in the year, as
      determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
  
     
     
  
    3. 
    
      Stock Options - The Stock Option Plan is designed
      to give each option holder an interest in preserving and maximizing
      shareholder value in the longer term, to enable the Corporation to attract
      and retain individuals with experience and ability, and to reward
      individuals for current performance and expected future performance. Stock
      option grants are considered when reviewing executive officer compensation
      packages as a whole. The options generally have a seven-year term and an
      exercise price equal to the fair value of the common shares as at the
      granting date. The periodic award of options under the Stock Option Plan
      is determined by the Board of Directors, is discretionary and takes into
      account previous option awards.
Compensation Committee 
The Corporation has a Compensation Committee comprised of
Michael D. Winn, David H. Searle and George Brack. Responsibility for the
determination of compensation of executive officers has been delegated to this
committee. The Compensation Committee annually reviews each of the above
components and relevant competitive factors and makes recommendations based on
corporate and individual performance, taking into account leadership abilities,
retention, risk and succession plans. Interested executives do not participate
in reviews, discussions or decisions of the Board of Directors regarding this
remuneration.

      Salary is paid in US currency to Clynton Nauman, Bradley
      Thrall, Thomas Fudge and Timothy Hall. The exchange rates used to convert
      the amounts to Canadian currency for the years ended June 30, 2010 and
      2009 were US$1.00 = C$1.0560 and US$1.00 = C$1.1549,
  respectively.

      This column includes the grant date fair value of all
      options granted by the Corporation to the Named Executive Officers during
      the indicated year. All grant date fair values equal the accounting fair
      values determined for financial reporting purposes in accordance with
      Section 3870 of the CICA Handbook. The grant date fair value of all
      options granted during the year ended June 30, 2010 was estimated using
      the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming a risk-free interest rate
      of 2.47% per annum, an expected life of options of 4 years, an expected
      volatility of 76% and no expected dividends. The grant date fair value of
      all options granted during the year ended June 30, 2009 was estimated
      using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming a risk-free
      interest rate of 1.77% per annum, an expected life of options of 4 years,
      an expected volatility of 82% and no expected dividends. The Black-Scholes
      options pricing model has been used to determine grant date fair value due
      to its wide acceptance across industry as an option valuation model, and
      because it is the same model the Corporation uses to value options for
      financial reporting purposes.

      As at June 30, 2010, neither Mr. Fudge nor Mr. Hall were
      considered “executive officers” under general securities regulation.
      However, for purposes of Executive Compensation disclosure in this
      Circular they are deemed Named Executive Officers by virtue of paragraph
      (d) of the definition of such term pursuant to Form 51-102F6 Statement
      of Executive Compensation of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous
      Disclosure Obligations.

      Mr. Fudge joined the Corporation on February 2, 2009
      which resulted in a lower prorated salary for the year ended June 30,
      2009.

      common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") on June 30,
      2010, which was $3.31 and the exercise price of the
  options.

Pension Plan Benefits 
The Corporation does not have any form of pension plan that
provides for payments or benefits to the Named Executive Officers at, following,
or in connection with retirement. The Corporation does not have any form of
deferred compensation plan. 
Employment Contracts with Named Executive Officers 
The Corporation entered into current employment agreements
("Executive Employment Agreements") dated effective January 1, 2007 with
Mr. Nauman and Mr. Thrall, dated effective October 9, 2007 with Mr. Whittle,
dated effective November 16, 2009 with Mr. Fudge and dated effective February 2,
2007 with Mr. Hall. 
Except for the specific duties of each Executive and other than
as set forth below, the material provisions of such Executive Employment
Agreements are substantially identical. Each Executive Employment Agreement is
for an indefinite period unless terminated by either the Corporation or the
respective Executive in accordance with the provisions thereof as described
below. 
For the financial year ended June 30, 2010 and pursuant to
their respective Executive Employment Agreements, Mr. Nauman, Mr. Thrall, Mr.
Whittle, Mr. Fudge and Mr. Hall were entitled to annual base salaries, paid
semi-monthly, of US$300,000, US$250,000, $220,000, US$190,000 and US$180,000,
respectively. Such annual base salaries are subject to annual review by the
Corporation. 
With respect to Mr. Nauman, Mr. Thrall, Mr. Whittle and Mr.
Fudge, each Executive Employment Agreement may be terminated by the Corporation
upon the Executive dying or becoming permanently disabled or disabled for a
period exceeding 180 consecutive or 180 non-consecutive days calculated on a
cumulative basis over any two year period during the term of the agreement, or
voluntarily by the Executive with three month's notice to the Corporation for
Mr. Nauman, Mr. Thrall and Mr. Fudge and six week’s notice to the Corporation
for Mr. Whittle. With respect to each of these four Executive Employment
Agreements, in the event of termination by the Corporation without just cause or
termination by the Executive or unremedied material breach or default of the
agreement by the Corporation, and with respect to all the Executive Employment
Agreements in the event of termination by the Executive upon a change of control
as further described below, the Executive will be entitled to receive a
severance payment equal to all compensation (salary plus annual bonus) paid to
the Executive under the agreement for the previous fiscal year multiplied by
two, and the Corporation shall also continue the Executives' group insurance
benefits for 12 months after the date of termination. In the event of
termination by the Corporation upon the Executive dying or becoming disabled as
described above and so long as the Executive receives life insurance or
long-term disability benefits under the Corporation’s benefit plans, the
Executive will be entitled to receive his then-current salary for one year. If
the Executive does not receive such benefits, other than for acts of the
Executive resulting in lawful denial of such coverage, then the Executive shall
be entitled to receive the amounts due in the event of termination without
cause. In the event of termination by the Corporation for just cause, or voluntary termination by
the Executive, the Executive shall not be entitled to receive any incremental
payments or benefits. 


- 11 - 
In the event that a change of control (as defined in the
Executive Employment Agreements) of the Corporation occurs, each Executive may
terminate his obligations under the agreement by providing one month's notice in
writing to the Corporation at any time between the 90th day and the
180th day following the date on which there is a change of control
(at any time within 90 days of the change of control in the case of Mr.
Hall).
With respect to Mr. Nauman, Mr. Thrall, Mr. Whittle and Mr.
Fudge, if the Executive's employment with the Corporation is terminated, and
within two years of such termination (three years for Mr. Whittle and Mr. Fudge)
the Executive acquires directly or indirectly other than from the Corporation or
its subsidiaries any present or future interest in any mining claims or
properties or mineral interests within 10 kilometres of the external boundaries
of any mineral property held by the Corporation during the time the Executive
was employed by the Corporation, the Executive will offer the Corporation, in
writing, the right to acquire such interest in exchange for reimbursement of his
direct or indirect acquisition costs. The Corporation shall have 30 days after
receipt of such offer to accept the offer and 90 days after receipt of such
offer to reimburse such costs. 
If Mr. Fudge's employment is terminated, for a period of one
year after the date of termination of his employment, Mr. Fudge will not,
without the Corporation's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, either individually or in partnership or in conjunction
with any person or persons, firm, association, syndicate or corporation, as
principal, agent, director, officer, employee, investor or in any other matter
whatsoever, directly or indirectly, carry on, be engaged in, be interested in or
connected with a business having business activities, in any of the Yukon,
Northwest Territories or British Columbia, similar to those conducted by the
Corporation and its subsidiaries at the date of such termination. 
Termination and Change of Control Benefits 
The following table discloses the estimated incremental amounts
payable to the Named Executive Officers under a number of termination or
change-of-control circumstances, other than termination by the Corporation for
just cause or voluntary termination by the Executive. Amounts disclosed in the
table below assume that a change-in-control occurred and/or the Named Executive
Officer's employment terminated on June 30, 2010.

Performance Graph 
The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in
the cumulative total shareholder return of the Shares, assuming a $100
investment in the Shares on January 26, 2006, with the S&P/TSX Composite
Index, assuming dividend reinvestment.
The Shares closed at $3.31 on June 30, 2010, which was 50%
higher than the opening price of $2.21 on July 2, 2009. This reflects, in part,
the direct impact of higher commodity prices and an improvement to capital
markets from the economic crisis experienced by the mining and energy sectors
during the later part of calendar 2008 and 2009. 
Changes in compensation levels for the Named Executive Officers
have generally been consistent with the increase in shareholder value over the
period 2006 to 2010 especially when considering the period prior to the onset of
the financial market crisis in latter calendar 2008. The level of compensation
paid to the Named Executive Officers has also been reflective of the significant
advancements made at the Corporation's Keno Hill district properties in the
Yukon through this period, and at the Bellekeno project in particular.
Compensation for the Named Executive Officers also demonstrates the high level
of "at risk" or variable compensation that forms part of the total compensation
program for the Corporation's executives. 
 
Director Compensation 
The Corporation's directors are compensated for their services
with an annual fee, as well as by the grant of stock options under the
Corporation's Stock Option Plan. At January 1, 2010, the Corporation increased
the directors' annual fee from $15,000 to $24,000, with the Chair of the Board
and the Chair of the Audit Committee each receiving an additional amount of
$5,000 for their services. Directors are reimbursed for individual travel and
other ancillary expenses incurred in connection with attending board and
committee meetings. 
The following table sets forth information concerning
compensation and grants of options to purchase securities of the Corporation
made during the most recently completed financial year to the directors of the
Corporation (excluding the Named Executive Officers):

      This column includes the grant date fair value of all
      options granted by the Corporation to the Directors during the indicated
      year. All grant date fair values equal the accounting fair values
      determined for financial reporting purposes in accordance with Section
      3870 of the CICA Handbook. The grant date fair values of all options

Stock Option Plan 
The purpose of the Stock Option Plan is to attract and motivate
directors, officers, employees of and service providers to the Corporation and
its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Optionees") and thereby advance the
Corporation's interests by affording such persons with an opportunity to acquire
an equity interest in the Corporation through the stock options. The Stock
Option Plan authorizes the board of directors (or compensation committee) to
grant stock options to the Optionees on the following terms: 


  
    1. 
    
      The number of Shares subject to each stock option is
      determined by the board of directors (or compensation committee) provided
      that the Stock Option Plan, together with all other previously established
      or proposed share compensation arrangements, may not result in:
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (a) 
    
      the number of Shares of the Corporation reserved for
      issuance pursuant to stock options granted to insiders exceeding 10% of
      the outstanding issue;
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (b) 
    
      the issuance, to insiders of the Corporation of a number
      of Shares of the Corporation exceeding, within a one year period, 10% of
      the outstanding issue; or
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (c) 
    
      the issuance, to any one insider of the Corporation and
      such insider's associates, of a number of Shares of the Corporation
      exceeding, within a one year period, 10% of the outstanding
  issue.


- 15 - 


  
    
    
      The outstanding issue is determined on the basis of the
      number of Shares of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to any
      Share issuance, excluding Shares issued pursuant to share compensation
      arrangements over the preceding one-year period.
  
     
     
     
  
    2. 
    
      The maximum number of Shares of the Corporation which may
      be issued pursuant to stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan,
      unless otherwise approved by Shareholders, is 10% of the issued and
      outstanding Shares at the time of the grant. Any increase in the issued
      and outstanding Shares will result in an increase in the available number
      of Shares issuable under the 10% Rolling Stock Option Plan, and any
      exercises of stock options will make new grants available under the
      plan.
  
     
     
     
  
    3. 
    
      The Stock Option Plan must be approved and ratified by
      Shareholders every three years.
  
     
     
     
  
    4. 
    
      The exercise price of an option may not be set at less
      than the closing price of the Shares of the Corporation on the Toronto
      Stock Exchange (the "TSX") on the trading day immediately preceding
      the date of grant of the option.
  
     
     
     
  
    5. 
    
      The options may be exercisable for a period of up to
      seven years, such period and any vesting schedule to be determined by the
      board of directors (or compensation committee) of the Corporation, and are
      non-assignable, except in certain circumstances.
  
     
     
     
  
    6. 
    
      The options can be exercised by the Optionee as long as
      the Optionee is a director, officer, employee or service provider to the
      Corporation or its subsidiaries or within a period of not more than 30
      days after ceasing to be a director, officer, employee or service provider
      (or such longer period as may be approved by the board of directors of the
      Corporation and, if required, the TSX) or, if the Optionee dies, within
      one year from the date of the Optionee's death.
  
     
     
     
  
    7. 
    
      On the receipt of a takeover bid, issuer bid, going
      private transaction or change of control, any unvested options shall be
      immediately exercisable.
  
     
     
     
  
    8. 
    
      The directors may from time to time in the absolute
      discretion of the Directors amend, modify and change the provisions of an
      option or the Stock Option Plan without obtaining approval of Shareholders
      to:
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (a) 
    
      make amendments of a "housekeeping" nature;
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (b) 
    
      change vesting provisions;
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (c) 
    
      change termination provisions for an insider provided
      that the expiry date does not extend beyond the original expiry
    date;
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (d) 
    
      change termination provisions which does extend beyond
      the original expiry date for an optionee who is not an insider;
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (e) 
    
      reduce the exercise price of an option for an optionee
      who is not an insider;
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (f) 
    
      implement a cashless exercise feature, payable in cash or
      securities, provided that such feature provides for a full deduction of
      the number of Shares from the number of Shares reserved under the Stock
      Option Plan; and
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (g) 
    
      make any other amendments of a non-material nature which
      are approved by the TSX.
All other amendments will require
approval of Shareholders and the TSX. 
The effect of the Stock Option Plan is that at any point in
time, the Corporation may have stock options outstanding for the purchase of up
to 10% of issued capital of the Corporation. 


- 16 - 
There are currently 3,975,081 stock options issued and
outstanding under the Stock Option Plan, and 150,000 stock options issued and
outstanding outside the Stock Option Plan, representing 7.4% and 0.3%
respectively, of the Corporation's issued and outstanding Share capital, as at
November 12, 2010. 
Based upon the Corporation's issued and outstanding Shares as
at November 12, 2010 and the number of currently outstanding stock options, the
Corporation can issue stock options for an additional 1,425,379 Shares under the
Stock Option Plan, representing 2.6% of the Corporation’s issued and outstanding
Share capital as at November 12, 2010. Additional stock options may be granted
as additional Shares are issued. 
During the financial year ended June 30, 2010, an aggregate of
425,000 and 575,000 stock options were granted under the Stock Option Plan to
directors and officers of the Corporation and to employees of the Corporation,
respectively. During the financial year ended June 30, 2010, an aggregate of nil
and nil Shares were acquired on exercise of stock options by the directors and
officers of the Corporation and the employees of the Corporation, respectively.

INDEBTEDNESS TO CORPORATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

No director, executive officer, proposed nominee for election
as a director or associate of them, is or, since the beginning of the last
completed financial year of the Corporation, was indebted to or guaranteed or
supported by the Corporation either pursuant to an employee stock purchase
program or otherwise. 
INTEREST OF INFORMED PERSONS IN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS

No informed person, officer or proposed director and no
associate or affiliate of the foregoing persons has or has had any material

Corporation's most recently completed financial year or in any proposed
transaction which in either such case has materially affected or would
materially affect the Corporation. 
APPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Chartered Accountants, of
Vancouver, British Columbia are the auditors for the Corporation. Unless
otherwise instructed, the proxies given pursuant to this solicitation will be
voted for the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the auditor to hold
office for the ensuing year at remuneration and on terms of engagement to be

MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

substantial degree by a person other than the directors or executive officers.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE 
TSX listed companies are required to describe, on an annual
basis, their practices and policies with regards to corporate governance by way
of a corporate governance statement contained in the Corporation's annual report
or information circular. The disclosure is required to be made pursuant to
National Instrument 58-101, Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices,
and the guidelines contained in National Policy 58-201, Corporate Governance
Guidelines, against which the Corporation has reviewed its own corporate
governance practices. In certain cases, the Corporation's practices comply with
the guidelines; however, the Board considers that some of the guidelines are not
suitable for the Corporation at its current stage of development and therefore
these guidelines have not been adopted.


- 17 - 
Directors' Independence 
The Corporation's Board consists of six directors, four of whom
the Corporation believes to be independent based upon the tests for independence
set forth in National Instrument 52-110, Audit Committees ("NI
52-110"). The Corporation considers Messrs. Winn, Searle, Krepiakevich and
Brack to be independent. Mr. Nauman is not independent as he is the President
and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, while Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse is
not independent as he is the Chief Executive Officer of a company which provides
certain consulting services to the Corporation. 
The Board has recently initiated a practice of having the
non-executive directors meet in camera, without management being in attendance,
as a standing agenda item for every Board meeting. Also, to further facilitate
open and candid discussion among its independent directors, and to facilitate
the Board's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out its
responsibilities, the Board is also continuing its long-standing policy of
encouraging the Corporation's independent directors to meet at any time they
consider necessary without any members of management or non-independent
directors being present. The Corporation's auditors, legal counsel and employees
may be invited to attend. The audit committee, which is composed of independent
directors, has a long-standing practice of meeting with the Corporation's
auditors in camera, without management being in attendance, as a standing agenda
item for every audit committee meeting. The independent directors exercise their
responsibilities for independent oversight of management through their position
of parity on the Board. 
The Board's non-executive Chairman, Mr. Brack, is considered an
independent director.

Board Mandate 
The Board has adopted a written mandate, a copy of which is
attached as Schedule "A" hereto. The role of the Board is to supervise
management and to approve major and strategic decisions. The Board relies on
management for periodic reports, and to provide the support and information
necessary to enable the Board to fulfil its obligations effectively. Major
matters are to be analysed in reports prepared by management and submitted to
the Board for its approval. All material transactions must be reviewed and
approved by the Board prior to implementation. Any responsibility that is not
delegated to senior management or a Board committee remains with the full Board.
One of the Board's responsibilities is to review and, if thought fit, to approve
opportunities as presented by management and to provide guidance to management.

The Board also meets to plan for the future growth of the
Corporation; identify risks of the Corporation's business, thus ensuring the
implementation of appropriate systems to manage these risks; monitor senior
management; and ensure timely disclosure of material transactions. Frequency of
Board meetings as well as the nature of agenda items change depending upon the
state of the Corporation's affairs and in light of opportunities or risks that
the Corporation faces. When necessary and appropriate, issues may be approved
and adopted by the Board by way of written resolutions. 
Position Descriptions 
The Board has not developed a written position description for
the Chairman of the Board, for the chairs of the committees of the Board or for
the Chief Executive Officer; the Board delineates the role and responsibilities
of these individuals through reference to industry norms and past practice and,
in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, also through reference to the terms
of his employment with the Corporation. 
Orientation and Continuing Education 
The Corporation does not provide formal continuing education to
its Board members, but encourages them to communicate with management, auditors
and technical consultants; to keep themselves current with industry trends and
developments and changes in legislation with management's assistance; and to
attend related industry seminars and visit the Corporation's properties. Board
members have full access to the Corporation's records. 
The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is responsible,
among other things, for determining appropriate orientation and education
programs for new Board members. While the Corporation does not have formal
orientation and training programs, new Board members are provided with: 


  
     
    1. 
    
      information respecting the functioning of the Board
      Directors, committees and copies of the Corporation's corporate governance
      policies;
  
     
     
     
  
     
    2. 
    
      access to recent, publicly filed documents of the
      Corporation;


- 19 - 


  
     
    3. 
    
      access to management, auditors, and technical
      consultants; and
  
     
     
     
  
     
    4. 
    
      further information and education as deemed appropriate
      and desirable by the Corporation's Corporate Governance Committee on a
      case-by-case basis.
Ethical Business Conduct 
The Board views good corporate governance as an integral
component to the success of the Corporation and to meet responsibilities to
Shareholders. The Board has adopted a written code of business conduct and
ethics (the "Code"), which may be viewed by visiting the Corporation's
web site at www.alexcoresource.com. The Board monitors compliance with the Code
by requesting that any person who becomes aware of any existing or potential
violation of the Code promptly notify the Chair of the Audit Committee or the
Corporation’s Ethics Officer. No material change report filed since the
beginning of the Corporation's most recently completed financial year pertains
to any conduct of a director or executive officer that constitutes a departure
from the Code. In addition, the Corporation requires that directors who have a
material interest declare that interest to the Board or committee thereof. The
Corporate Governance Committee is responsible (among other things) for
overseeing the procedure for monitoring directors' responsibility, diligence,
and for avoiding conflict of interest. 
Nomination of Directors 
The Corporation does not have a stand-alone nomination
committee, but the Corporate Governance Committee (all of the members of which
are considered independent under the tests prescribed by NI 52-110) is
responsible, among other things, for recommending candidates for nomination,
appointment, election and re-election to the Board and its committees, and for
annually assessing Board performance. The Corporate Governance Committee
assesses potential Board candidates to fill perceived needs on the Board for
required skills, expertise, independence and other factors. Members of the Board
and representatives of the financial services industry are consulted for
possible candidates. 
Procedure for Determining Compensation 
The members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Winn,
Searle and Brack, all of whom are considered independent under the tests
prescribed by NI 52-110. The Compensation Committee has responsibility for
recommending compensation for the directors and senior management, including the
granting of stock options to the Board, and for reviewing and ensuring that the
adequacy and form of compensation realistically reflects the responsibilities
and risks involved in being an effective officer or director. Additionally, the
mandate of the Compensation Committee includes the review of compensation of the
directors, and making recommendations as to changes that may be required. 
To determine compensation payable, the Compensation Committee
review(s) compensation paid for directors and officers of companies of similar
size and stage of development and determines an appropriate compensation
reflecting the need to provide incentive and compensation for the time and
effort expended by the directors and senior management while taking into account
the financial and other resources of the Corporation. 
Board Committees 
The Corporation has the following committees in addition to its
Audit and Compensation committees: 


  
     
    1. 
    
      the Corporate Governance Committee, which monitors the
      Corporation's corporate governance compliance; recommends corporate
      governance policy to the Board; reviews the procedure for monitoring
      directors' responsibility, diligence, and avoiding conflicts of interest;
      and reviews the Board's past years' proceedings to evaluate its efficiency
      and make require recommendations, if any; and


- 20 - 


  
     
    2. 
    
      the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee, which
      monitors compliance with environmental and safety standards and recommends
      environmental and safety policy to the Board.
All committees of the Corporation's Board are accountable to
the full Board. 
Assessments 
The Board, at such times as it deems appropriate, reviews the
performance and effectiveness of the Board, the directors and its committees to
determine whether changes in size, personnel or responsibilities are warranted.
To assist in its review, the Board conducts informal surveys of its directors,
receives reports from the Corporate Governance Committee on its assessment of
the functioning of the Board and reports from each committee respecting its own
effectiveness. As part of the assessments, the Board or the individual committee
may review their respective mandate or charter and conduct reviews of applicable
corporate policies.

committee is contained under the heading "Audit Committee Information" in the
