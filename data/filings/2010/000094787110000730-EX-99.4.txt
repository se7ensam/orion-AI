    Notes:
    *
Requirements for the approval of this proposal are as follows.
    Proposal
shall be adopted by a simple majority of the voting rights held by the
shareholders present and voting at the Meeting (including postal and electronic
voting) in a vote of shareholders holding in aggregate one-third (1/3) or more
of the total number of voting rights.
     
    
      (4)
Reason why a portion of the voting rights held by the shareholders present at
the Meeting was not added to the number of voting rights
       
    
    Because
the required majority approval for this proposal was met by the voting rights
exercised in advance on or before the day prior to the day of Meeting and the
voting rights of certain shareholders who attended the Meeting and whose
intention to approve or reject the proposal have been confirmed, and the
resolution was thereby enacted lawfully under the Company Law.
