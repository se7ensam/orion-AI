 seabed-to-surface February 17, 2010 slide 2 Forward-Looking Statements Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements may be identified by the use of
words like “anticipate,” “believe,”  “estimate,”
“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar  expressions. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are
subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are
discussed in our public filings and submissions  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results  and trends to
differ materially from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant  projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we
operate;  our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and
administrative proceedings or governmental  enquiries; uncertainties inherent in
operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the  timely
completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards,  including spills and environmental damage.  Many of these factors are beyond our ability to
control or predict.   Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on
the forward-looking statements.

 seabed-to-surface February 17, 2010 slide 25 Adjusted EBITDA (a)                 
     The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation,  depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other
gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and  amortisation and adjusted to exclude
investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA margin  from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing
operations.  Management believes that Adjusted  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our  business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been
prepared in accordance with International  Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the European Union.  These non-IFRS measures provide  management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as they eliminate the effects
of financing and depreciation.  Adjusted  EBITDA margin from continuing operations
may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by  shareholders and analysts following the Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the Group may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  Such supplementary adjustments to  EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the
US Securities and Exchange Commission (the  “SEC”) that apply to reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted  EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than
as presented in this release, or not be  presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS  and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as
determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of  the Group’s operating results
or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity.  The  reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from
continuing operations is included in this release.  This  release also includes a
supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net operating income from continuing  operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and
equipment and intangibles.  Management believes that this supplemental presentation
of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly  titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a
helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within  Acergy’s industry. 
Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above.  Adjusted EBITDA for total  operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.  Adjusted EBITDA:
