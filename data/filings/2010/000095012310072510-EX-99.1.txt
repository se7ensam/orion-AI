Agrium delivers second highest quarterly earnings; sees strengthening fundamentals



August 4, 2010 — ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$



CALGARY, Alberta — Agrium Inc. (TSX and NYSE: AGU) announced today its second highest quarterly
net earnings of $506-million ($3.20 diluted earnings per share) for the second quarter of 2010.



“Agrium delivered excellent second quarter results, the second highest in our history. This was
particularly impressive given the record level of un-seeded acreage in Western Canada and excessive
moisture conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt in late spring,” said Agrium President & CEO Mike Wilson.
“The second quarter started at a hectic pace, resulting in U.S. plantings being well ahead of
historical averages in April, however May and June saw excessive wet conditions across much of
North America, with seeding and application levels adversely impacted. Agrium’s significant
breadth and depth in our geographic and product offerings allowed us to offset these challenges and
provide excellent returns,” continued Mr. Wilson.



“Global grain prices have risen considerably over the past month, on concerns over drought
conditions in Europe and Russia and significantly lower acreage in Western Canada. Furthermore,
U.S. corn ending inventories have been revised downward twice so far this year. Strong
agricultural fundamentals should support the outlook for all crop inputs in the second half of
2010. Nitrogen and phosphate markets have also strengthened over the past month. We anticipate
North American crop nutrient demand to be strong in the second half at both the grower and retail
level, due to firming crop prices, weather induced constraints on nutrient application this spring,
an anticipated increase in U.S. corn acreage next year and the current low inventory level of crop
nutrients in the U.S. retail system. Agrium will continue to position itself strategically to
capture these robust fundamentals by growing all business units along the agricultural value chain.
In July 2010, we announced further retail growth in Argentina with the acquisition of 24 farm
centers and a chemical formulation plant in that country,” added Mr. Wilson.



The 2010 second quarter results included a pre-tax recovery of $57-million ($0.26 diluted earnings
per share)1 on stock-based compensation2 and pre-tax gains of $8-million
($0.04 diluted earnings per share)1 on natural gas and other hedge positions.



Consistent with our past practice, we intend to provide earnings guidance for the second half of
the year when we release our third quarter results.

    In comparison to second quarter guidance assumptions, actual stock-based compensation
recovery was $39-million ($0.18 diluted earnings per share) higher than assumed. In addition,
guidance assumptions excluded mark-to-market gains/losses on non-qualifying commodity hedge
positions.

     A reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings is provided in the section “Non-GAAP Measures”.






Our consolidated gross profit and EBIT for the second quarter and first half of 2010 both
increased versus the corresponding periods of 2009 primarily due to higher Retail crop nutrient
gross profit and Wholesale potash sales volumes. For discussion on the performance of each
business unit, see section “Business Segment Performance”.



Expenses were $16-million lower in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year
largely due to a $57-million increase in other income. This increase was primarily driven by a
recovery in stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $38-million increase in selling expense
primarily for Retail.



Expenses were $36-million higher in the first half of 2010 compared to the same period last year
largely due to a combination of the following items:







     
    •
     
    $48-million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for
Retail;



     

     
    •
     
    $20-million unfavourable change in potash profit taxes; and



     

     
    •
     
    $6-million decrease in earnings from equity investees.





These were partially offset by a $40-million reduction in other expenses, primarily driven by a
recovery in stock-based compensation.

There was no significant change in effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 compared
to the same period of 2009. The 4 percent decrease in the effective tax rate for the first half of
2010 versus the first half of 2009 was primarily due to the recognition of a previously
unrecognized tax benefit.



BUSINESS
SEGMENT PERFORMANCE



Retail



Retail’s 2010 second quarter net sales were $3.3-billion, which was 6 percent higher than the
$3.1-billion in the second quarter of 2009. Gross profit was $719-million in the second quarter of
2010, compared to $597-million for the same period last year. Retail EBIT was $360-million in the
second quarter of 2010, versus EBIT of $283-million in the second quarter of 2009. The 27 percent
improvement in the second quarter EBIT for Retail is due to increased farmer demand for
agricultural inputs resulting from a return to more normalized application levels by growers and
significantly higher crop nutrient margins. EBIT from Retail was the second highest on record and
could have been stronger if not for the extremely wet conditions experienced in the Corn Belt and
Western Canada during May and June.



Crop nutrients net sales reached $1.4-billion this quarter, $83-million higher than the same period
last year. The increase was primarily due to a 31 percent increase in crop nutrient sales volumes,
partly offset by lower nutrient prices. Gross profit was $252-million this quarter compared to
$117-million in the second quarter of 2009. Crop nutrient margins averaged 18 percent in the
second quarter of 2010, compared to 9 percent in the second quarter of 2009. The increase in
margins was due to a return to a more normal cost of inventory position in 2010 compared to the
previous year. Sales volumes and margin dollars in our South American operations were also
significantly higher than the second quarter last year due to a return to more normal moisture
conditions following the extreme drought in 2009. We anticipate strong North American sales
volumes in the second half of 2010 due to a solid fall application season as a result of
strengthening crop prices, a continued recovery in application rates after under-application of
nutrients over the past couple of years and the potential for an early harvest this year which
could lengthen the fall application season.1

Crop protection net sales were $1.2-billion in the second quarter of 2010, largely unchanged
from the same period last year. Gross profit was $274-million, down $30-million from the second
quarter of 2009. The gross profit decline was primarily due to competitive market conditions,
lower glyphosate prices, and pre-season fungicide sales at reduced prices. Crop protection
product margins as a percentage of net sales were 22 percent for the second quarter of 2010, as
compared to 25 percent for the same period last year.



Net sales of seed rose 11 percent to reach $588-million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase
in net sales was due to higher seeded acreage for cotton, soybean, and corn in 2010. Gross profit
for seed was $106-million, largely unchanged from the same quarter last year. Gross margin as a
percentage of net sales was 18 percent this quarter, versus 20 percent for the same period in 2009
due to a more competitive seed pricing environment between suppliers this year and lower supplier
prepay discounts than last year.



Application services and other net sales were $122-million for the second quarter of 2010, a
$23-million increase from the same period in 2009. Gross profit for the quarter increased to
$87-million, versus $72-million in 2009. This net sales and gross profit increase was due to higher
sales of applied nutrients and chemicals.



Retail selling expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were $304-million, an 11 percent increase
over last year’s level, primarily due to higher performance incentives and equipment expenses. The
incentives were related to higher earnings and the equipment expenses were consistent with the
increased application acres. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter of
2010 remained similar to the same period last year.



Wholesale



Wholesale EBIT for the quarter was $285-million, a 33 percent increase over the same period in
2009, and the second highest EBIT on record for this period. Wholesale’s net sales were $1-billion
for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $950-million for the second quarter of 2009. Gross
profit was $274-million in the second quarter of 2010, a $62-million increase from the second
quarter of 2009 and similar to the gross profit achieved in 2007. The key factors impacting these
strong results included the dramatic return in potash demand in both domestic and international
markets and higher purchase for resale sales margins and volumes which more than offset lower
nitrogen profit.



Nitrogen gross profit was $140-million this quarter, compared to $182-million in the same quarter
last year. Nitrogen realized sales prices were slightly lower in the second quarter of 2010 when
compared to 2009 due in part to lower realized ammonia prices and as a result of extremely wet
weather in our key Western Canadian market. Although benchmark ammonia prices were higher than the
same period last year, realized ammonia prices were lower as 2009 prices benefited from forward
sales made in late 2008 at relatively high prices. In addition, the wet weather in Western Canada
this spring resulted in a lower proportion of our second quarter ammonia sales to Western Canada.
Urea realized sales prices were slightly higher than the same quarter last year due to stronger
market fundamentals. Nitrogen sales volumes increased slightly when compared to the same period
last year, with higher ammonia and UAN sales volumes, offset partially by lower domestic and
international urea sales. Nitrogen cost of product sold was $243 per tonne this quarter versus
$227 per tonne last year. The higher cost of product sold per tonne in 2010 is primarily due to
higher natural gas costs in the



4




 






current year and the impact of repair and maintenance activities associated with our June Fort
Saskatchewan turnaround. Nitrogen margins averaged $111 per tonne this quarter, compared with $146
per tonne in the second quarter of last year. Ammonia margins were lower than the same quarter last
year while urea margins were similar to last year.



Overall natural gas cost was $4.69/MMBtu in the second quarter of 2010 versus $4.59/MMBtu in the
second quarter of 2009, including realized hedging losses of $20-million for the second quarter of
2010 (or $0.78/MMBtu). The U.S. benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the second quarter of 2010
was $4.07/MMBtu, versus $3.60/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $5.38/MMBtu in the first
quarter of 2010. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was a $0.29/MMBtu discount to NYMEX for the
second quarter of 2010.



Phosphate gross profit was $10-million, compared to $12-million for the same quarter last year.
Sales volumes were 7 percent lower than the same quarter last year due to record Western Canadian
crop land left un-seeded as a result of the extremely wet conditions this spring. Realized sales
prices averaged $510 per tonne this quarter, up 12 percent over the same period last year, due to
tight North American inventories resulting from improved demand in North America and globally.
Phosphate cost of product sold increased $61 per tonne to $469 per tonne compared to the second
quarter of 2009, due to higher rock and sulphur costs and the impact of repair and maintenance
activities associated with our June turnaround at our Conda plant. Conda’s 2009 turnaround was
executed in the third quarter. Gross margin for phosphate was $41 per tonne compared with $46 per
tonne in the second quarter of 2009.



Potash gross profit was $110-million versus $23-million in the second quarter of 2009. The
substantial increase in profit was due to the significant turnaround in demand in both domestic and
international markets in 2010, which more than offset lower sales prices this year. Sales volumes
were 529,000 tonnes this quarter, compared to only 61,000 tonnes for the same quarter last year.
The cost of product sold was $147 per tonne this quarter, down significantly from the $393 per
tonne in the second quarter of 2009. The reduction in per tonne costs was due to the Vanscoy mine
running at close to capacity for the second consecutive quarter in 2010. Gross margin on a per
tonne basis was $208 this quarter, down from the $377 in the second quarter of last year.



Purchase for resale gross profit for the second quarter of 2010 was $4-million, compared to a loss
of $28-million in the same period of 2009. Sales volumes increased to 759,000 tonnes from 681,000
tonnes in 2009 and average gross margin per tonne showed a significant improvement of $46 per tonne
from the previous year, since we did not carry high cost inventories in 2010 as was the case in
2009.



Wholesale expenses were $8-million lower in the second quarter of 2010 than for the same period
last year. The lower expenses were due primarily to lower potash profit and capital taxes and a
recovery in stock-based compensation. This was partly offset by an increase in year-over-year net
realized and mark-to-market derivative losses and a reduction in equity earnings from our 26
percent Egyptian investment due to a retroactive change in tax status. The Egyptian government
imposed a tax rate of 20 percent on earnings, resulting in a $7-million charge this quarter.



Advanced Technologies



Advanced Technologies’ second quarter 2010 net sales were $138-million compared to $82-million in
the second quarter of 2009. Gross profit of $31-million was $14-million higher versus the same
period last year. The increase in both net sales and gross profit was partly due to the transfer of
Agrium’s Retail turf and ornamental business in late 2009, which contributed $8-million of gross
profit in the current quarter. Environmentally Smart Nitrogen (“ESN”) sales were significantly
higher as well, contributing an additional $4-




5




 






million in gross profit when compared to the second
quarter of 2009. Both the turf and ornamental and agricultural product segments experienced
improved product demand and enhanced profitability versus 2009 as a result of the recovery in North
American spring nutrient applications.



EBITDA was $20-million, an increase of $8-million versus the comparable period in 2009. The
increase in EBITDA was driven by higher sales volumes and related gross profit, partially offset
by $6-million in increased selling costs in the period, related to the inclusion of the turf and
ornamental business transferred from Retail in 2009.



Other



EBIT for our Other non-operating business unit for the second quarter of 2010 was $72-million, an
increase of $35-million compared to $37-million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase was
primarily due to a recovery in stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower elimination of
gross profit. Although Retail sales of Wholesale products to external customers was greater in the
second quarter of 2010 versus the same period of 2009, the cost of the inventory was lower,
resulting in a lower elimination in the second quarter of 2010.



EBIT for Other for the first half of 2010 was a loss of $16-million, a decrease of $33-million
compared to earnings of $17-million for the same period of 2009. The decrease reflected the
deferral of gross profit on Wholesale products sold to Retail that have yet to be sold to external
customers and the expensing of costs related to the CF acquisition incurred in 2009. The decrease
in EBIT was partially offset by gains realized from the sale of 1.2 million CF shares (see
discussion under “Business Acquisition”) and a recovery in stock-based compensation driven by a
decrease in our share price during the first half of 2010.

The sources and uses of cash for the three months ended June 30, 2010 are summarized below:


Cash provided by operating activities — Drivers behind the $160-million decrease in source of cash






     
     
     





    Source of cash
     
    
•   $318-million increase resulting from net
earnings of $506-million adjusted for non-cash
items, primarily associated with future income
taxes and a recovery in stock-based compensation.


     
     
     


    Use of cash

     
    
•   $478-million increase in non-cash working
capital. The increase in non-cash working capital
was primarily driven by higher increase in accounts
receivable and lower decreases in both inventories
and prepaid expenses and deposits in the second
quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of
2009.





Cash used in financing activities — Drivers behind the $86-million increase in use of cash






     
     
     





    Use of cash

     
    
•   Higher bank indebtedness in Q2’09 due to
higher working capital needs for product purchases
in Q2’09 versus pay-down of bank indebtedness in
Q2’10.

The sources and uses of cash for the six months ended June 30, 2010 are summarized below:


Cash used in operating activities — Drivers behind the $343-million increase in use of cash






     
     
     





    Source of cash

     
    
•   $336-million increase resulting from net earnings of $499-million adjusted for
non-cash items, primarily associated with unrealized losses on both financial instruments
and foreign exchange and future income taxes.


     
     
     


    Use of cash

     
    
•   $679-million increase in non-cash working capital. The increase in non-cash
working capital was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, a higher increase in accounts receivable and a lower decrease in inventories
in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009. Partially offset by a higher
decrease in prepaid expenses and deposits in the first half of 2010 compared to the first
half of 2009.





Cash used in investing activities — Drivers behind the $191-million decrease in use of cash






     
     
     





    Source of cash

     
    
•   Proceeds of $117-million received on the sale of our shares in CF in Q1’10 that
were purchased for $65-million in Q1’09; and


     
     
     


     

     
    
•   Proceeds of $25-million received in Q1’10 on the sale of offshore insurance assets.


     
     
     


    Use of cash

     
    
•   $82-million increase in capital expenditures.





Cash provided by financing activities — Drivers behind the $140-million increase in source of cash






     
     
     





    Source of cash

     
    
•   Pay-down of our bank indebtedness due to lower working capital needs in the first
half of 2009 and removal of EAgrium bank indebtedness in Q1’09 a result of the
deconsolidation of EAgrium.





Our bank indebtedness is summarized as follows:

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, quarter-to-quarter
results are not directly comparable. Sales are concentrated in the spring and fall planting
seasons, while produced inventories are accumulated ahead of the application season. Cash
collections generally occur after the planting seasons in North and South America.



BUSINESS ACQUISITION


On March 11, 2010, the Company announced that it would no longer pursue an acquisition of CF
Industries Holdings Inc. (“CF”) and allowed its offer for CF to expire on March 22, 2010.
Acquisition costs of $45-million, previously recorded in prepaid expenses and deposits, were
expensed on expiry of the offer. In March 2010, the Company sold its investment in CF, consisting
of 1.2 million common shares, and recorded a pre-tax gain in other expenses of $52-million.
Unrealized gains on the shares had previously been recorded in other comprehensive income.


Following termination of the CF offer, the conditional sale of 50 percent of the Carseland nitrogen
facility to Terra Industries Inc. was also terminated.

Following below are the standards that may have significant impact on Agrium’s consolidated
financial statements. This is not an exhaustive listing of changes on transition to IFRS. Detailed
analysis and quantification of these changes is continuing and approval of accounting policies is
expected in 2010. Agrium does not expect a significant impact to its business activities nor to its
operating cash flows from the transition to IFRS.






     
     
     


    Significant Differences Between IFRS and Canadian GAAP
     
    Estimated Impact





    Employee Benefits 
Agrium expects to use an optional exemption to recognize
all cumulative actuarial gains and losses through its
opening retained earnings on transition date.

     
    
Transition date impact: reduction
of shareholders’ equity and an
increase in pension liabilities by
the unrecognized actuarial gains
and losses as at transition date


     
     
     


     

     
    Future impact: not significant


     
     
     


    Share-based payments
IFRS requires cash-settled, share-based awards to be
measured at fair value, while Canadian GAAP allows these
awards to be measured at intrinsic value. In addition,
Agrium currently uses straight line depreciation to
recognize graded vesting stock based instruments, while
IFRS requires that each installment be accounted for as a
separate arrangement.

     
    
Transition date: reduction in
shareholders’ equity and an
increase in liabilities


Future impact: a continued
measurement difference between the
intrinsic value and the fair value
of share based awards


     
     
     


    Income Taxes
Classification of future income taxes under IFRS is
non-current whereas Canadian GAAP splits future income
taxes between current and non-current components.

     
    

Transition date: reclassifying all
future income taxes to non-current
is expected to result in a decrease
in current assets and a decrease in non-current income tax liabilities


     

     
    

Future impact: remains a
classification difference


     
     
     


    IFRS requires recognition of the deferred tax impact for
temporary differences arising on translation of certain
non-monetary assets or liabilities. Canadian GAAP does
not allow similar treatment.

     
    Transition date: Increase in deferred tax
liabilities and a corresponding
decrease in retained earnings


     
     
     


     

     
    Future impact: analysis is ongoing


     
     
     


    Foreign Exchange
Agrium expects to use an optional exemption that permits
a first time adopter to not comply with the requirements
for cumulative translation differences that existed at
the date of transition to IFRS. If this exemption is
elected Agrium is permitted to deem all cumulative
translation differences for all foreign operations to be
nil at transition.

     
    
Transition date: reclassification
from accumulated other
comprehensive income to retained
earnings; no impact to
shareholders’ equity


Future impact: none


     
     
     


    Provisions
IFRS requires discounting of provisions where the effect
of the discounting is material. Provisions are not
discounted under Canadian GAAP unless specifically
required or when a provision is required to be measured
at fair value. 


The specific provisions for asset retirement obligations
under IFRS are

     
    
Transition date: decrease in
environmental liabilities and a
corresponding increase to retained
earnings


Future impact: each period there
will be a charge to earnings for
accretion of discount

    measured based on management’s best
estimate. The discount rate used in calculating the
present value of the cash flow estimates is to be based
on risks specific to the liability unless these risks
have been incorporated into the cash flow estimates.
Canadian GAAP measures asset retirement obligations at

decrease to retained earnings


Future impact: decrease in charge

    Decommissioning Liabilities
Agrium expects to use an optional exemption to measure
any decommissioning liabilities and the related
depreciation effects at the date of transition to IFRS.

     
     Transition date: increase to the
asset base to which the
decommissioning liabilities relate,
offset to retained earnings


     
     
     


     

     
    Future impact: increased asset base
will result in higher charges to
earnings for depreciation over
remaining useful life of assets






NON-GAAP MEASURES



In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary measures of
earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net earnings before interest expense
and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation,
amortization and asset impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of
performance because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of historical performance
for the different business segments. Similarly, financing and related interest charges cannot be
allocated to all business units on a basis that is meaningful for comparison with other companies.



EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of calculation may not be
comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should not be used as an alternative to cash
provided by (used in) operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.



The following table is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net loss as calculated in accordance
with GAAP:

BUSINESS RISKS



The information presented on enterprise risk management and business risks on pages 81 — 88 in our
2009 Annual Report has not changed materially since December 31, 2009.



CONTROLS & PROCEDURES



There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended June 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.



OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES



Following several consecutive years of favourable growing conditions in most major global
regions, there have been numerous crop production concerns in recent months. Russia and Europe are
experiencing a drought resulting in analysts projecting a significant decline in crop production in
this region. In contrast, extremely wet weather reduced seeded acreage and production in Western
Canada. Though it is early in the 2010/11 marketing year, the USDA is already projecting that
global grain ending stocks will decline. All of these factors have been supportive to grain and
oilseed markets in recent weeks.



Indications are that the U.S. harvest is expected to be early this year as the corn development is
ahead of normal due to an early planting and generally favorable crop progress. An early U.S.
harvest should be favourable for all crop input applications, in particular for fall crop nutrient
demand due to the potential for an extended fall application season. Furthermore, the USDA reduced
its forecasts of carry-in stocks and acreage for the 2010/11
marketing year which reduced projected 2010/11 U.S. corn ending stocks by 13 percent. Analysts
expect this reduction to result in an increase in corn area in 2011.



The crop protection and seed markets both experienced greater competitive pressures in the first
half of 2010 than the past few years. The global glyphosate market has stabilized, while other
crop protection products are expected to demonstrate an improvement in market conditions in the
second half of 2010 and into 2011. Similarly, seed prices are expected to trend higher over the
next year, although prices are likely to rise at a slower rate than was the case in the 2005-2008
period.



Global nitrogen markets have firmed considerably due to a combination of seasonal turnarounds in
some export regions reducing supply and a significant increase in demand from markets such as
India, Pakistan and Brazil. In North America, nitrogen supplies remain historically tight with
urea inventories 11 percent below the five-year average at the end of June. China is in the midst
of its seasonal reduction of the urea export tax to 7

14




 





percent which may act as a cap on the present
market rally, although recent strength in the Chinese domestic market is leading to increases in
Chinese export prices. The delayed Pardis 2 urea plant in Iran is expected to come on-stream in
the third quarter. There is still uncertainty over the price Ukrainian producers will pay for
natural gas in the second half of 2010. While most analysts expect the price will rise, the timing
and extent of the increase is still uncertain.



North American DAP/MAP inventories in June rose 17 percent, the highest level since May of 2009 as
reported by the TFI. However, international phosphate markets have firmed in recent weeks on
strong global demand. Import demand from India is expected to keep exporters in a relatively
comfortable position for much of the rest of the year. In addition, strong crop prices should be
supportive to seasonal South American demand over the next several months and from North America
later in 2010. Phosphate prices will also continue to be influenced by freight rates. The recent
significant decline in dry bulk freight rates has been supportive to FOB phosphate prices. Ma’aden,
in Saudi Arabia, announced that it has begun trial operations at its phosphate mine and plant. The
timing of product being commercially available is uncertain, but most analysts expect it will be
mid-2011 before there is a significant volume.



The potash market continues to recover from the low demand levels experienced in 2009. North
American producer inventories as reported by the TFI show that North American potash inventory
levels at the end of June were 34 percent lower than year-ago levels. While global demand is
significantly higher than it was a year ago, it remains behind historical averages in some key
regions. For example, in the first six months of 2010, Brazilian imports of potash were more than
three times the comparable period of 2009, but remained about 10 percent below the 2004-2008
average. Reports indicate that Brazilian potash supplies are tight and second half 2010 imports
could be significantly stronger than they were in the first half. Chinese potash imports through
the end of June totaled 2.5 million tonnes relative to 1.7 million tonnes in the same period of
2009. There remains uncertainty about Chinese imports during the second half of the year, but
recent flooding is reported to have reduced domestic production capabilities, potentially creating
the need for increased imports.

AGRIUM INC.
Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the six months ended June 30, 2010
(Millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)
(Unaudited)



1.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


The Company’s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in Canada and are consistent with those outlined in the annual audited financial
statements except where stated below. These interim consolidated financial statements do not
include all disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements and should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2009. In management’s opinion, the interim consolidated financial statements include
all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information. The Company has evaluated events
subsequent to the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Sales are concentrated in the spring and
fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are accumulated ahead of the application season.
Cash collections generally occur after the planting seasons in North and South America.

Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.


2.     BUSINESS ACQUISITION



CF Industries Holdings, Inc.


On March 11, 2010, the Company announced that it would no longer pursue an acquisition of CF
Industries Holdings, Inc. (“CF”) and allowed its offer for CF to expire on March 22, 2010.
Acquisition costs of $45-million, previously recorded in prepaid expenses and deposits, were
expensed on expiry of the offer. In March 2010, the Company sold its investment in CF, consisting
of 1.2 million common shares, and recorded a pre-tax gain in other expenses of $52-million.
Unrealized gains on the shares had previously been recorded in other comprehensive income.

10.     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



Risk management


In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash
flows are exposed to various risks. On an annual basis, the Board approves a strategic plan that
takes into account the opportunities and major risks of the Company’s business and mitigation
factors to reduce these risks. The Board also reviews risk management policies and procedures on an
annual basis and sets upper limits on the transactional exposure to be managed and the time periods
over which exposures may be managed. The Company manages risk in accordance with its Exposure
Management Policy. The objective of the policy is to reduce volatility in cash flow.

Sensitivity analysis to risk is provided where the effect on net earnings or shareholders’ equity
could be material. Sensitivity analysis is performed by relating the reasonably possible changes in
the risk variable at June 30, 2010 to financial instruments outstanding on that date while assuming
all other variables remain constant.


Market risk







    (a)
     
    Currency risk




U.S. dollar denominated transactions in our Canadian operations generate foreign exchange gains and
losses on outstanding balances which are recognized in net earnings. The net U.S. dollar
denominated balance in Canadian operations is $305-million. A $10-million impact on net earnings
requires a strengthening or weakening of $0.05 in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar.

    Balances in non-U.S. dollar subsidiaries (in U.S. dollar equivalent)

    Accounts payable and accrued liabilities
     
     
    (321
    )
     
     
    (30

    (32
    )


     
     
         
     
     
         
     





A foreign currency translation adjustment is recognized in other comprehensive income upon
translation of our Canadian and European operations to U.S. dollars. A $10-million increase in
comprehensive income requires a strengthening of $0.05 of the Canadian dollar or a weakening of
$0.38 of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. A $10-million decrease in comprehensive income requires
a weakening of $0.05 of the Canadian dollar or a strengthening of $0.20 of the Euro against the
U.S. dollar.






    (b)
     
    Commodity price risk




For natural gas derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2010, a $10-million
increase in net earnings requires an increase of $3.70 per MMBtu. During the quarter, the Company
entered into natural gas derivative financial instruments to offset the exposure on the majority of
its outstanding natural gas derivative financial instruments.

    (c)
     
    Interest rate risk




The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a term of three
months or less that earn interest at market rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk on
these investments by maximizing the interest income earned on excess funds while maintaining the
liquidity necessary to conduct operations on a day-to-day basis. Fluctuations in market rates of
interest on cash and cash equivalents do not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of
operations due to the short term to maturity of the investments.


Credit risk


There were no significant uncollectible trade receivable balances at June 30, 2010.

The Company may be exposed to certain losses in the event that counterparties to short-term
investments and derivative financial instruments are unable to meet their contractual obligations.
The Company manages this counterparty credit risk with policies requiring that counterparties to
short-term investments and derivative financial instruments have an investment grade or higher
credit rating and policies that limit the investing of excess funds to liquid instruments with a
maximum term of one year and limit the maximum exposure to any one counterparty. The Company also
enters into master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to counterparty credit risk. At
June 30, 2010, all counterparties to derivative financial instruments have maintained an investment
grade or higher credit rating and there is no indication that any counterparty will be unable to
meet their obligations under derivative contracts.

11.     CAPITAL MANAGEMENT


The Company’s primary objectives when managing capital are to provide for: (a) an appropriate
rate of return to shareholders in relation to the risks underlying the Company’s assets; and, (b) a
prudent capital structure for raising capital at a reasonable cost for the funding of ongoing
operations, capital expenditures, and new growth initiatives.

The ratios outlined in the table below are monitored by the Company in managing its capital.

    (a)
     
    Net debt includes bank indebtedness and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents.
Equity consists of shareholders’ equity.


 


    (b)
     
    Interest coverage is the last twelve months net earnings before interest expense, income
taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset impairment divided by interest, which includes
interest on long-term debt plus other interest.


 


    (c)
     
    The measures of debt and net earnings described above are non-GAAP financial measures which
do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.


 


    (d)
     
    The Company’s strategy for managing capital is unchanged from December 31, 2009.





The Company’s revolving credit facilities require that the Company maintain specific interest
coverage and debt to capital ratios as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in the debt
agreements. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2010.
