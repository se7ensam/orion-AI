  OVERVIEW AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE
  Alberta Star Development Corp. is a Canadian Mineral Exploration Company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of exploration properties in Canada s Northwest Territories ( NT ). These properties are in the exploration stage. The Company does not generate income or cash flow from its operations. The Company s outlook is dependent on the global demand for the minerals that it is seeking on its properties, namely base and precious metals, including gold, silver, copper, cobalt, lead, zinc and uranium.
  The Company delayed its 2009 exploration program due to unfavourable market conditions and high field costs related to working in the Northwest Territories. During the Summer of 2009, the Company demobilized its exploration camp at Echo Bay, NT. The Company intends to monitor and provide updates on its future exploration programs as market conditions change. The Company continues to reduce its overhead and look for additional avenues to conserve its working capital with the intent of acquiring an economic mineral deposit. The Company has a strong balance sheet, no debt, is focused on cost cutting and maintaining qualified management. The Company continues its search to acquire and develop a world class advanced stage exploration and production project. As a result of the uncertainty in the ongoing global economic crisis, the Company expects there to be a notable reduction in capital available to the resource industry for a number of years to come, and the Company intends to m
anage its cash resources and review opportunities as the economic circumstances demand. The Company has and continues to conduct due diligence reviews on a number of resource opportunities, including a number of advanced stage mineral exploration projects that meet the Company s corporate mandate of acquiring opportunities with established resources, expansion potential, infrastructure, cash flow and near term cash flow.
  To this end, on June 10, 2009, the Company filed a Notice of Appearance and Request for Special Notice with the United States Bankruptcy court for the District of Idaho regarding the Sterling Mining Company ( Sterling ) and its corporate assets situated in the Coeur d Alene, Idaho mining district.
  On April 21, 2010, the Company announced that it was unsuccessful in its bid to acquire 100% of the shares of Sterling and the Sunshine Mine Lease pursuant to a bankruptcy auction held on April 21, 2010. As a result of the unsuccessful bid, the Company has confirmed that certain conditions contained in the Acquisition Agreement (the Agreement ) with Sterling dated November 17, 2009 have not been satisfied in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. As a result of the unsatisfied conditions, the Company will pursue a compensation fee of US$250,000 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the Second Amended Plan and Disclosure Statement filed by Sterling.
  On March 11, 2010, the Company consolidated its share capital on a ratio of a one (1) new common share without par value for every five (5) existing common shares without par value basis. The Company has concluded that the consolidation is in the best interest of the shareholders as it could lead to increased interest by a wider audience of potential investors and would better position the Company to obtain financing and pursue acquisition opportunities.
  The Company maintains a strong balance sheet and has no long term debt. The Company continues to maintain seasoned and qualified management and seeks to fulfill its stated mandate of acquiring a world class advanced stage exploration and production project.
  The Company s shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol ASX , on the OTCBB under the symbol ASXSF and on the Frankfurt Exchange under the symbol QLD .
  As at May 31, 2010, the Company had working capital of $12,065,308, inclusive of $13,500,895 of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Cash and cash equivalents on hand at the date of this MD&A are approximately $13,300,000 which is sufficient to cover additional property acquisitions, planned exploration expenditures, and administration for at least 12 months.

  The Eldorado South claims cover a radiometric anomaly that is over 3.5 kilometers in length and the expression suggests a potential near surface IOCG & uranium target. The radiometric maps show a well defined uranium anomaly with a marked correlation of strong thorium (Th) and potassium (k) ratio patterns. The Eldorado South Anomaly has never been drill tested. The Eldorado South Anomaly was discovered as a result of the completion of a High Resolution, Multi-Parameter Regional radiometric and magnetic geophysical survey which was conducted in July 2006. The survey consisted of 16,708 line-kilometers at 100 meter line-spacing s. The purpose of the radiometric survey was to measure the gamma radiation field and locate prospective areas of high-grade uranium and poly-metallic deposition.
  Expenditures related to the Eldorado South IOCG & Uranium Mineral Claims for the period ended May 31, 2010 consist of claim maintenance and permitting of $Nil (2009 - $10,762), geology and engineering of $Nil (2009 - $57,743), staking and line cutting of $Nil (2009 - $71,500), and wages, consulting and management fees of $Nil (2009 - $48,942).
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2010
  The Company s net loss for the six month period ended May 31, 2010 was $1,129,042 or $0.05 per share compared to a net loss of $1,385,209 or $0.06 per share for the six month period ended May 31, 2009. The significant changes during the current fiscal period compared to the same period a year prior are as follows:
  Included in general and administrative costs are consulting fees of $129,938 of which $104,938 was paid to various consultants engaged in the evaluation of potential mineral projects and $25,000 was paid for services relating to the annual general meeting.
  Advertising and promotion expenses increased to $18,858 during the six month period ended May 31, 2010 from the $9,483 during the same period a year prior. The increase in advertising and promotion is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising costs and news release dissemination.
  Salaries and benefits for the six month period ended May 31, 2010 were $270,302 as compared to $249,850 for the six month period ended May 31, 2009.
  Stock-based compensation expense totalling $22,890, a non-cash item, was incurred during the six month period ended May 31, 2010 for previously granted stock options that vested during the period as compared to $40,411 for the six month period ended May 31, 2009. No stock options were granted during the six month period ended May 31, 2010.
  Transfer fees and shareholder information costs increased to $153,803 for the six month period ended May 31, 2010 from $141,889 for the six month period ended May 31, 2009. The increase in transfer fees and shareholder information costs period over period is due mainly as a result of retaining Progressive IR consultants Corp. as its investor relations and corporate communications service provider. Progressive has been retained for a period of one year, and will be responsible for the dissemination of corporate data packages, broker presentation, broker communication, mining analyst communication, attending trade shows and handling all shareholder enquiries regarding the Company. Progressive receives $7,500 per month and was granted options to acquire 100,000 shares in the capital of the Company at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.
  Legal and accounting costs were $115,079 for the six month period ended May 31, 2010 primarily due to the unsuccessful bid to acquire the shares of the Sterling Mining Company but the Company is pursuing a compensation fee of US$250,000 to offset this cost.
  Interest income decreased to $23,124 for the six month period ended May 31, 2010, compared to $99,434 during the same period a year prior primarily due to the Company earning lower interest rates on short term investments during the current period.

  On 21 April 2010, the Company announced that it was unsuccessful in its bid to acquire 100% of the shares of Sterling and the Sunshine Mine Lease pursuant to a bankruptcy auction held on 21 April 2010. As a result of the unsuccessful bid, the Company has confirmed that certain conditions contained in the Agreement with Sterling dated 17 November 2009 have not been satisfied. As a result of the unsatisfied conditions, the Company will pursue a compensation fee of US$250,000 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the Second Amended Plan and Disclosure Statement filed by Sterling.
  As of the date of this report the Company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $13,300,000. The Company believes that this is sufficient to fund its currently planned exploration and administrative budget through the balance of fiscal 2010.
  CONTINGENCIES
  The Company is aware of no contingencies or pending legal proceedings as of July 23, 2010.
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that would require disclosure.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
  The preparation of the Company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities.
  Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the determination of impairment of equipment, environmental and reclamation obligations, rates for amortization and variables used in determining stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on management s best judgment. Factors that could affect these estimates include risks inherent in mineral exploration and development, changes in reclamation requirements, changes in government policy and changes in foreign exchange rates.
  Management has assessed the carrying value of its assets and does not believe the remaining assets have suffered any impairment.
  The Company does not believe it has incurred any material environmental liabilities to date. The Company has the responsibility to perform reclamation in certain jurisdictions upon completion of drilling. The costs to complete this reclamation are immaterial and are expensed when incurred.
  Management has made significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair market value of stock-based compensation granted to employees and non-employees and the value attributed to various warrants and broker warrants issued on financings. These estimates have an effect on the stock-based compensation expense recognized and the contributed surplus and share capital balances on the Company s balance sheet. Management has made estimates of the life of stock options and warrants, the expected volatility and expected dividend yields that could materially affect the fair market value of these types of securities. The estimates were chosen after reviewing the historical life of the Company s options and analyzing share price history to determine volatility.

  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
  Effective 1 December 2008, the Company adopted CICA Handbook Section 3064, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The new requirements of Section 3064 are for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. Section 3064 replaces Section 3062, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The new standard establishes revised standards for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of goodwill and intangible assets. The new standard also provides guidance for the treatment of preproduction and start-up costs and requires that these costs be expensed as incurred.
  Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
  On 20 January 2009, the Emerging Issues Committee ( EIC ) of the AcSB issued EIC Abstract 173, Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which establishes that an entity s own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparty should be taken into account in determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivative instruments. EIC 173 should be applied retrospectively without restatement of prior years to all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in interim and annual financial statements for periods ending on or after 20 January 2009.
  Mining Exploration Costs
  On 27 March 2009, the EIC of the AcSB issued EIC Abstract 174, Mining Exploration Costs , which provides guidance on capitalization of exploration costs related to mining properties. It also provides guidance for development and exploration stage entities that cannot estimate future cash flows from its properties in assessing whether impairment in such properties is required. EIC 174 is to be applied retrospectively without restatement of prior periods in interim and annual financial statements for periods ending on or after 27 March 2009.
  In 2001, the CICA issued Accounting Guideline No. 11, which covers the Company s exploration activities. In the past, the Company has capitalized certain exploration costs on mineral properties that were not covered by feasibility studies, whereas under the new guideline, the Company was required to expense these amounts in the year incurred. Effective 1 January 2001, the Company adopted these new recommendations on a retroactive basis. The impact as at 1 January 2001 of the adoption of these new recommendations was to reduce mineral properties by $561,257 and to increase deficit, accumulated during the exploration stage by $561,257.
  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
  Business Combinations
  In January 2009, the CICA issued Handbook Section 1582, Business Combinations , which replaces Section 1581, Business Combinations , and provides the equivalent to IFRS 3, Business Combinations (January 2008). The new Section expands the definition of a business subject to an acquisition and establishes significant new guidance on the measurement of consideration given, and the recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
  10





  The new Section requires that all business acquisitions be measured at the full fair value of the acquired entity at the acquisition date even if the business combination is achieved in stages, or if less than 100 percent of the equity interest in the acquiree is owned at the acquisition date. The measurement of equity consideration given in a business combination will no longer be based on the average of the fair value of the shares a few days before and after the day the terms and conditions have been agreed to and the acquisition announced, but rather at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability will be recognized in earnings and not as an adjustment to the purchase price.
  Restructuring and other direct costs of a business combination are no longer considered part of the acquisition accounting. Instead, such costs will be expensed as incurred, unless they constitute the costs associated with issuing debt or equity securities.
  The Section applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2011. Earlier adoption is permitted.
  Consolidated Financial Statements and Non-Controlling Interests
  In January 2009, the CICA issued Handbook Section 1601, Consolidated Financial Statements and Section 1602, Non-Controlling Interests , which together replace Section 1600, Consolidated Financial Statements . These two Sections are the equivalent to the corresponding provisions of International Accounting Standard 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (January 2008). Section 1602 applies to the accounting for non-controlling interests and transactions with non-controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements. The new Sections require that, for each business combination, the acquirer measure any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest s proportionate share of the acquiree s identifiable net assets. The new Sections also require non-controlling interest to be presented as a separate component of shareholders equity.
  Under Section 1602, non-controlling interest in income is not deducted in arriving at consolidated net income or other comprehensive income. Rather, net income and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to the controlling and non-controlling interests based on relative ownership interests. These Sections apply to interim and annual consolidated financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011, and should be adopted concurrently with Section 1582.
  International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS )
  In January 2006, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board adopted a strategic plan, which includes the decision to move financial reporting for Canadian publicly accountable enterprises to a single set of globally accepted standards, IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The effective implementation date of the conversion from Canadian generally accepted accounting principles ( Canadian GAAP ) to IFRS is 1 January 2011, with an effective transition date of 1 January 2010 for financial statements prepared on a comparative basis. The Company is engaged in an assessment and conversion process and expects to be ready for the conversion to IFRS in advance of 1 January 2011.
  The Company s approach to the conversion to IFRS includes three phases.
  11





  
    
      Phase one, an initial general diagnostic of its accounting policies and Canadian GAAP relevant to its financial reporting requirements to determine the key differences and options with respect to acceptable accounting standards under IFRS. This phase was completed in late 2009.
    
      Phase two, an in-depth analysis of the IFRS impact in those areas identified under phase one. This phase commenced in 2010. A summary of this analysis is provided in Table 1 below.
    
      Phase three, the implementation of the conversion process, including the completion of the opening balance sheet as at 1 December 2010 together with related discussion and notes, will be carried out in the second half of 2010.
    
  
  At this point, the Company s IT accounting and financial reporting systems are not expected to be significantly impacted. Further, the Company has in place internal and disclosure control procedures to ensure continued effectiveness during this transition period.
  The above comments, including the summary in Table 1, should not be considered as a complete and final list of the changes that will result from the transition to IFRS as the Company intends to maintain a current and proactive approach based on changes in circumstances and no final determinations have been made. In addition, the accounting bodies responsible for issuing Canadian and IFRS accounting standards have significant ongoing projects that could impact the Company s financial statements as at 1 January 2011 and in subsequent years, including projects regarding financial instruments and joint venture accounting. In addition, there is an extractive industries project currently underway that will lead to more definitive guidance on the accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditures, although this is still in the discussion paper stage and may not be completed for some time. The Company is continuing to monitor the development of these projects and will assess thei
r impact in the course of its transition process to IFRS.

  Table 1. Summary of financial statements impact on transition from Canadian GAAP to IFRS.
  
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        Key Area 
        Canadian GAAP (as currently applied) 
        IFRS 
        Analysis and preliminary conclusions 
      
      
        Property, plant and equipment (PP&E ) 
        PP&E is recorded at historical cost. 
        PP&E can be recorded using the cost (on transition to IFRS, the then fair value can be deemed to be the cost) or revaluation models. 
        PP&E will likely continue to be recorded at their historical costs due to the complexity and resources required to determine fair values on
          an annual basis. 
      
      
         
           
         
         
      
      
         
        Depreciation is based on their useful lives after due estimation of their residual values. 
        Depreciation must be based on the useful lives of each significant component within PP&E. 
        Based on an analysis of PP&E and its significant components, the Company has determined that no change to their useful lives is warranted and, therefore, depreciation expense will continue to be calculated using the same rates under IFRS. 
      
      
            
         
           
         
      
      
        Mineral properties 
        Exploration, evaluation and development costs are expensed when incurred. 
        IFRS has limited guidance with respect to these costs
          and currently allows exploration and evaluation costs to be either capitalized or expensed. 
        The existing accounting policy is likely to be maintained. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
        Asset retirement obligations ( ARO ) 
        Canadian GAAP limits the definition of ARO to legal obligations. 
        IFRS defines ARO as legal or constructive obligations. 
        The broadening of this definition is unlikely to cause a significant change in the Company s current estimates. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
         
        ARO is calculated using a current credit-adjusted,
          risk-free rate for upward adjustments, and the
          original credit-adjusted, risk-free rate for downward revisions. The original liability is not adjusted for changes in current discount rates. 
        ARO is calculated using a current pre-tax discount rate (which reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the
          liability) and is revised every reporting period to
          reflect changes in assumptions or discount rates. 
        The Company is in the final stages of quantifying the impact of this change
          on the ARO provision. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
         
         
        IFRS requires that, on transition, the net book value of the asset related to ARO be adjusted on the basis of the ARO balance existing at inception.
        The Company expects to rely on the IFRS 1 exemption which allows a company to use current estimates of future reclamation costs and current
          amortization rates to determine the net book value on transition to IFRS. 
      
      
        
      
    
  
  
  13




  
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        Impairment of long lived assets 
        Impairment tests of its long-term assets are considered annually based on indications of impairment. 
        Impairment tests of cash generating units are considered annually in the presence of indications of impairment. 
        Assets will continue to be grouped under the Company s various mining operations. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
         
        Impairment tests are generally done on the basis of undiscounted future cash flows. 
        Impairment tests are generally carried out using the discounted future cash flows. 
        Impairment tests using discounted values could generate a greater likelihood of write downs in the future. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
         
        Write-downs to net realizable values under an impairment test are permanent changes in the carrying value of assets. 
        Write downs to net realizable values under an impairment test can be reversed if the conditions of impairment cease to exist. 
        Potential significant volatility in earnings could arise as a result of the difference in the treatment of write-downs. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
        Stock-based compensation 
        Stock-based compensation is determined using fair value models (e.g. Black-Scholes) for equity-settled awards and the intrinsic model for cash-settled awards. 
        Stock-based compensation is determined using fair value models for all awards. However, upon settlement, cash-settled awards are adjusted to the value actually realized (intrinsic model). 
        The utilization of fair value models for cash-settled awards will change the estimate of the related liability while the awards remain outstanding and create greater volatility in earnings until the awards are settled. 
      
      
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
         
        The Company recognizes stock-based compensation on straight line method and updates the value of the options for forfeitures as they occur. 
        Under IFRS, stock-based compensation is amortized under the graded method only. In addition, the Company is required to update its value of options for each reporting period for expected forfeitures. 
        The Company expects to record an IFRS income statement and balance sheet adjustment at 1 December 2010. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
        Income taxes 
        There is no exemption from recognizing a deferred income tax for the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
          transaction that is not a business combination. The carrying amount of the asset or liability acquired is adjusted for the amount of the deferred income tax recognized. 
        A deferred income tax is not recognized if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. 
        The Company does not expect the difference in recognition of deferred income tax to have any significant change in the future. 
      
      
         
         
         
         
      
      
         
        All deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. 
        A deferred tax asset is recognized if it is probable that it will be realized. 
        Probable in this context is not defined and does not necessarily mean more likely than not. The Company is in the final stages of quantifying the impact of this difference. 
      
    
  
  
  The above assessment and conclusions are based on the analysis completed by the Company as of the date of this report and may be subject to change between now and 1 January 2011.

  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS
  Fair value - The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
  Exchange risk - The Company operates solely in Canada and therefore is subject to minimal foreign currency risk arising from changes in exchange rates with other currencies.
  Interest rate risk - The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short-term investments, but this risk relates only to investments held to fund future activities and does not affect the Company s current operating activities.
  Credit risk - The Company places its temporary investment funds with government and bank debt securities and is subject to minimal credit risk with regard to temporary investments.
  The Company does not have any risk associated with other instruments ; that is, instruments that may be settled by the delivery of non-financial assets.
  RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
  The Company believes that the following items represent significant areas for consideration.
  Cash Flows and Additional Funding Requirements
  The Company has limited financial resources, no sources of operating cash flows and no assurances that sufficient funding, including adequate financing, will be available. If the Company s exploration programs are successful, additional funds will be required in order to complete the development of its properties. The sources of funds currently available to the Company include; raising equity or debt capital, or offering an interest in its projects to another party. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising sufficient funds to conduct further exploration and development of its projects or to fulfill its obligations under the terms of any option or joint venture agreements, in which case the Company may have to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development, or forfeit its interest in its properties or prospects.
  Industry
  The Company is engaged in the exploration of mineral properties, an inherently risky business. There is no assurance that funds spent on the exploration and development of a mineral deposit will result in the discovery of an economic ore body. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits.
  Commodity Prices
  The profitability of the Company s operations will be dependent upon the market price of mineral commodities. Mineral prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company. The prices of mineral commodities have fluctuated widely in recent years. Current and future price declines could cause commercial production to be impracticable. The Company s revenues and earnings also could be affected by the prices of other commodities such as fuel and other consumable items, although to a lesser extent than by the price of mineral commodities.
  15





  Competition
  The mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases, and the Company competes with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than itself with respect to the discovery and acquisition of interests in mineral properties, the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and other persons to carry out its mineral exploration activities. Competition in the mining industry could adversely affect the Company s prospects for mineral exploration in the future.
  Government Laws, Regulation & Permitting
  Mining and exploration activities of the Company are subject to domestic laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, production, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, mine safety, waste disposal, toxic substances, the environment and other matters. Although the Company believes that all exploration activities are currently carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations, no assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing the operations and activities of the Company or more stringent implementation thereof could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company.
  The operations of the Company will require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities to carry out exploration and development at its projects. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary licences and permits on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. Any failure to comply with permits and applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption or closure of operations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities.
  Title to Properties
  Acquisition of rights to the mineral properties is a very detailed and time-consuming process. Title to, and the area of, mineral properties may be disputed. To the best of the Company s knowledge, the Company has title to all of the properties for which it holds mineral leases or licenses or in respect of which it has a right to earn an interest, however, the Company cannot give an assurance that title to such properties will not be challenged or impugned.
  The Company has the right to earn an increased interest in some of its properties. To earn this increased interest in each property, the Company is required to make certain cash payments. If the Company fails to make these payments, the Company may lose its right to such properties and forfeit any funds expended to such time.
  Estimates of Mineral Resources
  The mineral resource estimates used by the Company are estimates only and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery of minerals will in fact be realized or that an identified resource will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) deposit which can be legally or commercially exploited. In addition, the grade of mineralization ultimately mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results and such differences could be material.
  Key Management
  The success of the Company will be largely dependent upon the performance of its key officers, consultants and employees. Locating mineral deposits depends on a number of factors, not the least of which is the technical skill of the exploration personnel involved. The success of the Company is largely dependent on the performance of its key individuals. Failure to retain key individuals or to attract or retain additional key individuals with necessary skills could have a materially adverse impact upon the Company s success.
  16




  Volatility of Share Price
  Market prices for shares of early stage companies are often volatile. Factors such as announcements of mineral discoveries, financial results, and other factors could have a significant effect on the price of the Company s shares.
  Conflict of Interest
  Some of the Company s directors and officers are directors and officers of other natural resource or mining-related companies. These associations may give rise from time to time to conflicts of interest. As a result of such conflicts, the Company could potentially miss the opportunity to participate in certain transactions or opportunities.
  SHARE DATA
  As of July 23, 2010, the Company has 21,403,979 common shares without par value issued and outstanding. In addition, the Company has the obligation to issue the following additional common shares:
  
    
      a)      
      Incentive stock options that could result in the issuance of up to 1,795,000 common shares. Of these stock options, 495,000 are exercisable at $4.25 each, 480,000 are exercisable at $1.75 each, and 820,000 are exercisable at $1.00 each.
    
    
      
      
    
    
      b)
