    OPERATING
AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS
    
     The following discussion of EVATECH Co., Ltd. (“Evatech”) financial
condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in
conjunction with Evatech’s audited financial
statements and the related notes
for the years ended August 31, 2009 and
2008, included in this Report on Form 6-K. These financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan and are expressed in
Japanese Yen (JPY). The exchange rate
between the United States dollar (USD) and JPY was 92.74 and 109.36 as of August
31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and the average exchange rate between USD and
JPY was 96.05 and 109.18 for the fiscal year 2009 and 2008,
respectively.
    
    Overview
    
    Evatech of Kyoto, Japan, is a
22-year-old designer and manufacturer of industrial equipment for LCDs (liquid
crystal displays), PDPs (plasma display panels) and, amorphous-silicon (a-Si)
photovoltaic (PV) panels. Evatech’s main manufacturing
facility and its thin-film photovoltaic R&D center are located in Kyoto.
Evatech sells to customers
in Japan, China (it’s largest overseas market), and a limited number of other
countries.  Due to certain financial difficulties with the operation
of its business, Evatech
was the subject of a rehabilitation process in the courts of Japan related to
its corporate and debt restructuring that began in November, 2008 and ended with
A-Power’s acquisition of Evatech on January 25, 2010.
    
    On
September 16, 2009, A-Power Energy Generation Company Ltd. (“A-Power”), through
its wholly owned subsidiary Liaoning Gaoke Energy group company Ltd. (“Gaoke
Energy”) signed a contract to acquire 100% of Evatech. The total
consideration was $49.9 million in cash. On January 25, 2010, A-Power paid
$49.9 million to close the acquisition, after receiving the approval of the
court in which the rehabilitation proceeding was held.
    
     As  described
in Evatech's financial statements included elsewhere in this
Report, between November 2008 and the date of our acquisition of
Evatech, Evatech was the subject of a rehabilitation
process  under Japanese law  (somewhat similar to the
reorganization process under Chapter 11 of the United States
Code).  In addition, A-Power is in the process of integrating Evatech
and its business within the A-Power and its consolidated group and this
integration will make it difficult to compare the historical performance of
Evatech with the future performance of the former Evatech business. Before the
acquisition, Evatech focused on the production of equipment and materials for
liquid crystal displays, plasma displays and related products.
Evatech  had developed equipment to produce thin film and PV
components but did not commercialize this equipment. After its integration with
A-Power, we intend to adjust Evatech’s business lines to focus on equipment
for the manufacturing of PV cells and solar panels rather than equipment
for the manufacture of liquid crystal displays and plasma display
panels.   Evatech has a very limited track record in
the production and sale of equipment for manufacturing PV cells and
solar panels.  As March 31, 2010, we had not generated any material
revenue from the Evatech business and, subsequent to completion of the
Evatech acquisition in January 2010 through that date, we had received one
purchase order for a set of production equipment.  For all of these
reasons, the discussion below should not be considered to be indicative of the
future performance or capital needs of the former Evatech
business.

    Revenues
     
    For the
year ended August 31, 2009, total revenues amounted to JPY 493 million, a
decrease of JPY 3,879 million or 89%, from JPY 4,372 million for the
year ended August 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to Evatech
entering into the rehabilitation process since November, 2008,
during which only cash transaction revenue was earned as Evatech’s bank
accounts were frozen during the rehabilitation period.
     
    Cost
of Sales
    
    The total
cost of sales for year ended August 31, 2009 was JPY 542 million,
a decrease of JPY 2,992 million or 85% compared to JPY 3,534
million for the year ended August 31, 2008. This decrease in cost of
sales was due to the decreased business activity reflected in our decreased
revenues. This decrease of 85% in cost of sales is generally consistent
with the 89% decrease in revenues.
    
    Gross
Margin
    
    As a
percentage of total revenues, the overall gross margin was (10%) for the year
ended August 31, 2009 compared to 19% for the year ended August 31, 2008. The
decrease in gross margin is attributable to the sharp
revenue decline as the result of the rehabilitation process, while labor cost
for manufacturing parts continued through the 2009 fiscal
year.
    
     
    General
and Administrative Expenses
     
    General
and administrative expenses mainly include payroll and employee welfare
benefits, traveling and other expenses of administrative departments, such as
planning and financial, information systems and human resources.
     
    General
and administrative expenses amounted to approximately JPY 612
million for year ended August 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately
JPY 139 million, or 19%, compared to approximately JPY 751 million in
the year ended August 31, 2008. The decrease is mainly attributable to a
provision for bad debts of JPY 44 million in 2008. No provision for bad
debts was incurred in 2009. As a percentage of revenues these expenses increased
from 17% for the year ended August 31, 2008 to 124% for the year ended August
31, 2009, due to the decrease of JPY 3,879 million in
revenues.
     
    Operating
(Loss) Income
     
    Income
from operations decreased by approximately JPY 748 million from JPY 87
million for the year ended August 31, 2008 to JPY (661) million
for the year ended August 31, 2009. This was the net result of decreases of
JPY 3,879 million in revenues and JPY 2,992 million in cost of
sales. As a percentage of total revenues, the operating income for the year
ended August 31, 2009 was (134%) compared to 2% for the year ended August
31, 2008. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of total
revenues was mainly due to the decrease in revenues and gross
margins.
     
    Non-operational
Income
     
    Non-operational
income decreased approximately JPY 12 million to JPY 5 million for the year
ended August 31, 2009 from JPY 17 million for the year ended August 31, 2008.
The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in dividend income and miscellaneous
income.

    Non-operational
expense decreased from JPY 89 million in 2008 to JPY 79 million in 2009. The
decrease was mainly due to decreased interest expenses from JPY 77 million for
the ended August 31, 2008 to JPY 70 million for the year ended August 31,
2009.
    
    Extraordinary
Income
    
    Extraordinary
income increased from JPY 3 million in 2008 to JPY 74 million in 2009. The
increase was mainly due to the 2009 bonus accrual reversal of JPY 12 million,
insurance cancellation in 2009 of JPY 47 million, and gain on debt exemption of
JPY 15 million in 2009.
    
    Extraordinary
Loss
    
    Extraordinary
loss increased significantly from JPY 0.2 million in 2008 to JPY 478 million in
2009. The increase was mainly due to the bad debt reserve of JPY 320 million in
2009, write-off of 2008 accounts receivable of JPY 39 million, write-off of 2009
accounts receivable of JPY 30 million, and a JPY 55 million inventory loss
provision in 2009.
    
     
    Income
Tax Provision
     
    The
income tax provision for the year ended August 31, 2009 was JPY 112
million, compared to an income tax recovery of JPY (76) million for the
year ended August 31, 2008. The increase in the income tax provision
from 2008 was primarily attributed to write off of the deferred tax assets
in fiscal year 2009.
      
    Net
(Loss) Income
     
    For the
year ended August 31, 2009, our net loss amounted to approximately JPY
(1,251) million, a decrease of JPY 1,344 million, compared to the
net income of JPY 93 million for the year ended August 31, 2008. The
decrease in net income is attributable to of the reduction in gross margins
and approximately JPY 350 million of bad debts recognized as the result of
the rehabilitation.

    Comparison
of Years Ended August 31, 2009 and 2008
    
    Net cash
used in operating activities totaled JPY 679 million for the year ended
August 31, 2009, the cash provided by operating activities decreased by
JPY 1,464 million compared to the net cash provided by operating
activities of JPY 785 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease resulted
primarily from the net loss of JPY 1,251 million for the year ended August
31, 2009, compared with net income of JPY 93 million for the year ended August
31, 2008.
    
    Net cash
provided by financing activities amounted to JPY 431 million for the year ended
August 31, 2009, compared to net cash used in financing activities of JPY
749 million for the year ended August 31, 2008. The increase of JPY
1,180 million in positive cash flow was attributable to proceeds of JPY 458
million from short loan in 2009, compared with the net repayments of short term
loan of JPY 1,021 million in 2008.

    Working
Capital
    
    Our
working capital decreased by approximately JPY 1,908 million to JPY (2,473)
million as of August 31, 2009, compared to JPY (565) million as of August 31,
2008.
    
    Total
current assets as at August 31, 2009 amounted to JPY 1,833 million, a
decrease of approximately JPY 1,693 million compared to JPY 3,526
million as at August 31, 2008. The decrease was mainly attributable to
a decrease of approximately JPY 824 million in accounts receivable,
approximately JPY 409 million in inventory and approximately
JPY 248 million in cash.
    
    Total
current liabilities as at August 31, 2009 amounted to JPY 4,306 million, an
increase of approximately JPY 215 million, compared to JPY 4,091
million as of August 31, 2008. This increase was primarily
attributable to an increase of approximately JPY 458 million in short term
loan, which was offset by the reduction of notes payables of JPY 206
million.
    
    Our
current ratio decreased to 0.43 as at August 31, 2009 from 0.86 as
of August 31, 2008. The decrease in our current ratio was primarily due to
the growth of 2009 current liabilities at a faster rate than the growth of
current assets, attributable to liabilities incurred in connection with short
term loans.
