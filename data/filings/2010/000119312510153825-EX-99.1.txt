 AEGON appoints global head of human resources 
AEGON has appointed Carla Mahieu as its global head of human resources, reporting to CEO Alex Wynaendts. The appointment, effective September 1, 2010, is part
of the strategic objective to more fully leverage AEGON’s considerable resources across its businesses.  Ms. Mahieu, a Dutch national, brings
more than 25 years’ experience to the new position, having held senior management positions in human resources at Royal Dutch Shell and Royal Philips Electronics as well as the recruitment firm Spencer Stuart. Ms. Mahieu’s appointment
will support AEGON’s efforts to attract, develop and retain the best talent in the international life insurance, pension and investment industry. 
“We are delighted to have attracted someone of Carla’s caliber to AEGON,” said CEO Alex Wynaendts. “This is an extremely important position.
Ours is a service business, and as such, AEGON’s reputation depends on the quality of our people and their ability to develop and deliver the services our customers require and expect. AEGON has tremendous resources across its many markets.
Carla will play an integral role in ensuring that we are fully leveraging the expertise and talent of our people and putting those resources to work for our customers, business partners, and for the benefit of our entire organization.”
 As part of its long-term strategy, AEGON has taken a more integrated approach to managing its worldwide operations in recent years, and the appointment
of Ms. Mahieu will now extend that approach to talent and human resource management. She will work closely with local and regional HR officers to ensure a more coordinated approach to identifying persons and capabilities that may prove
beneficial to AEGON’s operations internationally. In addition, she will implement a more consistent approach to measuring employee satisfaction across the AEGON Group. 
Ms. Mahieu has a degree in economics from the University of Amsterdam and is currently an independent advisor in the area of human resources and change
management.
