<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In the interest of providing the Company's shareholders and potential investors with information regarding the Company, including managements' assessment of the future plans and operations of the Company, certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements or information (collectively &#147;forward-looking statements&#148;) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as &#147;anticipate&#148;, &#147;continue&#148;, &#147;estimate&#148;, &#147;expect&#148;, &#147;forecast&#148;, &#147;may&#148;, &#147;will&#148;, &#147;project&#148;, &#147;could&#148;, &#147;plan&#148;, &#147;intend&#148;, &#147;should&#148;, &#147;believe&#148;, &#147;outlook&#148;, &#147;potential&#148;, &#147;target&#148; and similar words suggesting future events or future performance. In addition, statements relating to &#147;resources&#148; are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they invol
ve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future. In particular, this document contains, without limitation, forward-looking statements pertaining to the following: expectations of management regarding the termination of the agreement to acquire Sterling, payment of the termination fee and the company&#146;s review of additional resource opportunities including the timing of completion of an acquisition; potential synergies resulting from an acquisition and the effect of the acquisition on the Company's operations.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">With respect to forward-looking statements contained in this document, we have made assumptions regarding, among other things: future capital expenditure levels; future silver and base and precious metals prices and future silver and base and precious metal production levels; future exchange rates and interest rates; our ability to obtain equipment other resources in a timely manner to carry out development activities; our ability to market our silver and base and precious metals successfully to current and new customers; the impact of increasing competition; our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms; our ability to attract new senior management and board members; and our ability to add production and resources through our development and exploitation activities. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this document, and the assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are made, are reasonabl
e, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements included in this document, as there can be no assurance that the plans, intentions or expectations upon which the forward-looking statements are based will occur. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not occur, which may cause the Company&#146;s actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially from any estimates or projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the following: that the proposed transaction may not close when planned or at all or on the terms and conditions set forth herein; the failure of the Compa
ny to obtain the necessary Court, TSX Venture Exchange, regulatory and other third party approvals required in order to proceed with the proposed transaction; volatility in market prices for silver and other base and precious metals; incorrect assessment of the value of the acquisition; failure to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the</P>
