adding an independent director with the extensive international experience and credibility,
exemplified by Dr.&nbsp;DeWoskin. We are very excited that he has agreed to join us and look forward to
working together, as the Company stands to directly benefit from Dr.&nbsp;DeWoskin&#146;s experience,
knowledge and counsel.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Dr.&nbsp;DeWoskin is a former partner for Strategy and Business Development at one of the Big Four

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Update on Ongoing Strategic Review</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2009, in conjunction with the appointment of senior management, Agria announced that
it would conduct a strategic review led by the new CEO, Mr Xie Tao. This encompassed an assessment
of the current state of the business and development of a new strategy to deploy the company&#146;s
assets and repositioning to increase shareholder value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The core operations of Agria have experienced a significant decline since 2008 as greater strategic
focus and scale are needed for each of the three business segments, corn seeds, sheep breeding and
seedling. The company&#146;s management now believes a repositioning of the company is required to
restart growth. Agria expects the repositioning will include bringing additional management
resources to sustain development of necessary competences and drive the potential synergies among
business lines.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The appointments announced today mark an important milestone in strengthening the strategic
capabilities of the Board, which will in the future take a more active role in shaping major
business decisions in addition to being responsible for corporate governance matters.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Management believes that Agria&#146;s growth has been delayed, but the company&#146;s potential is not
fundamentally impaired. Further, management believes that market conditions if changed have
improved, and strong foreign and domestic investment flows into the sector confirm a belief that
government and business are aligned in seeking dramatic improvement in agricultural productivity in
the current decade. Agria&#146;s strategic vision is to create an agricultural company focused on
achieving profitable growth from exploiting resource-based opportunities, rapidly building a
relevant talent base, applying global best practices, and using both domestic and international M&#038;A
to complement organic growth in achieving these goals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">More specifically as the strategic review enters its implementation phase, Agria will focus on
