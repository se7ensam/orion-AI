Minutes of the Annual General Meeting held at the offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route
d’Esch, Luxembourg on May 28, 2010




The Meeting was opened at 2.00 p.m.

 

Chairman          :  Mr. Alistair Peel, Company Secretary of Acergy S.A.

 

Secretary          :  Maître Philippe HOSS


Ballot-judges    :  Mrs. Chantal MATHU and Mrs. Céline BONVALET




The Chairman declared and the Meeting noted that:








·  


it appeared from the main register kept by SGG S.A. and the Branch Register kept by DnB NOR Bank ASA of Oslo produced to the Meeting together with proxies duly filed within the statutory period that 70,912,447 Common Shares out of 194,953,972 issued Common Shares and 183,429,857 outstanding Common Shares as at March 29, 2010 were represented.











·  


the notice of the Meeting was published according to the legal requirements in the “Luxemburger Wort” a Luxembourg daily newspaper and in the "Mémorial C" on May 10, 2010 and May 19, 2010 as evidenced by the documents presented to the Meeting and in accordance with article 26 of the Articles of Incorporation (i) notice of this Meeting together with a proxy card, a letter of explanation and a business reply envelope have been mailed to the Common Shareholders on the Company’s Registers as of March 29, 2010 and (ii) notice of this Meeting together with a proxy card, the letter of explanation and a business reply envelope were also mailed to the holders of American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (each of which represents one Common Share of the Company) on the register of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Depositary for the ADSs, as 
of March 29, 2010.











·  


in order to attend the present Meeting, the Common Shares represented complied with the legal and statutory requirements.











·  


the present Meeting was therefore regularly convened and has the legal power to act on the items 1 to 15 inclusive of the agenda.











·  


The Chairman refers to the agenda as published in the Luxembourg daily and the Mémorial.











·  


The Chairman explained the variances between the agenda as published and the agenda sent to the shareholders. The reason for this change is that Luxembourg law in particular law 18, December 2009 (the “Law”) provides that only authorised statutory auditors in Luxembourg have the right to report and certify accounts of Luxembourg companies. The Chairman recites the relevant legal provisions.







Consequently the official accounts of the Company for any legal Luxembourg purpose whatsoever have to be those signed by Deloitte S.A., rather than Deloitte LLP, in particular with respect to reporting and approving by shareholders. Similarly only Deloitte S.A. may be appointed as Authorised Statutory Auditor. Resolutions 1 and 14 reflect this.  It will be up to Deloitte S.A. to determine to what extent it may seek the assistance of other professionals.
