Ballard Reports Third Quarter 2010 Results

Strong quarter takes year-to-date revenue growth to 45%


For Immediate Release – October 27, 2010


VANCOUVER, CANADA– Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDP) announced its financial results
for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010 today. All amounts are consolidated to include
Dantherm Power’s results and are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.


John Sheridan, President and CEO said “Our solid third quarter results provide further evidence
that Ballard is building the capability for strong revenue growth in clean energy fuel cell
products and driving aggressively to profitability. Revenue growth in the quarter was 83% and, on a
year-to-date basis, now stands at 45%.” He added that, “Our strong liquidity position, with cash
reserves of $72.9 million, will enable us to deliver on strong growth prospects in our key fuel
cell markets of backup power, distributed generation, material handling and bus.”


Third Quarter 2010 Highlights


Growth:






     
    •
     
    Revenue of $16.5 million in the quarter and $43.9 million year-to-date, representing
growth of 83% and 45%, respectively.









     
    •
     
    Total shipments of 683 fuel cell stacks in the quarter and 1,895 fuel cell stacks
year-to-date, representing growth of 137% and 105%, respectively.









     
    •
     
    Backup power shipments grew 87% to 401 fuel cell stacks in the quarter,
for a total of 1,010 fuel cell stacks year-to-date. This reflects shipments to
IdaTech, LLC and regional system integrators in South East Asia and Europe.









     
    •
     
    Material handling shipments more than doubled in the quarter to 211 fuel
cell stacks. On a year-to-date basis, shipments were 755 fuel cell stacks, or more
than four times the full-year total of 182 fuel cell stacks in 2009.









     
    •
     
    Significant progress in distributed generation, including a sales agreement with K2 Pure
Solutions for deployment of a CLEARgenTM fuel cell generator utilizing
by-product hydrogen to be sited at a bleach plant in Pittsburg, California, as well as
delivery of a utility-scale CLEARgenTM distributed generation system to
FirstEnergy Generation Corp. in Ohio.









     
    •
     
    Twelve-month rolling order book of $30.0 million.





Profitability:






     
    •
     
    EBITDA1 of ($4.2) million for the quarter and ($22.0) million year-to-date,
representing improvements of 57% and 6%, respectively.









     
    •
     
    Net loss of $5.6 million for the quarter and $26.5 million year-to-date, representing
improvements of 51% and 8%, respectively.









     
    •
     
    Cash flow from operations of ($4.8) million. On a comparable year-over-year basis,
excluding Dantherm Power, cash flow from operations was ($3.2) million for a total of
($24.8) million year-to-date. This represents improvements of 31% and 13%, respectively.









     
    •
     
    Cash reserves of $72.9 million.





Guidance:






     
    •
     
    Ballard reconfirms full-year guidance of revenue growth in excess of 35% and improvement
in cash flow from operations of 30%, excluding the cash flow impact of Dantherm Power and a
negative foreign exchange impact.





Growth Milestones in 2010:






     
    •
     
    Delivered three of six milestones.









     
    •
     
    Deployed Dantherm Power hydrogen-based backup power systems in one major
new network, specifically Wind Mobile in Canada.









     
    •
     
    Delivered a one-megawatt distributed generation system to FirstEnergy
Generation Corp. in Ohio.









     
    •
     
    Booked the first distributed generation system sale utilizing by-product
hydrogen, for K2 Pure Solutions.









     
    •
     
    On-track to deliver two of six milestones.









     
    •
     
    More than double the volume of stack shipments in material handling, in
line with Plug Power’s 2010 shipment target.








     
     
     





    •

     
    oBook new fuel cell bus contracts to support the deployment of more than 25 buses.
One of six milestones is ‘at risk’.










     
    •
     
    Begin shipments of Ballard’s fuel cell stacks for deployment of IdaTech’s
reformate-based supplemental power systems for the Indian telecoms market. This may
be delayed into the first half of 2011.

Endnotes:

1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used to assist in assessing Ballard’s financial
performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by
GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
EBITDA measures net loss after excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation of
property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges.
EBITDA includes the impact attributable to Ballard’s controlling interest in Dantherm Power.
Ballard believes that EBITDA assists investors in assessing actual and future performance. For a
reconciliation of EBITDA to the Consolidated Financial Statements, please refer to Ballard’s
Management’s Discussion & Analysis.
