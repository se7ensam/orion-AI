    •
     
    Revenues from traditional media in airports increased by 115.5% year-over-year and by

million in the same period one year ago and loss from operations of US$8.5 million in the
previous quarter.








     
    •
     
    Net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders was US$4.7 million, improving from net
loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$7.0 million in the same period one year
ago and net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$6.5 million in the previous
quarter. Basic and diluted loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per American

attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and
amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$424,000, improving from adjusted net
loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) of US$5.4 million in the same

    •
     
    The Company generated positive operating cash flow in excess of capital
expenditure in the second quarter of 2010. Other than restricted cash of US$1.4 million,
cash and short-term investments increased to US$83.5 million as of June 30, 2010 from
$76.2 million as of March 31, 2010.





“Our business continued to turn around in the second quarter of 2010 with new record total
revenues of US$56.3 million. We experienced another quarter of improved advertising spending in
China, indicating that a sustained recovery of advertising is under way in 2010. Our forecast of
continued revenue ramp up in the third quarter further boosts our confidence to break even under
U.S. GAAP in the third quarter of this year,” commented Herman Guo, chairman and chief executive
officer of AirMedia. “Other than the gas station media network, we have completed our media
expansion in the short term. Going forward, we will continue to focus on improving our
profitability and fully realizing the operating leverage of our business model based on fixed
concession fees during contract periods, allowing revenue growth to directly bring about
profitability growth,” Mr. Guo added.

“We are pleased to see that our improving business performance is reflected in the Company’s
financial results,” Xiaoya Zhang, AirMedia’s president and acting chief financial officer,
commented. “Traditional media in airports, which had been our biggest drag in 2009, started to
contribute to net profits in the second quarter of 2010. With non-GAAP adjusted net loss close to
break even in the second quarter of 2010, we expect our U.S. GAAP net income to break even in the
next quarter. We are particularly delighted that we generated positive operating cash flow
in excess of capital expenditure this quarter. With the improved cash balance as of the end
of the second quarter of 2010, we believe we have sufficient cash to support our operations in the
foreseeable future,” Mr. Zhang added.

Total revenues for the second quarter of 2010 reached US$56.3 million, representing a
year-over-year increase of 53.0% from US$36.8 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 15.5%
from US$48.8 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from
digital frames in airports, traditional media in airports, other media, digital TV screens on
airplanes and the gas station media network. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to
increases in revenues from digital frames in airports, traditional media in airports, the gas
station media network and other media.


Revenues from digital frames in airports



Revenues from digital frames in airports for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 64.0%
year-over-year and by 20.6% quarter-over-quarter to US$27.0 million. The year-over-year increase
was due to an increase in the number of time slots sold, which was partially offset by a decrease
in the average advertising revenue per time slot sold (the “ASP”). The quarter-over-quarter
increase was due to increases in both the ASP and the number of time slots sold. Please refer to
“Summary of Selected Operating Data” below for detailed definitions of the operating data cited in
this press release.


The number of time slots sold for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 74.5% year-over-year and
by 8.6% quarter-over-quarter to 9,918 time slots. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter
increases were due to continued sales efforts and growing acceptance of AirMedia’s digital frames.
AirMedia’s digital frames were in operation in 33 airports in the second quarter of 2010, up from
28 airports at the end of the second quarter of 2009 and 32 airports at the end of the first
quarter of 2010. The number of time slots available for sale for the second quarter of 2010
increased by 24.5% year-over-year and by 8.5% quarter-over-quarter to 32,708 time slots. The
year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily due to an increase in the
number of airports in AirMedia’s digital frame network. The utilization rate of digital frames for
the second quarter of 2010 increased by 8.7 percentage points year-over-year to 30.3% and remained
unchanged from the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the increase
in the number of time slots sold, which was partially offset by the increase in the number of time
slots available for sale.

The ASP of digital frames for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by 6.0% year-over-year and
increased by 11.1% quarter-over-quarter to US$2,724. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due
to higher discounts offered in the second quarter of 2010 than in the same period one year ago. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the change in the mix of time slots sold. The
number of time slots sold in the top three airports, which have significantly higher ASPs than
those sold in other airports, accounted for a higher percentage of total number of time slots sold
in the second quarter of 2010 than in the previous quarter.


Revenues from digital TV screens in airports



Revenues from digital TV screens in airports for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by 28.2%
year-over-year and increased by 1.2% quarter-over-quarter to US$6.6 million.


The number of time slots sold for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by 8.7 % year-over-year and
by 28.8% quarter-over-quarter to 5,344 time slots. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to
advertisers’ shift in their budget allocations from our digital TV screens in airports to our other
products in airports and on airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily attributable
to AirMedia’s termination of a promotional campaign, which had been adopted in the first quarter of
2010 and offered high discount from the listing prices. The number of time slots available for sale
for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by 9.5% year-over-year and by 0.4% quarter-over-quarter to
22,950 time slots primarily due to the termination of operation of digital TV screens in certain
second-tier and third-tier airports. The utilization rate for the second quarter of 2010 increased
by 0.2 percentage point year-over-year and decreased by 9.3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter
to 23.3%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the decrease in the number of time slots
available for sale. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the
number of time slots sold.


The ASP of digital TV screens in airports for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by 21.3 %
year-over-year and increased by 42.2% quarter-over-quarter to US$1,226. The year-over-year decrease
was primarily due to higher discounts offered in the second quarter of 2010 than in the same period
one year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to the termination of
the promotional campaign which had been adopted in the first quarter of 2010.


Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes



Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 49.3%
year-over-year and decreased by 14.4% quarter-over-quarter to US$5.9 million. The year-over-year
increase was due to increases in both the number of time slots sold and the ASP of digital TV
screens on airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to decreases in both the number of
time slots sold and the ASP of digital TV screens on airplanes.


The number of time slots sold for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 38.5% year-over-year and
decreased by 9.4% quarter-over-quarter to 259 time slots. The year-over-year increase was due to
continued sales efforts, and the quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to seasonality. Although the
first quarter is in general a weak quarter for our advertising business as a whole, it is a peak
season for advertising on digital TV screens on airplanes as advertisers place more advertising
orders to take advantage of high passenger volume during the Spring Festival holiday period in
China. The number of time slots available for sale for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by
15.4% year-over-year and by 2.9% quarter-over-quarter to 396 time slots. The year-over-year
decrease was primarily due to the termination of our operation of digital TV
screens on the airplanes of China United Airlines and less advertising time on Air China’s
airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to the termination of our operation
of digital TV screens on the airplanes of China United Airlines. The utilization rate for the
second quarter of 2010 increased by 25.4 percentage points year-over-year and decreased by 4.7
percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 65.4%. The year-over-year increase was due to the
increase in the number of time slots sold and the decrease in the number of time slots available
for sale. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of time
slots sold.

The ASP of digital TV screens on airplanes for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 7.8%
year-over-year and decreased by 5.4% quarter-over-quarter to US$22,672. The year-over-year increase
in the ASP was primarily due to lower discounts offered in the second quarter of 2010 than in the
same period one year ago and the increase in the listing prices of digital TV screens on Air
China’s airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in the ASP was primarily due to higher
discounts offered in the second quarter of 2010 than in the first quarter of 2010.


Revenues from traditional media in airports



Revenues from traditional media in airports for the second quarter of 2010 primarily included
revenues from traditional media in Beijing Capital International Airport, Shenzhen International
Airport and Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport, as well as revenues from billboards and painted
advertisements on gate bridges in certain airports. Revenues from traditional media in airports for
the second quarter of 2010 increased by 115.5% year-over-year and by 23.7% quarter-over-quarter to
US$12.2 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to continued sales efforts and
growing acceptance of AirMedia’s traditional media in airports. The quarter-over-quarter increase
was primarily due to an increase in the number of locations sold.


The number of locations sold for the second quarter of 2010 increased 45.4% year-over-year and
15.8% quarter-over-quarter to 455 locations primarily due to continued sales efforts. The number of
locations available for sale for the second quarter of 2010 decreased by 35.9% year-over-year and
increased by 3.7% quarter-over-quarter to 705 locations. The year-over-year decrease was primarily
because AirMedia terminated the operation of certain unprofitable traditional media in Beijing
Capital International Airport as well as billboards and painted advertisements on gate bridges in
certain airports in the first quarter of 2010. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due
to the increase in the number of billboards in the Wenzhou airport and light boxes in certain
airports. The utilization rate of traditional media for the second quarter of 2010 increased by
36.1 percentage points year-over-year and by 6.7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 64.5%.
The year-over-year increase was due to the decrease in the number of locations available for sale
and the increase in the number of locations sold. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily
due to the increase in the number of locations sold.


The ASP of traditional media in airports for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 48.1%
year-over-year and by 6.8% quarter-over-quarter to US$26,903 primarily due to more locations with
higher listing prices sold in the second quarter of 2010.


Revenues from the gas station media network



Revenues from the gas station media network for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 355.1%
quarter-over-quarter to US$801,000.


As of August 8, 2010, AirMedia had installed its media, including scrolling light boxes and
billboards, in a total of 1,545 Sinopec gas stations, of which 214 are located in Beijing, 295 in
Shanghai, 104 in Shenzhen and the remaining 932 in 14 other cities.

Revenues from other media 


Revenues from other media were primarily revenues from Beijing AirMedia City Outdoor Advertising
Co., Ltd., a company AirMedia acquired in January 2010, which operates unipole signs and other
outdoor media across Beijing. Revenues from other media increased 20.3% quarter-over-quarter to
US$3.0 million due to more media resources sold.


Please refer to “Summary of Selected Operating Data” for more operating data.


Business tax and other sales tax



Business tax and other sales tax for the second quarter of 2010 were US$1.2 million, compared to
US$524,000 in the same period one year ago and US$1.0 million in the previous quarter. For purposes
of calculating the amount of business and other sales tax, concession fees are permitted to be
deducted from total revenues under applicable PRC tax law.


Net revenues



Net revenues for the second quarter of 2010 reached US$55.1 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 51.8% from US$36.3 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 15.3% from US$47.8
million.


Cost of Revenues



Cost of revenues for the second quarter of 2010 was US$48.6 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 32.2% from US$36.8 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 6.8% from US$45.5
million. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily due to an increase in
concession fees in connection with the expansion of AirMedia’s business. Cost of revenues as a
percentage of net revenues in the second quarter of 2010 was 88.2%, compared to 101.3% in the same
period one year ago and 95.3% in the previous quarter.


AirMedia incurs concession fees to airports for placing and operating digital TV screens, digital
frames, traditional media and other displays in airports, to airlines for playing programs on their
digital TV screens, to Sinopec for placing outdoor media in its gas stations, and to other media
resources owners for placing unipole signs and other outdoor media across Beijing.


Concession fees for the second quarter of 2010 were US$33.3 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 18.7% from US$28.1 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 4.3% from US$31.9
million. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily due to newly signed
or renewed concession rights contracts during the period. Concession fees as a percentage of net
revenues in the second quarter of 2010 was 60.4%, decreasing from 77.3% in the same period one year
ago and 66.9% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases of
concession fees as a percentage of net revenues were primarily due to the fact that revenues
continued to ramp up while incremental concession fees grew at a slower pace than revenue growth.
AirMedia has no intention to materially expand its media resources in the near term until it has
returned to strong and sustainable profitability.


Gross Profit/Loss 



Gross profit for the second quarter of 2010 was US$6.5 million, improving from gross loss of
US$488,000 in the same period one year ago and gross profit of US$2.2 million in the previous
quarter.


Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the second quarter of 2010 was 11.8%, compared to
gross loss as a percentage of net revenues of negative 1.3% in the same period one year ago and
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues of 4.7% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter improvements in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues were
primarily due to the increase in net revenues.

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were US$12.2 million, representing a
year-over-year increase of 54.4% from US$7.9 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 13.7%
from US$10.8 million.


On June 30, 2010, to provide better incentive to its employees, the Compensation Committee of
AirMedia’s board of directors approved an adjustment to the exercise price of certain outstanding
stock options, which were granted on July 2, 2007, July 20, 2007, November 29, 2007 and July 10,
2009, respectively. The revised exercise price for each option is US$1.57 per ordinary share, or
US$3.14 per ADS. The re-pricing of these stock options resulted in one-time share-based
compensation expenses of US$1.6 million in the second quarter of 2010. Total operating expenses for
the second quarter of 2010 included share-based compensation expenses of US$3.4 million, compared
to share-based compensation expenses of US$1.0 million in the same period one year ago and
share-based compensation expenses of US$1.8 million in the previous quarter.


Adjusted operating expenses (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2010, which excluded share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, were US$7.9 million,
representing a year-over-year increase of 25.6% from US$6.3 million and a quarter-over-quarter
decrease of 1.9% from US$8.1 million. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues
(non-GAAP) in the second quarter of 2010 was 14.4%, compared to 17.4% in the same period one year
ago and 16.9% in the previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP
Adjusted Operating Expenses” for a reconciliation of operating expenses under U.S. GAAP to adjusted
operating expenses (non-GAAP).


Selling and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were US$4.5 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$927,000. This represented a year-over-year increase of
65.8% from US$2.7 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 10.2% from US$4.1 million in the
previous quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to
expansion of the direct sales force and increased share-based compensation expenses. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the one-time share-based compensation expenses
associated with the re-pricing of stock options in the second quarter of 2010.


General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were US$7.7 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$2.5 million. This represented a year-over-year increase of
48.3% from US$5.2 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 15.8% from US$6.6 million. The
year-over-year increase was primarily due to the one-time share-based compensation expenses
associated with the re-pricing of stock options in the second quarter of 2010, higher bad-debt
provisions, and higher amortization of acquired intangible assets. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the one-time share-based compensation expenses
associated with the re-pricing of stock options in the second quarter of 2010, which were partially
offset by lower bad-debt provisions.

Loss from Operations



Loss from operations for the second quarter of 2010 was US5.8 million, as compared to loss from
operations of US$8.4 million in the same period one year ago and loss from operations of US$8.5
million in the previous quarter.


Adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2010, which excluded share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$1.4 million, compared
to adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) of US$6.8 million in the same period one year ago and
adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) of US$5.8 million in the previous quarter. Adjusted
operating margin (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2010, which excluded the effect of
share-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was negative
2.6%, compared to negative 18.7% in the same period one year ago and negative 12.2% in the previous
quarter.


Please refer to the attached table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Loss from Operations to
Non-GAAP Adjusted Loss from Operations” for a reconciliation of loss from operations under U.S.
GAAP to adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP).


Income Tax Benefit/Expenses



Income tax expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were US$19,000, compared to income tax benefit
of US$653,000 in the same period one year ago and income tax expenses of US$21,000 in the previous
quarter.


Net Loss Attributable to AirMedia’s Shareholders



Net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders for the second quarter of 2010 was US$4.7 million,
compared to net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$7.0 million in the same period
one year ago and net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$6.5 million in the previous
quarter. The basic and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS for the
second quarter of 2010 were both US$0.07, compared to basic and diluted net loss attributable to
AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.11 in the same period one year ago and basic and diluted
net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.10 in the previous quarter.


Adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of
2010, which is net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation
expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$424,000, compared to adjusted net
loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) of US$5.4 million in the same period one
year ago and adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) of US$3.8 million
in the previous quarter. Basic and diluted adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2010 were both US$0.01, compared to basic
and diluted adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) of US$0.08
in the same period one year ago and basic and diluted adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) of US$0.06 in the previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table for a reconciliation of net loss attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders and basic and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS under
U.S. GAAP to adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) and basic and
diluted adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP).

Cash, Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments



Other than restricted cash of US$1.4 million, cash and short-term investments totaled US$83.5
million as of June 30, 2010, compared to US$124.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and 76.2 million
as of March 31, 2010. The decrease in cash and short-term investments from December 31, 2009 was
primarily due to an increase in prepaid concession fees incurred, based on the terms of certain
material concession rights contracts. The increase in cash and short-term investments from March
31, 2010 was primarily due to an increase in cash flow from operations.


Other Recent Developments



AirMedia obtained a concession rights contract to sell advertisements on the digital TV screens on
the airplanes of Hainan Airlines, the fourth largest airline in mainland China, from August 1, 2010
to March 31, 2012.


On June 30, 2010, to provide better incentive to its employees, the Compensation Committee of
AirMedia’s board of directors approved an adjustment to the exercise price of certain outstanding
stock options, which were granted on July 2, 2007, July 20, 2007, November 29, 2007 and July 10,
2009, respectively.


Business Outlook 



AirMedia currently expects that its total revenues for the third quarter of 2010 will range from
US$60.0 million to US$62.0 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 59.0% to 64.3% from
the same period in 2009.


AirMedia currently expects that concession fees will be at least US$33.5 million in the third
quarter of 2010.


The above forecast reflects AirMedia’s current and preliminary view and is therefore subject to
change. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement below for the factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

Notes:


(1) We define a time slot as a 30-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital TV screens in
airports and digital TV screens on airplanes, which is shown during each advertising cycle on a
weekly basis in a given airport or on a monthly basis on the routes of a given airline,
respectively. Our airport advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a given
week in one-hour cycles and each hour of programming includes 25 minutes of advertising content,
which allows us to sell a maximum of 50 time slots per week. The number of time slots available for
our digital TV screens in airports during the period presented is calculated by multiplying the
time slots per week per airport by the number of weeks during the period presented when we had
operations in each airport and then calculating the sum of all the time slots available for each of
our network airports. The length of our in-flight programs typically ranges from approximately 45
minutes to an hour per flight, approximately five to 13 minutes of which consist of advertising
content. The number of time slots available for our digital TV screens on airplanes during the
period presented is calculated by multiplying the time slots per airline per month by the number of
months during the period presented when we had operations on each airline and then calculating the
sum of all the time slots for each of our network airlines.


(2) We define a time slot as a 12-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital frames in
airports, which is shown during each standard advertising cycle on a weekly basis in a given
airport. Our standard airport advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a
given week in 10-minute cycles, which allows us to sell a maximum of 50 time slots per week. The
length of time slot and advertising program cycle of some digital frames in several airports are
different from standard ones. The number of time slots available for our digital frames in airports
during the period presented is calculated by multiplying the time slots per week per airport by the
number of weeks during the period presented when we had operations in each airport and then
calculating the sum of all the time slots available for each of our network airports.


(3) Number of time slots sold refers to the number of 30-second equivalent advertising time units
for digital TV screens in airports and digital TV screens on airplanes or 12-second equivalent
advertising time units for digital frames in airports sold during the period presented.


(4) Utilization rate refers to total time slots sold as a percentage of total time slots available
for sale during the relevant period.


(5) Average advertising revenue per time slot sold for digital TV screens in airports, digital TV
screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports is calculated by dividing our revenues derived
from digital TV screens in airports, digital TV screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports
by its own number of time slots sold, respectively.


(6) We define the number of locations available for sale in traditional media as the sum of (1) the
number of light boxes and billboards in Beijing, Shenzhen, Wenzhou and certain other airports
(light boxes and billboards), and (2) the number of gate bridges in 10 airports (gate bridges).


(7) The number of locations sold is defined as the sum of (1) the number of light boxes and
billboards sold and (2) the number of gate bridges sold. To calculate the number of light boxes and
billboards sold in a given airport, we first calculate the “utilization rates of light boxes and
billboards” in such airport by dividing the “total value of light boxes and billboards sold” in
such airport by the “total value of light boxes and billboards” in such airport. The “total value
of light boxes and billboards sold” in a given airport is calculated as the daily listing prices of
each light boxes and billboards sold multiplied by their respective number of days sold during the
period presented. The “total value of light boxes and billboards” in a given airport is calculated
as the sum of quarterly listing prices of all the light boxes and billboards during the period
presented. The number of light boxes and billboards sold in a given airport is then calculated as
the number of light boxes and billboards available for sale in such airport multiplied by the
utilization rates of light boxes and billboards in such airport. The number of gate bridges sold in
a given airport is counted based on the contracts.


(8) Utilization rate refers to total locations sold as a percentage of total locations available
for sale during the period presented.


(9) Average advertising revenue per location sold is calculated by dividing the revenues derived
from all the locations sold by the number of locations sold during the period presented.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



AirMedia’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of AirMedia’s
comparative operating performance and future prospects. AirMedia’s non-GAAP financial measures
exclude the following non-cash items: (1) share-based compensation expenses, and (2) amortization
of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by AirMedia’s management in
their financial and operating decision-making, because management believes they reflect AirMedia’s
ongoing business and operating performance in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period
comparisons. AirMedia’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful
information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating AirMedia’s operating
performance in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. Specifically, AirMedia
believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and
investors by excluding certain charges that the Company believes are not indicative of its core
operating results.


The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. They do not include all items of income and
expense that affect AirMedia’s income from operations. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies and, with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude
certain items under GAAP, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer to AirMedia.
Management compensates for these limitations by also considering AirMedia’s financial results as
determined in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to
be considered superior to, in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance
with US GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table
captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss and EPS and Non-GAAP Adjusted Loss and EPS”,
“Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses” and
“Reconciliation of GAAP Loss from Operations to Non-GAAP Adjusted Loss from Operations” set forth
at the end of this release.

Safe Harbor Statement



This announcement contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“future,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “confident” and similar statements. Among other
things, the Business Outlook section and the quotations from management in this announcement, as
well as AirMedia Group Inc.’s strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements.
AirMedia may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its reports to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and
other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to
third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about AirMedia’s
beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve
inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to: if advertisers or the viewing public do not accept,
or lose interest in, our air travel advertising network, we may be unable to generate sufficient
cash flow from our operating activities and our prospects and results of operations could be
negatively affected; we derive most of our revenues from the provision of air travel advertising
services, and any slowdown in the air travel advertising industry in China may materially and
adversely affect our revenues and results of operation; our strategy of expanding our advertising
network by building new air travel media platforms and expanding into traditional media in airports
may not succeed, and our failure to do so could materially reduce the attractiveness of our network
and harm our business, reputation and results of operations; if we do not succeed in our expansion
into gas station and other outdoor media advertising, our future results of operations and growth
prospects may be materially and adversely affected; if our customers reduce their advertising
spending or are unable to pay us in full, in part or at all for a period of time due to an economic
downturn in China and/or elsewhere or for any other reason, our revenues and results of operations
may be materially and adversely affected; we face risks related to health epidemics, which could
materially and adversely affect air travel and result in reduced demand for our advertising
services or disrupt our operations; if we are unable to retain existing concession rights contracts
or obtain new concession rights contracts on commercially advantageous terms that allow us to
operate our advertising platforms, we may be unable to maintain or expand our network coverage and
our business and prospects may be harmed; a significant portion of our revenues has been derived
from the five largest airports and three largest airlines in China, and if any of these airports or
airlines experiences a material business disruption, our ability to generate revenues and our
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected; our limited operating history
makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations; and
other risks outlined in AirMedia’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
AirMedia does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as
required under applicable law.
