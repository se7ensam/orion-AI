For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010
(millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)


The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Agrium Inc. (the Company) as at
September 30, 2010, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 have been prepared

principles applicable in the United States and from practices prescribed by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. GAAP).


The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s 2009 audited
consolidated financial statements and the Company’s unaudited consolidated interim financial
statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, prepared in accordance with
Canadian GAAP.

DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES







    a)
     
    U.S. GAAP requires measurement at fair value of stock-based compensation plans classified as liabilities. Such liabilities under Canadian GAAP are measured at intrinsic value. The Company estimates the fair value of liabilities for employee stock-based compensation plan awards using an option pricing model for awards with a service condition, and a Monte Carlo simulation model for awards with service and market conditions.



     

    b)
     
    Acquisition-related costs are excluded from the purchase price in a business combination and are expensed as incurred under U.S. GAAP. Under Canadian GAAP, such amounts are included in the purchase price. During the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2010, acquisition-related costs of $2-million that were capitalized under Canadian GAAP were expensed under U.S. GAAP. In addition, during the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, acquisition-related costs of $45-million, previously capitalized under Canadian GAAP, were expensed upon expiry of our offer to acquire CF Industries Holdings Ltd. Under U.S. GAAP, these costs had been expensed when incurred.



     

    c)
     
    U.S. GAAP requires recognition of stripping costs directly as a component of the cost of inventory produced each period. Under Canadian GAAP, the Company capitalizes and amortizes stripping costs.



     

    d)
     
    U.S. GAAP requires recognition of the funded status of pension and other post-retirement defined benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in that funded status recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) in the period they occur. Canadian GAAP does not require similar treatment.



     

    e)
     
    Joint ventures – Under U.S. GAAP, interests in a joint venture where the venturer does not control the joint venture are to be accounted for using the equity method. Under Canadian GAAP, such joint ventures are proportionately consolidated when joint control exists. As permitted by specific exemptions provided by the SEC, adjustments to reflect the application of equity accounting have not been made. Application of the
equity method would not result in differences to shareholders’ equity or net earnings.



     

    f)
     
    U.S. GAAP uses a more-likely-than-not threshold to determine recognition of uncertain tax positions. Canadian GAAP does not have a similar standard. U.S. GAAP also provides guidance that differs from Canadian requirements for classification, interest and penalties, and disclosure.



     

    g)
     
    U.S. GAAP requires disclosure on the face of the balance sheet of outstanding common shares issued and outstanding. The Company has unlimited authorized common share capital without par value.



     

    h)
     
    U.S. GAAP inventory reserves at September 30, 2010 were $nil (December 31, 2009 — $19-million).



     

    i)
     
    Reclassifications of certain items recorded under Canadian GAAP would be required under U.S. GAAP. The resulting presentation differences outlined below do not affect U.S. GAAP net earnings.

U.S. GAAP, such costs are presented as non-current assets.



     

     
    iii)
     
    Customer prepayments — As at September 30, 2010, customer prepayments in the amount of $286-million (December 31, 2009 — $529-million) are included within accounts payable and accrued liabilities under Canadian GAAP.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

adoption did not have a material impact on net earnings, financial position or cash flows.
Recently adopted pronouncements include:

financial assets, including clarification and amendments to the derecognition criteria for
transfers of financial assets to be accounted for as sales, and introduces new disclosures.


New Consolidation Guidance for Variable Interest Entities (VIE) — amends the consolidation guidance
for VIE including the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, a new
approach for determining whether a VIE should be consolidated, and changes to when it is necessary
to reassess consolidation of a VIE. Additional guidance changes the requirements for derecognizing
financial assets and requires enhanced disclosure.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted


Multiple-deliverable
Revenue Arrangements — addresses how to separate deliverables and how to
measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The Company
