AEGON announces the appointment of Clare Bousfield as Chief Financial Officer of AEGON UK. Ms. Bousfield has been with Swiss Re since 2001, where she
has held a number of roles which include her most recent position as Head of Group Audit based in Zurich. She takes up her new responsibilities in September 2010. 
Ms. Bousfield succeeds Bill Robertson who has decided to leave AEGON following a career spanning ten years in a variety of roles in Edinburgh and
The Hague.  Ms. Bousfield began her career at PricewaterhouseCoopers where she worked with clients in the UK insurance and investment

 Ms. Bousfield graduated in Statistics from the University of St. Andrews and completed the Advanced Management Program at leading French
management school INSEAD in 2009.  Jan Nooitgedagt, Member of the Management Board and AEGON’s CFO said, “We are delighted to have
attracted a person of Clare Bousfield’s caliber. Her broad international experience in finance and the insurance sector will be invaluable as we adapt to the changing landscape for our business. Clare’s appointment, together with that of
the newly-appointed Chief Operating Officer Adrian Grace and newly-appointed Chief Risk Officer Charles Garthwaite, comprises a strong team in the UK under the leadership of Otto Thoresen. We are grateful to Bill Robertson for his many years of
service and innumerable contributions to AEGON during the past ten years. We wish him every success in his new endeavors.”  Clare
Bousfield said, “I am delighted to be joining AEGON UK in the role of CFO. It’s an important time for the insurance sector with a changing economic and regulatory environment and I’m looking forward to working with the team to make
the most of the opportunities ahead.”
