following the turn-around in our business. Our strong operating leverage will allow us to improve

Total revenues for the third quarter of 2010 reached US$60.6 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 60.6% from US$37.7 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 7.6% from US$56.3
million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from digital frames
in airports, traditional media in airports, other media, digital TV screens on airplanes and the
gas station media network. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to increases in
revenues from digital frames in airports, digital TV screens in airports, and the gas station media
network.


Revenues from digital frames in airports



Revenues from digital frames in airports for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 82.5%
year-over-year and by 15.2% quarter-over-quarter to US$31.1 million. The year-over-year increase
was due to increases in both the number of time slots sold and the average advertising revenue per
time slot sold (the “ASP”). The quarter-over-quarter increase was due to an increase in the number
of time slots sold, which was partially offset by a decrease in the ASP. Please refer to “Summary
of Selected Operating Data” below for detailed definitions of the operating data cited in this
press release.


The number of time slots sold for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 74.7% year-over-year and
by 44.2% quarter-over-quarter to 14,301 time slots. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter
increases were due to continued sales efforts and growing acceptance of AirMedia’s digital frames.
AirMedia’s digital frames were in operation in 34 airports in the third quarter of 2010, up from 31
airports at the end of the third quarter of 2009 and 33 airports at the end of the second quarter
of 2010. The number of time slots available for sale for the third quarter of 2010 increased by
19.4% year-over-year and by 5.6% quarter-over-quarter to 34,538 time slots. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily due to an increase in the number of airports in
AirMedia’s digital frame network. The utilization rate of digital frames for the third quarter of
2010 increased by 13.1 percentage points year-over-year and 11.1 percentage points
quarter-over-quarter to 41.4%. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily
due to the increases in the number of time slots sold, which were partially offset by the increases
in the number of time slots available for sale.


The ASP of digital frames for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 4.5% year-over-year and
decreased by 20.1% quarter-over-quarter to US$2,177. The year-over-year increase was primarily due
to the change in the mix of time slots sold. The number of time slots sold in the top three
airports, which have significantly higher ASPs than those sold in other airports, accounted for a
higher percentage of total number of time slots sold in the third quarter of 2010 than in the
same period one year ago. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to higher discounts
offered in the third quarter of 2010 than in the previous quarter.

Revenues from digital TV screens in airports



Revenues from digital TV screens in airports for the third quarter of 2010 decreased by 13.3%
year-over-year and increased by 11.4% quarter-over-quarter to US$7.3 million. The year-over-year
decrease was due to a decrease in the ASP of digital TV screens in the airports, which was
partially offset by an increase in the number of time slots sold. The quarter-over-quarter increase
was primarily due to an increase in the number of time slots sold, which was partially offset by a
decrease in the ASP of digital TV screens in airports.


The number of time slots sold for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 10.7% year-over-year and
by 17.2% quarter-over-quarter to 6,264 time slots. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter
increases were primarily due to continued sales efforts. The number of time slots available for
sale for the third quarter of 2010 decreased by 6.1% year-over-year and increased by 4.9%
quarter-over-quarter to 24,064 time slots. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the
termination of operation of digital TV screens in certain second-tier and third-tier airports. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was due to commencement of operations of digital TV screens in Dalian
Zhoushuizi International Airport. The utilization rate for the third quarter of 2010 increased by
3.9 percentage points year-over-year and by 2.7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 26.0%.
The year-over-year increase was due to the increase in the number of time slots sold and the
decrease in the number of time slots available for sale. The quarter-over-quarter increase was due
to the increase in the number of time slots sold, which was partially offset by the increase in the
number of time slots available for sale.


The ASP of digital TV screens in airports for the third quarter of 2010 decreased by 21.7 %
year-over-year and by 5.0% quarter-over-quarter to US$1,165. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter decreases were primarily due to higher discounts offered in the third quarter
of 2010 than in the same period one year ago and in the previous quarter.


Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes



Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 29.3%
year-over-year and decreased by 10.8% quarter-over-quarter to US$5.2 million. The year-over-year
increase was due to increases in both the number of time slots sold and the ASP of digital TV
screens on airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the ASP
of digital TV screens on airplanes.


The number of time slots sold for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 20.2% year-over-year and
decreased by 1.2% quarter-over-quarter to 256 time slots. The year-over-year increase was due to
continued sales efforts. The number of time slots available for sale for the third quarter of 2010
decreased by 7.6% year-over-year and increased by 5.1% quarter-over-quarter to 416 time slots. The
year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the termination of our operation of digital TV screens
on the airplanes of China United Airlines and less advertising time on Air China’s airplanes. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the commencement of operations digital TV
screens on Hainan Airlines’ airplanes on August 1, 2010. The utilization rate for the third quarter
of 2010 increased by 14.2 percentage points year-over-year and decreased by 3.9 percentage points
quarter-over-quarter to 61.5%. The year-over-year increase was due to the increase in the number of
time slots sold and the decrease in the number of time slots available for sale. The
quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to the increase in the number of time slots
available for sale.


The ASP of digital TV screens on airplanes for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 7.6%
year-over-year and decreased by 9.7% quarter-over-quarter to US$20,467. The year-over-year increase
in the ASP was primarily due to lower discounts offered in the third quarter of 2010 than
in the same period one year ago and the increase in the listing prices of digital TV screens on Air
China’s airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in the ASP was primarily due to higher
discounts offered in the third quarter of 2010 than in the previous quarter.

Revenues from traditional media in airports



Revenues from traditional media in airports for the third quarter of 2010 primarily included
revenues from traditional media in Beijing Capital International Airport, Shenzhen International
Airport and Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport, as well as revenues from billboards and painted
advertisements on gate bridges in certain airports. Revenues from traditional media in airports for
the third quarter of 2010 increased by 65.3% year-over-year and decreased by 1.4%
quarter-over-quarter to US$12.1 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to continued
sales efforts and growing acceptance of AirMedia’s traditional media in airports. The
quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the ASP of traditional media in
airports.


The number of locations sold for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 34.0% year-over-year and
5.7% quarter-over-quarter to 481 locations primarily due to continued sales efforts. The number of
locations available for sale for the third quarter of 2010 decreased by 25.4% year-over-year and
increased by 6.4% quarter-over-quarter to 750 locations. The year-over-year decrease was primarily
because AirMedia terminated the operation of certain unprofitable traditional media in Beijing
Capital International Airport as well as billboards and painted advertisements on gate bridges in
certain airports in the first quarter of 2010. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due
to the commencement of operations of light boxes in Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport. The
utilization rate of traditional media for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 28.4 percentage
points year-over-year to 64.1% and remained relatively unchanged from the previous quarter. The
year-over-year increase was due to the decrease in the number of locations available for sale and
the increase in the number of locations sold.


The ASP of traditional media in airports for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 23.3%
year-over-year and decreased by 6.7% quarter-over-quarter to US$25,093. The year-over-year increase
was primarily due to more locations with higher listing prices sold in the third quarter of 2010
than in the same period one year ago. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to more
locations with lower listing prices sold in the third quarter of 2010 than in the previous quarter.


Revenues from the gas station media network



Revenues from the gas station media network for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 40.8%
quarter-over-quarter to US$1.1 million.


As of October 24, 2010, AirMedia had installed its media, including scrolling light boxes and
billboards, in a total of 2,016 Sinopec gas stations, of which 215 are located in Beijing, 295 in
Shanghai, 105 in Shenzhen and the remaining 1,401 in 30 other cities.


Revenues from other media 



Revenues from other media were primarily revenues from Beijing AirMedia City Outdoor Advertising
Co., Ltd., a company AirMedia acquired in January 2010, which operates unipole signs and other
outdoor media across Beijing. Revenues from other media decreased 11.1% quarter-over-quarter to
US$2.6 million because AirMedia terminated the operations of several unipole signs at certain
locations in the third quarter of 2010.

Business tax and other sales tax



Business tax and other sales tax for the third quarter of 2010 were US$1.6 million, compared to
US$552,000 in the same period one year ago and US$1.2 million in the previous quarter. For purposes
of calculating the amount of business and other sales tax, concession fees are permitted to be
deducted from total revenues under applicable PRC tax law.


Net revenues



Net revenues for the third quarter of 2010 reached US$59.0 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 58.6% from US$37.2 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 7.1% from US$55.1
million.


Cost of Revenues



Cost of revenues for the third quarter of 2010 was US$49.4 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 30.8% from US$37.8 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 1.7% from US$48.6
million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in concession fees in
connection with the expansion of AirMedia’s business. The quarter-over-quarter increase was
primarily due to an increase in agency fees paid to third-party advertising agencies. Cost of
revenues as a percentage of net revenues in the third quarter of 2010 was 83.8%, compared to 101.7%
in the same period one year ago and 88.2% in the previous quarter.


AirMedia incurs concession fees to airports for placing and operating digital frames, digital TV
screens, traditional media and other displays in airports, to airlines for playing programs on
their digital TV screens, to Sinopec for placing outdoor media in its gas stations, and to other
media resources owners for placing unipole signs and other outdoor media across Beijing.


Concession fees for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 19.2% year-over-year to US$33.3 million
and remained relatively unchanged from the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase was
primarily due to newly signed or renewed concession rights contracts during the period. Concession
fees as a percentage of net revenues in the third quarter of 2010 was 56.4%, decreasing from 75.1%
in the same period one year ago and 60.4% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter decreases of concession fees as a percentage of net revenues were primarily
due to the fact that revenues continued to ramp up while incremental concession fees grew at a
slower pace than revenue growth. AirMedia has no intention to materially expand its media resources
in the near term until it has returned to strong and sustainable profitability.


Gross Profit/Loss 



Gross profit for the third quarter of 2010 was US$9.5 million, improving from gross loss of
US$628,000 in the same period one year ago and gross profit of US$6.5 million in the previous
quarter.


Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the third quarter of 2010 was 16.2%, compared to
gross loss as a percentage of net revenues of negative 1.7% in the same period one year ago and
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues of 11.8% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter improvements in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues were
primarily due to the increases in net revenues.

Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were US$9.7 million, representing a
year-over-year decrease of 8.5% from US$10.6 million and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 20.4%
from US$12.2 million.


Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2010 included share-based compensation expenses
of US$1.7 million, compared to share-based compensation expenses of US$1.7 million in the same
period one year ago and share-based compensation expenses of US$3.4 million in the previous
quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in share-based compensation expenses was primarily
attributable to a one-time share-based compensation expense of US$1.6 million in the second
quarter of 2010 arising from a re-pricing of stock options on June 30, 2010. The share-based
compensation expenses are expected to further to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the
fully vesting on July 2, 2010 and July 20, 2010, respectively, of stock options granted on July 2,
2007, and July 20, 2007, respectively, and the ending of the vesting period of stock options
granted on November 29, 2007.


Adjusted operating expenses (non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2010, which excluded share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, were US$7.1 million,
representing a year-over-year decrease of 11.9% from US$8.1 million and a quarter-over-quarter
decrease of 10.1% from US$7.9 million. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues
(non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2010 was 12.1%, compared to 21.7% in the same period one year
ago and 14.4% in the previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP
Adjusted Operating Expenses” for a reconciliation of operating expenses under U.S. GAAP to adjusted
operating expenses (non-GAAP).


Selling and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were US$4.6 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$613,000. This represented a year-over-year increase of
26.9% from US$3.6 million and remained relatively unchanged from the previous quarter. The
year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher sales commissions for direct sales staff and
higher expenses related to the expansion of the gas station media network.


General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were US$5.2 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$1.1 million. This represented a year-over-year decrease of
26.7% from US$7.0 million and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 32.9% from US$7.7 million. The
year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower bad-debt provisions and lower share-based
compensation expenses. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to lower share-based
compensation expenses, lower bad-debt provisions and decreased professional fees.


Income/Loss from Operations



Loss from operations for the third quarter of 2010 was US$189,000, as compared to loss from
operations of US$11.3 million in the same period one year ago and loss from operations of
US$5.8 million in the previous quarter.

Adjusted income from operations (non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2010, which excluded
share-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was
US$2.4 million, compared to adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) of US$8.7 million in the same period
one year ago and adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) of US$1.4 million in the previous
quarter. Adjusted operating margin (non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2010, which excluded the
effect of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was
4.1%, compared to negative 23.4% in the same period one year ago and negative 2.6% in the previous
quarter.


Please refer to the attached table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Loss from Operations to
Non-GAAP Adjusted Loss from Operations” for a reconciliation of loss from operations under U.S.
GAAP to adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP).


Income Tax Benefit/Expenses



Income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2010 was US$357,000, compared to income tax benefit of
US$875,000 in the same period one year ago and income tax expenses of US$19,000 in the previous
quarter.


Net Income/Loss Attributable to AirMedia’s Shareholders



Net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders for the third quarter of 2010 was
US$1.2 million, compared to net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$9.6 million in the same
period one year ago and net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$4.7 million in the
previous quarter. The basic and diluted net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS
for the third quarter of 2010 were both US$0.02, compared to basic and diluted net loss
attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.15 in the same period one year ago and
basic and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.07 in the
previous quarter.


Adjusted net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) for the third quarter of
2010, which is net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders excluding share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$3.8 million, compared
to adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) of US$7.0 million in the
same period one year ago and adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP)
of US$424,000 in the previous quarter. Basic and diluted adjusted net income attributable to
AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2010 were both US$0.06,
compared to basic and diluted adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS
(non-GAAP) of US$0.11 in the same period one year ago and basic and diluted adjusted net loss
attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) of US$0.01 in the previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table captioned “Reconciliation Of GAAP Net Income (Loss) and EPS To
Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and EPS” for a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable
to AirMedia’s shareholders and basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders per ADS under U.S. GAAP to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders (non-GAAP) and basic and diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP).


Cash, Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments



Other than restricted cash of US$1.5 million, cash and short-term investments totaled US$96.5
million as of September 30, 2010, compared to US$124.3 million as of December 31, 2009, and US$83.5
million as of June 30, 2010. The decrease in cash and short-term investments from December 31, 2009
was primarily due to the payment of prepaid concession fees under certain material concession
rights contracts. The increase in cash and short-term investments from June 30, 2010 was primarily
due to cash flow from operations.

Notes:


(1) We define a time slot as a 30-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital TV screens in
airports and digital TV screens on airplanes, which is shown during each advertising cycle on a
weekly basis in a given airport or on a monthly basis on the routes of a given airline,
respectively. Our airport advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a given
week in one-hour cycles and each hour of programming includes 25 minutes of advertising content,
which allows us to sell a maximum of 50 time slots per week. The number of time slots available for
sale for our digital TV screens in airports during the period presented is calculated by
multiplying the time slots available for sale per week per airport by the number of weeks during
the period presented when we had operations in each airport and then calculating the sum of all the
time slots available for sale for each of our network airports. The length of our in-flight
programs typically ranges from approximately 45 minutes to an hour per flight, approximately five
to 13 minutes of which consist of advertising content. The number of time slots available for sale
for our digital TV screens on airplanes during the period presented is calculated by multiplying
the time slots per airline per month by the number of months during the period presented when we
had operations on each airline and then calculating the sum of all the time slots available for
sale for each of our network airlines.


(2) We define a time slot as a 12-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital frames in
airports, which is shown during each standard advertising cycle on a weekly basis in a given
airport. Our standard airport advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a
given week in 10-minute cycles, which allows us to sell a maximum of 50 time slots per week. The
length of time slot and advertising program cycle of some digital frames in several airports are
different from the standard ones. The number of time slots available for sale for our digital
frames in airports during the period presented is calculated by multiplying the time slots per week
per airport by the number of weeks during the period presented when we had operations in each
airport and then calculating the sum of all the time slots available for each of our network
airports.


(3) Number of time slots sold refers to the number of 30-second equivalent advertising time units
for digital TV screens in airports and digital TV screens on airplanes or 12-second equivalent
advertising time units for digital frames in airports sold during the period presented.

(4) Utilization rate for digital TV screens in airports, digital TV screens on airplanes and
digital frames in airports refers to total time slots sold as a percentage of total time slots
available for sale during the relevant period.


(5) Average advertising revenue per time slot sold for digital TV screens in airports, digital TV
screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports is calculated by dividing our revenues derived
from digital TV screens in airports, digital TV screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports
respectively by the respective number of time slots sold.


(6) We define the number of locations available for sale in traditional media as the sum of (1) the
number of light boxes and billboards in Beijing, Shenzhen, Wenzhou and certain other airports
(light boxes and billboards), and (2) the number of gate bridges in certain airports (gate
bridges).


(7) The number of locations sold is defined as the sum of (1) the number of light boxes and
billboards sold and (2) the number of gate bridges sold. To calculate the number of light boxes and
billboards sold in a given airport, we first calculate the “utilization rates of light boxes and
billboards” in such airport by dividing the “total value of light boxes and billboards sold” in
such airport by the “total value of light boxes and billboards” in such airport. The “total value
of light box and billboard sold” in a given airport is calculated as the daily listing prices of
each light boxes and billboards sold multiplied by their respective number of days sold during the
period presented. The “total value of light boxes and billboards” in a given airport is calculated
as the sum of quarterly listing prices of all the light boxes and billboards during the period
presented. The number of light boxes and billboards sold in a given airport is then calculated as
the number of light boxes and billboards available for sale in such airport multiplied by the
utilization rates of light boxes and billboards in such airport. The number of gate bridges sold in
a given airport is counted based on the contracts.


(8) Utilization rate for traditional media in airports refers to total locations sold as a
percentage of total locations available for sale during the period presented.


(9) Average advertising revenue per location sold is calculated by dividing the revenues derived
from all the locations sold by the number of locations sold during the period presented.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



AirMedia’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of AirMedia’s
comparative operating performance and future prospects. AirMedia’s non-GAAP financial measures
exclude the following non-cash items: (1) share-based compensation expenses, and (2) amortization
of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by AirMedia’s management in
their financial and operating decision-making, because management believes they reflect AirMedia’s
ongoing business and operating performance in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period
comparisons. AirMedia’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful
information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating AirMedia’s operating
performance in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. Specifically, AirMedia
believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and
investors by excluding certain charges that the Company believes are not indicative of its core
operating results.


The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. They do not include all items of income and
expense that affect AirMedia’s income from operations. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies and, with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude
certain items under GAAP, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer to AirMedia.
Management compensates for these limitations by also considering AirMedia’s financial results as
determined in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to
be considered superior to, in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance
with US GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table
captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) and EPS and Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss)
and EPS”, “Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses” and
“Reconciliation of GAAP Loss from Operations to Non-GAAP Adjusted Income (Loss) from Operations”
set forth at the end of this release.

Safe Harbor Statement



This announcement contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“future,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “confident” and similar statements. Among other
things, the Business Outlook section and the quotations from management in this announcement, as
well as AirMedia Group Inc.’s strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements.
AirMedia may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its reports to
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press
releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or
employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about
AirMedia’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to: if advertisers or the viewing public do not accept,
or lose interest in, our air travel advertising network, we may be unable to generate sufficient
cash flow from our operating activities and our prospects and results of operations could be
negatively affected; we derive most of our revenues from the provision of air travel advertising
services, and any slowdown in the air travel advertising industry in China may materially and
adversely affect our revenues and results of operation; our strategy of expanding our advertising
network by building new air travel media platforms and expanding into traditional media in airports
may not succeed, and our failure to do so could materially reduce the attractiveness of our network
and harm our business, reputation and results of operations; if we do not succeed in our expansion
into gas station and other outdoor media advertising, our future results of operations and growth
prospects may be materially and adversely affected; if our customers reduce their advertising
spending or are unable to pay us in full, in part or at all for a period of time due to an economic
downturn in China and/or elsewhere or for any other reason, our revenues and results of operations
may be materially and adversely affected; we face risks related to health epidemics, which could
materially and adversely affect air travel and result in reduced demand for our advertising
services or disrupt our operations; if we are unable to retain existing concession rights contracts
or obtain new concession rights contracts on commercially advantageous terms that allow us to
operate our advertising platforms, we may be unable to maintain or expand our network coverage and
our business and prospects may be harmed; a significant portion of our revenues has been derived
from the five largest airports and three largest airlines in China, and if any of these airports or
airlines experiences a material business disruption, our ability to generate revenues and our
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected; our limited operating history
makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations; and other risks
outlined in AirMedia’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. AirMedia does not
undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under
applicable law.
