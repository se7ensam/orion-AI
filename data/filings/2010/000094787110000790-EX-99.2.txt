Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)





 

 

 

 

(1)  Accounting Principles, Procedures and the Presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements





(a)  Terminology, Form and Method of Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements





Advantest Corporation (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “Advantest”) prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).  U.S. GAAP is codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), which is the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities.

Advantest prepared the interim consolidated financial statements that accompany these notes in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in Advantest’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2010.

The interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all normal adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to provide a fair presentation of results for the interim periods presented.  This interim information should be read with the consolidated financial statements in Advantest’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2010.





(b)  Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission





The Company became listed on the New York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2001 (local time) by means of an issuance of American Depository Shares, and has been filing a Form 20-F (equivalent to the Annual Securities Report in Japan) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since the year ended March 31, 2002.  Advantest prepares the consolidated financial statements in its Form 20-F in accordance with U.S. GAAP.




(c)  Significant differences from the preparation of financial statements under Japanese GAAP




Of the accounting principles, procedures and method of presentation adopted by Advantest, the following is a brief summary description of the significant differences from the preparation of financial statements using the accounting principles, procedure and method of presentation under Japanese GAAP, as required under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan:




(i) Allowance for compensated absences

An allowance is provided for the right of employees to receive compensated absences in the future.




(ii) Accrued pension and severance costs

The funded status, which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, of pension plans is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.




(iii) Goodwill

Goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually.

(2) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices








  


(a)


Description of Business







Advantest manufactures and sells semiconductor and component test system products and mechatronics-related products such as test handlers and device interfaces.  Advantest also engages in research and development activities and provides maintenance and support services associated with these products.




Description of the business by segment is as follows:




The semiconductor and component test system segment provides customers with test system products for the semiconductor industry and the electronic parts industry.  Product lines provided in the semiconductor and component test system segment include test systems for memory semiconductors for memory semiconductor devices and test systems for SoC (“System-on-a-Chip”) semiconductors for non memory semiconductor devices.




The mechatronics system segment provides product lines such as test handlers, mechatronic-applied products for handling semiconductor devices, device interfaces that serve as interfaces with the devices that are measured and operations related to nano-technology products.




The services, support and others segment consists of comprehensive customer solutions provided in connection with the above segments, support services, equipment lease business and others.











  


(b)


Accounting Changes and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted







In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting guidance for revenue recognition under multiple-deliverable arrangements.  The guidance modifies the criteria for separating deliverables and allocating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements.  The allocation of revenue is based on estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price is available.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted.  The guidance is required to be adopted by Advantest in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2011.  Advantest is currently evaluating the timing and the effect that this adoption will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.




In October 2009, the FASB amended accounting guidance for software revenue recognition.  This guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements.  It provides guidance on how to determine which software, if any, relating to the tangible product would be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted.  The guidance is required to be adopted by Advantest in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2011.  Advantest is currently evaluating the timing and the effect that this adoption will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Equity securities consist primarily of stocks issues by Japanese listed companies.  Debt securities are redeemable at the option of Advantest, and have no contractual maturity.




No gross gains and losses were realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2010.




Net realized gains and losses of the sale of available-for-sale securities are based on the averaged cost method and are included in “other income (expense)” in the consolidated statements of operations, and “other” in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.




Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and the fair value of the related securities, aggregated by length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, were as follows:

Advantest maintains non-marketable equity securities, which are recorded at cost.  The carrying amounts of non-marketable equity securities were ¥3,427 million and ¥3,434 million at June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively.  For non-marketable equity securities which Advantest identified events or changes in circumstances that might have had significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investments, the fair value approximates the carrying value.  Advantest has not estimated the fair value of other non-marketable equity securities of ¥1,527 million and ¥1,417 million at June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively, since it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the investments.  It is because of the lack of readily determinable fair values and difficu
lty in estimating fair value without incurring excessive cost.








(5) Derivative Financial Instruments




Derivative

Advantest uses foreign exchange forward contracts and currency options to manage currency exposure, resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, on trade receivables.  However, these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting since they do not meet the hedging criteria specified in U.S. GAAP.




Foreign exchange contracts generally have terms of several months.  These contracts are used to reduce Advantest’s risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures.  Changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts are recognized in earnings under the caption of other income (expense).

Concentration of credit risk

Derivative financial instruments contain an element of risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.  However, Advantest minimizes risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to major international banks and financial institutions meeting established credit guidelines.  Management of Advantest does not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations and, therefore, does not expect to incur any losses due to counterparty default on its obligations.




Advantest generally does not require or place collateral for these derivative financial instruments.

(6) Fair Value Measurement




Disclosure about the fair value of Financial Instruments




The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of Advantest’s financial instruments at June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, except for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, other current assets, trade accounts payable and accrued expenses for which fair value approximate their carrying amounts.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

The carrying amounts of investment securities for which it is practicable to estimate fair value are included in the consolidated balance sheets under investment securities.  The carrying amounts of foreign exchange contracts are included in other current assets and other current liabilities.




The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments:




Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, other current assets, trade accounts payable and accrued expenses:  The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.




Available-for-sale securities:  The fair values of available-for-sale equity securities are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those investments.  The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities are based on unobservable inputs as the market for the assets was not active at the measurement date.




Foreign exchange contracts:  The fair value of foreign exchange contracts are estimated by obtaining quotes from financial institutions.

Fair Value Hierarchy




US GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Additionally the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value are prioritized into the following three levels:




Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.




Assets / Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

As of June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level are as follows:

The table does not include assets and liabilities which are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. Advantest’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value consist of available-for-sale debt and equity securities and foreign exchange contracts. Adjustments to fair value of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) except where losses are considered to be other than temporary, in which case the losses are recorded in impairment losses on investment securities. Changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts are recognized in earnings under the caption of other income (expense).




Changes in the Level 3 financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis for the three months ended June 30, 2010 are as follows:

(7) Income Taxes

As of June 30, 2009, the estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2009 differs from the 40.4 percent statutory income tax rate primarily due to the estimated net increases in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the effects of foreign tax rates.

As of June 30, 2010, the estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2010 differs from the 40.5 percent statutory income tax rate primarily due to effects of separate company income tax reporting positions and related impacts of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and effects of foreign income tax rates.
