Revision of earnings forecast for this period: Yes
    
      Advantest
did not report the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010
in late October of last year due to difficulty in forecasting trends in the
demand for semiconductors and investment plans for semiconductor related capital
expenditure.
      At this
time, Advantest is able to report the earnings forecast for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2010, taking into account trends in orders input received and
other factors in the third quarter.  Such earnings forecast is
reported above.

        In the
third quarter of FY2009, the global economy further advanced in the direction of
recovery from the downturn triggered by the 2008 financial crisis, with China,
India, and most of Asia continuing to post impressive growth.
        The
semiconductor industry also showed signs of recovery primarily driven by PC and
consumer electronics demand. Nearly all chip-makers posted improved results and
gradually resumed capital expenditures aimed at boosting productivity, which
they had put on hold during the downturn. Correspondingly, demand for
Advantest’s products trended robustly upwards, fueling continued sequential
gains in sales and orders.
        As a
result of these developments, orders input received was (Y) 18.7 billion (a
110.4% increase in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal
year, a 29.1% increase in comparison to the second quarter). Net sales were (Y)
12.9 billion (a 11.7% decrease in comparison to the corresponding period of the
previous fiscal year, a 15.5% increase in comparison to the second quarter). The
percentage of net sales to overseas customers was 76.7%, compared to 55.4% in
the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
        Although
net sales have increased since the second quarter, they are still not at the
level to reach profitability. Accordingly, Advantest recorded an operating loss
of (Y) 5.0 billion and net loss of (Y) 5.7 billion.

        In the
Semiconductor and Component Test Systems segment, primarily due to renewed
capital expenditures from an increasing number of semiconductor manufacturers,
orders have been increasing since the second quarter.
        In the
memory semiconductor test system, Advantest saw a growing number of inquiries
for test systems used to manufacture DDR3 DRAM, the memory devices used in
high-performance PCs.
        In
non-memory semiconductor test system, the same expectations around the high-end
PC market contributed to continuing robust orders for MPU test systems. Demand
for LCD driver IC test systems was also solid, reflecting the healthy LCD
television market.
        As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 12.1 billion (a 343.8%
increase in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year),
net sales were (Y) 7.2 billion (a 4.9% decrease in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year) and operating loss was (Y) 3.6
billion.

        In the
Services, Support and Others segment, orders and sales decreased compare to the
third quarter of FY2008, however, they recorded a robust recovery in
profitability for maintenance services, primarily due to higher equipment
utilization rates at semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
        As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 3.4 billion (a 29.3% decrease
in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), net
sales were (Y) 2.9 billion (a 42.9% decrease in comparison to the corresponding
period of the previous fiscal year) and operating income was (Y) 0.5 billion
(33.5 times in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal
year).
        
        With
respect to the qualitative information concerning the consolidated business
results for the first quarter and the second quarter of the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2010, please refer to “FY2009  First Quarter Consolidated
Financial Results” (reported on July 29, 2009) and “FY2009  Second

        2.  Analysis
of Financial Condition
        Total
assets at December 31, 2009 amounted to (Y) 185.1 billion, a decrease of (Y)
16.9 billion compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to decrease in cash and
cash equivalents. The amount of total liabilities was (Y) 37.6 billion, a
decrease of (Y) 0.8 billion compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to
increase in trade accounts payable and decrease in other accounts payable.
Stockholders’ equity was (Y) 147.5 billion. Equity to assets ratio was 79.7%, a
decrease of 1.3 percentage point from March 31, 2009.
        
        (Cash
Flow Condition)
        Cash and
cash equivalents held at December 31, 2009 were (Y) 89.4 billion, a decrease of
(Y) 13.3 billion from September 30, 2009. Significant cash flows during the
third quarter of this fiscal year and their causes are described
below.
        Net cash
used in operating activities was (Y) 6.3 billion (Net cash out flow (Y) 7.2
billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount
was primarily attributable to net loss of (Y) 5.7 billion.
        Net cash
used in investing activities was (Y) 7.8 billion (Net cash out flow (Y) 16.3
billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount
was primarily attributable to increase in short-term investments in the amount
of (Y) 7.1 billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount

      3.  Prospects
for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
      With the
prospect of the global economy having bottomed out, the semiconductor market is
once again beginning to expand. In such an operating environment, semiconductor
manufacturers plan capital expenditures, not only to increase production and
productivity, but also to develop process shrink technology for production of
next generation of devices.
      In this
operating environment, through Advantest’s corporate initiative “1000 Days,”
launched in July 2009, Advantest will focus to further improve its delivery
response time, and will continue to provide timely new solutions optimized for
current market needs. Advantest will also strive to develop new businesses
outside the semiconductor industry, and to improve its overall cost structure
with the goal of achieving profitability in the earliest possible
timeframe.
      For the
fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, Advantest forecasts sales of (Y) 52.0
billion, operating loss of (Y) 13.0 billion, loss before income taxes and equity
in loss of affiliated company of (Y) 11.5 billion, and net loss of (Y) 13.5
billion.

carryforwards, and the effects of valuation allowances for deferred tax
