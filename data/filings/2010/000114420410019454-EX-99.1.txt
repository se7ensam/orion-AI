      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM
       
      To the
Board of Directors of
      Evatech
CO., LTD.
       
      We have
audited the accompanying balance sheets of Evatech CO., LTD. (the "Company") as
of August 31, 2009, and the related statements of operations and the stockholder's equity for the year then ended, all
expressed in yen. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
      
      We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
Japan. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
      
      In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2009,
and the related statements of operations and the stockholder's equity for the
year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
Japan.

                1.
              
              
                The
      accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the assumption
      that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in the Note to the financial
      statements, the Company has incurred net loss of 1,251,435 yen thousand
      from operations and has a net capital deficiency of 1,185,800 yen thousand
      which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
      concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
      might result from the outcome of this
  uncertainty.
              
            
        
      
      
        
            
              
                2.
              
              
                As
      discussed in the Note to the financial statements, plan of civil
      rehabilitation was approved at a meeting of creditors held on October 26,
      2009, and then the Company received an authorization for this
      rehabilitation from the court.
              
            
        
      
      
        
            
              
                3.
              
              
                As
      discussed in the Note to the financial statements, the Company changed its
      method of computing inventory
valuation.

               Notes
      Concerning the Condition of the Corporation as a Going
    Concern
            
          
      
    
    
      Subsequent
to the beginning of the current business year (from September 1, 2008 to August
31, 2009) the company received an order on September 11, 2008 for a thin-film
solar battery manufacturing line, for which the company has been engaged in
research and development for three years, in the amount of 7.1 billion yen. The
order gave the company reason to believe that it could rebuild its business and
improve its financial structure. However, the contract for this large order was
defaulted on thereafter by the other party, and coupled with the company’s weak
financial which with we had been struggling for the past two years, resulted in
a cash flow situation that we could not sustain.  Consequently, the
company reached a resolution to file a motion for civil rehabilitation
proceedings during the Board of Directors meeting held on November 24, 2008. The
motion was filed on November 25, 2008 in Kyoto District Court, and was accepted
with a decision to initiate civil rehabilitation proceeding on December 15,
2008.
    
    
    
      Given the
circumstances, the company posted an ordinary loss for the term in the
amount of 735,750,000 yen, and a net loss for the term in the amount of
1,251,435,000 yen, for the current business year. The shareholders’ equity on
the balance sheet was a negative equity of 1,185,800,000 yen, making the
company’s financial position very questionable in the current business
year.
    
    
    
      On the
other hand, the company has established and is working on the following plan to
achieve speedy rehabilitation:
    
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Effective
      July 9, 2009, we exchanged a memorandum concerning capital investment with
      Liaoning Hi-Tech Energy Group Co., Ltd. of China, and are in the process
      of negotiating with said company to establish a capital investment
      agreement naming said company as the sponsor
  company.
            
          
      
    
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Immediately
      after execution of the agreement, the company will submit a rehabilitation
      plan to the Kyoto District Court in order to obtain the approval to
      proceed with the plan.
            
          
      
    
    
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              ·
            
            
              Thin-film
      and crystalline solar batteries are one of the most noteworthy energy
      sources in the world now, and the company believes that it will be able to
      receive orders as soon as the business is
  restored.
            
          
      
    
    
    However,
the issue is still under negotiation and yet to be finalized, and there is a
material uncertainty about the conditions for continuing the
corporation.  The financial statements are prepared under the
assumption that the corporation will be going concern, and they do not reflect
the impact from the material uncertainty concerning the conditions of continuing
the corporation.

    (Change
in Accounting Policy)
    In the
past, inventory for ordinary selling purposes had be valued mainly by the cost
method. Starting in
the current business year, however, they are computed at the cost method (for
the amount stated in the balance sheets, the devalued book value method under
declining profitability) in accordance with the implementation of “Accounting
Standards Concerning Inventory Valuation” (Corporate Accounting Standards No. 9,
July 5, 2006). The impact of the change is an increase of 55 million yen in the
net loss for the term before tax for the current business year.

      company reevaluated its usage of assets upon 2008’s amendment of the
      Corporate Tax Law, and subsequently changed the useful life of machinery
      and facilities starting with the current business year.  As a
      result, the operating profit, ordinary profit, and net profit for the term
      before tax each declined by 2,890,000 yen in comparison with the previous

      the accumulated depreciation amounted to 5% based on the revision of
      corporate tax law.
