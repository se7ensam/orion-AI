Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, Inc., said,
“In light of the challenges we faced and overcame in 2009, we were especially pleased to end the
year on a high note by achieving record profit in the fourth quarter. We have observed a
strengthening trend in market conditions and believe our online business in particular has carried

business is well positioned to not only extend our geographic reach and addressable employer base,
but also streamline our service network for greater efficiency and margin expansion. We believe

Fourth Quarter 2009 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009 were RMB226.0 million (US$33.1
million), an increase of 15.2% from RMB196.2 million for the same quarter in 2008.


Print advertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 8.2% to RMB64.6 million (US$9.5
million) compared with RMB59.7 million for the same quarter in 2008. The increase was primarily
due to higher average revenue per page, which was partially offset by a lower volume of print
advertising pages in 51job Weekly resulting from a decline in market demand. Although print
advertising prices in each city remained relatively unchanged, overall average revenue per page
increased 39.8% over the fourth quarter of 2008 due to an increase in page volume contribution from
cities where print advertising prices are generally higher as compared to the same quarter of the
prior year. The estimated number of print advertising pages generated in the fourth quarter of
2009 decreased 22.6% to 2,672 compared with 3,452 pages in the same quarter in 2008.


Online recruitment services revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 were RMB97.3 million (US$14.2
million), representing a 33.7% increase from RMB72.7 million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The increase primarily resulted from a greater number of unique employers using the
Company’s online recruitment services, which was partially offset by lower average revenue per
unique employer. Unique employers increased 66.4% to 94,993 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared
with 57,071 in the same quarter of the prior year driven by greater customer acceptance and usage
of online recruitment services. Average revenue per unique employer decreased 19.7% in the fourth
quarter of 2009 due to employers purchasing lower priced products and/or reducing their overall
spending on online services as compared to the same quarter in 2008.


Other human resource related revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 0.5% to RMB64.1
million (US$9.4 million) from RMB63.8 million in the same quarter of 2008.


Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 42.1% to RMB134.3 million (US$19.7 million)
from RMB94.5 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is equal to gross
profit divided by net revenues, expanded to 62.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 51.0%
in the same quarter in 2008 primarily due to lower printing related and other direct expenses
resulting from the implementation of cost control and efficiency measures in 2009.


Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 were RMB92.5 million (US$13.6 million) compared
with RMB88.6 million for the same quarter of 2008. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues decreased to 43.2% for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 47.8% for the fourth
quarter of 2008.


Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 8.4% to RMB63.1 million
(US$9.2 million) from RMB58.2 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to
increased commissions resulting from higher sales, which were partially offset by lower travel and
entertainment expenses as compared to the same quarter in 2008.


General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 3.2% to RMB29.4
million (US$4.3 million) from RMB30.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower
office expenses and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher rental and
depreciation expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.


Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased to RMB41.7 million (US$6.1 million)
from RMB5.9 million for the same quarter of the prior year. During the fourth quarter of 2009, one
of the Company’s main subsidiaries received notification from relevant tax authorities that it had
qualified as a High Technology Enterprise under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, which
reduced its tax rate for 2009 from 20% to 15% in Shanghai and from 25% to 15% in other localities.
The cumulative impact of this tax change resulted in an effective tax rate of 1.0% in the fourth
quarter of 2009.


Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased to RMB46.4 million (US$6.8 million) from RMB6.8
million for the same quarter in 2008. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the fourth
quarter of 2009 were RMB0.84 (US$0.12) compared with RMB0.12 for the same quarter in 2008. Fully
diluted earnings per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2009 were RMB1.67 (US$0.24) compared with
RMB0.24 in the fourth quarter of 2008.


In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB6.2 million (US$0.9 million) compared with RMB7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation loss of RMB37,000 (US$5,000) in the fourth
quarter of 2009 compared with a translation gain of RMB0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.


Excluding share-based compensation expense and the impact of foreign currency translation loss,
non-GAAP adjusted income for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased to RMB52.6 million (US$7.7
million) compared with RMB13.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully
diluted earnings per common share were RMB0.95 (US$0.14) in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared
with RMB0.24 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per ADS in
the fourth quarter of 2009 were RMB1.90 (US$0.28) compared with RMB0.48 in the fourth quarter of
2008.


Fiscal Year 2009 Unaudited Financial Results


Total revenues for 2009 were RMB817.1 million (US$119.7 million), a decrease of 5.0% from RMB860.4
million in 2008 as a result of the impact of the global financial crisis on market demand.
However, due to the implementation of cost control, realignment and efficiency measures, income
from operations for 2009 increased 24.3% to RMB120.3 million (US$17.6 million) from RMB96.8 million
for 2008.


The estimated number of print advertising pages generated in 2009 decreased 29.4% to 11,661
compared with 16,512 estimated pages in 2008. Unique employers using the Company’s online
recruitment services grew 39.9% to 143,451 in 2009 from 102,562 in 2008. Employers who purchase
online services multiple times or in multiple quarters throughout the fiscal year are counted as
one unique employer for the annual total.


Net income for 2009 increased 46.9% to RMB112.5 million (US$16.5 million) from RMB76.6 million in
2008. Fully diluted earnings per common share for 2009 increased to RMB2.02 (US$0.30) from RMB1.35
in 2008. Fully diluted earnings per ADS for 2009 were RMB4.03 (US$0.59) compared with RMB2.70 in
2008.


Excluding share-based compensation and foreign currency translation loss, non-GAAP adjusted net
income for 2009 increased to RMB139.8 million (US$20.5 million) from RMB121.8 million in 2008.
Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB2.51 (US$0.37) in 2009 compared
with RMB2.15 in 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per ADS in 2009 were RMB5.01
(US$0.73) compared with RMB4.29 in 2008.


In September 2008, the Company announced that its shareholders had approved a share repurchase
program authorizing the repurchase of up to US$25 million worth of outstanding ADSs. In the fourth
quarter of 2009, the Company repurchased 51,422 ADSs, representing 102,844 common shares, in the
open market for an aggregate consideration of US$0.7 million, including transaction fees. Since
the inception of this share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased a total of 846,027
ADSs, representing 1,692,054 common shares, for an aggregate consideration of US$7.8 million.


As of December 31, 2009, the Company had cash and short-term investments totaling RMB1,214.7
million (US$178.0 million) compared with RMB1,074.4 million at December 31, 2008. Short-term
investments consist of certificates of deposit held by the Company in banking institutions in
China.


Business Outlook


For the first quarter of 2010, based on current market and operating conditions, the Company’s
revenue target is in the estimated range of RMB230 million to RMB240 million (US$33.7 million to
US$35.2 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense and any foreign currency translation
loss or gain, the Company’s non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the first quarter of 2010 is
in the estimated range of RMB0.68 to RMB0.78 per common share (US$0.20 to US$0.23 per ADS). The
Company expects aggregate share-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2010 to be in
the estimated range of RMB6 million to RMB7 million (US$0.9 million to US$1.0 million).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of adjusted net
income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from
results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and foreign
currency translation gain or loss. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company’s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company’s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss from its non-GAAP
financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation gain or loss is
unrelated to the Company’s core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor
impact the Company’s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP measures excluding
share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss are important in
helping investors to understand the Company’s current financial performance and future prospects
and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The
presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to
GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The
non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.
