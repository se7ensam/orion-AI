 Operating Review 
Second Quarter  Territory 1:
 Acergy Northern Europe and Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $121.1 million
(Q2 2009: $130.6 million) reflecting the ongoing challenging market environment and fewer projects in installation phase, partly offset by good operational progress on a number of projects including the DSVi frame agreement, DONG Trym, BP Skarv and
Deep Panuke. Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $5.0 million (Q2 2009: net operating loss of $4.5 million) reflecting lower activity levels due to prevailing market conditions, lower vessel utilisation and the
rescheduling of certain vessels for upcoming offshore operations. These factors were partially offset by the recognition of variation orders. Commercial negotiations on the Marathon Volund Project continue. 
Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $81.3 million (Q2 2009: $53.7 million)
reflecting good progress on the Pluto Project. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $41.3 million (Q2 2009: $14.9 million) reflecting the successful completion of offshore operations on the Pluto and Pyrenees Projects,
partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations.  Territory 2: 
Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $316.1 million (Q2 2009: $207.9
million) reflecting continued good operational progress on a number of major projects: Angola LNG, EPC4A, Block 15 and PazFlor, and a good contribution from Sonamet, which remained fully consolidated during the quarter although is classified as an
asset held for sale. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $83.1 million (Q2 2009: $41.1 million) due to good operational performance across the project portfolio, including Block 15, EPC4A, Angola LNG, PazFlor and
Sonamet.  Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.4 million (Q2
2009: $29.2 million). Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $5.2 million (Q2 2009: net operating income of $8.1 million) as a result of the segment’s operating cost base which was not covered by project activity.
 Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $60.3 million (Q2 2009: $100.7
million) reflecting lower activity levels due to the completion of the Frade SURF Project. This was partly offset by the four ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras, which achieved full utilisation during the quarter outside of planned
dry-dock and the contribution from the Roncador Manifold Project. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $3.5 million (Q2 2009: $10.3 million) reflecting lower activity levels partly offset by strong performance from
Acergy Condor, Pertinacia and Polar Queen.  Acergy Corporate: 
Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $1.7 million (Q2 2009: $3.4 million). Net operating loss from continuing operations for the
quarter was $24.0 million (Q2 2009: net operating income of $11.1 million) primarily due to the lower utilisation of corporate vessels, including Acergy Eagle and Acergy Falcon and reflects the transfer of the Polar Queen from
the Acergy Corporate segment to Acergy South America. Professional fees arising from the proposed combination, foreign exchange losses and ongoing legal restructuring and organisational optimisation were partially offset by positive contributions
from the SHL and NKT Flexibles joint ventures.  Discontinued operations 
Net income from discontinued operations for the second quarter was $4.5 million (Q2 2009: $0.9 million) due to the positive contribution from the Mexilhao
Trunkline Project.  Asset Development 
The Sonamet joint venture remained fully consolidated as at May 31, 2010 although it continues to be classified as ‘Assets held for sale’.
After the completion of the sale and transfer of shares the business will be deconsolidated from Acergy’s financials and its future results will be reported as share of results of associates and joint ventures.

 As part of the ongoing fleet development programme, Acergy has acquired two vessels, post quarter end.
Firstly, the acquisition of Antares, a new shallow water barge for the Conventional market for pipelay and hook-up projects in West Africa. Secondly, the acquisition of Polar Queen, a flexible pipelay and subsea construction ship which
joined the fleet in 2006 on long-term charter, and which is currently on a long-term service agreement with Petrobras in Brazil.  Toisa
Proteus was returned to her owner following the successful completion of offshore operations on the Pluto Project.  Financial Review
 Second Quarter 
Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter was $581 million (Q2 2009: $526 million) primarily reflecting good activity levels in West
Africa and Asia Pacific, which were partially offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea, Brazil and Gulf of Mexico.  Gross profit was
$163 million (Q2 2009: $128 million) due to higher activity levels and a strong operating performance driven by good project execution, particularly in West Africa and Asia Pacific. 
Administrative expenses were $74 million (Q2 2009: $55 million) due to the effect of foreign currency translation, higher professional fees arising from
the proposed combination with Subsea 7 Inc., ongoing legal restructuring and organisational optimisation and higher tendering costs. 
Acergy’s share of results of associates and joint ventures was $4 million (Q2 2009: $9 million) reflecting a positive consolidated contribution from
NKT Flexibles, Seaway Heavy Lifting and SapuraAcergy.  The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the three months was 20.9%
(Q2 2009: 21.5%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 21.9% (Q2 2009: 21.1%).  Other gains and losses
was a gain of $5 million (Q2 2009: $8 million) primarily reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation on short-term Euro inter-company and cash balances and realised hedging losses arising from the weakened Euro in the quarter. 
Income before taxes from continuing operations for the second quarter was $95 million (Q2 2009: $85 million) primarily reflecting a strong operational
performance across the project portfolio. This was partly offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea, Brazil and Gulf of Mexico, lower vessel utilisation, and higher administrative expenses. 
Taxation for the quarter was $32 million (Q2 2009: $9 million) resulting in an effective tax rate for the quarter of 34% (Q2 2009: 11%) reflecting the
current geographical portfolio mix of our business. The effective tax rate for Q2 2009 reflects the release of certain provisions following the resolution of a number of audits during that quarter. 
Income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $63 million (Q2 2009: $76 million). Net income from total operations for the second quarter
was $67 million (Q2 2009: $77 million).  The cash and cash equivalents position at the quarter end was $631 million (February 28 2010: $667
million) reflecting working capital outflows and the capital expenditure on Acergy Borealis, which will be funded entirely from the Company’s existing cash resources. Deferred revenue at the quarter end stood at $227 million (February
28, 2010: $232 million).  At May 31, 2010, Acergy S.A. held directly 10,537,524 treasury shares representing 5.41% of the total number of
issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares, of which 573,000 are held in an employee benefit trust to support the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Total shares in issue
were 194,953,972, including treasury shares.

 Backlog 
Backlog for continuing operations as at May 31, 2010 was approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $0.9 billion is expected to be executed
in the fiscal year 2010. This figure does not include backlog related to associates and joint ventures.

Trading Outlook  The more stable oil
price and strong tendering continues to underpin confidence in our business. However, for shorter-term work, particularly in the North Sea, the pricing environment remains competitive, and is likely to continue to impact margins in 2011. 
Activity in the Conventional market in West Africa is expected to remain strong in the short and medium-term. A number of the major SURF contracts,
delayed during 2009, are still expected to come to market award in the second half of 2010. The offshore installation phase of these new SURF projects will commence beyond 2011. 
We believe the trend will be for SURF projects to continue to increase in size and complexity which will contribute to substantial industry growth in the
medium-term. We are well placed to combine our competitive strengths of high calibre engineering and project management skills with our high quality assets to capture these growth opportunities.

(a)

Adjusted
 EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing
operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing
operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the
performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use
in the European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as they eliminate the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a
useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the
Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings
made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative
to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity.
The reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this release. This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing
operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating
companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations. 
 Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These statements include,
but are not limited to, statements as to the approximate value of the contract award, expectations as to the Group’s performance in 2010, the continued commercial negotiations relating to the Marathon Volund Project, the impact of the sale and
deconsolidation of the Sonamet joint venture, the funding of Acergy Borealis, expectations regarding our backlog and pre-backlog, statements contained in the “Trading Outlook” section, including our visibility for 2010 and 2011, the
expected impact of a continued competitive pricing environment, the anticipated activity levels in the Conventional market in West Africa, the anticipation that delayed major SURF contracts will come to market and the timing of the offshore
installation phase of such projects, the expectation for SURF contracts to increase in size and complexity in the medium-term and our ability to capture growth opportunities. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions
and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results and
trends to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: actions by regulatory authorities or other third parties; unanticipated costs and difficulties related to the integration of Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7 Inc. and our ability to achieve
benefits therefrom; unanticipated delays, costs and difficulties related to the combination transaction, including satisfaction of closing conditions; our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and
competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely
delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or
predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.  This communication does not constitute
an offer to purchase, sell, or exchange or the solicitation of an offer to sell, purchase, or exchange any securities of Subsea 7 or Acergy.
