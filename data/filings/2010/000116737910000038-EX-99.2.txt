Selling Shareholder desires to sell Registrable Securities in an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to a Demand Registration Statement filed under this Section 2,
the underwriter(s), including the managing underwriter(s), shall be selected by
the Selling Shareholder, which underwriter(s) and managing underwriter(s) shall

    5

permitted to offer securities under any Demand Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this Section 2 unless the Selling Shareholder consents in
writing.
     
    3. Incidental
Registration.  (a)  If at any time the Company
proposes to register under the Securities Act any Common Shares whether or not
for sale for its own account (and not solely in connection with a sale of
warrants or other rights to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, Common Shares and other than (x) any registration
relating to any employee benefit or similar plan, any dividend reinvestment
plan, or any acquisition by the Company or (y) pursuant to a registration
statement filed in connection with an exchange offer), the Company shall give
written notice to the Selling Shareholder at least 20 calendar days prior to the
initial filing of a registration statement with the SEC pertaining thereto (an
“Incidental
Registration Statement”) informing the Selling Shareholder of its intent
to file such Incidental Registration Statement and of the Selling Shareholder’s
right under this Section 3 to request the registration of the Registrable
Securities held by the Selling Shareholder.  Upon the written request
of the Selling Shareholder made within 10 calendar days after any such notice is
received (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities intended to be
disposed of by the Selling Shareholder and the intended method of distribution
thereof), the Company shall use its best efforts to effect the registration
under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Company has
been so requested to register by the Selling Shareholder, to the extent required
to permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities so requested to be
registered (including, if necessary, by filing with the SEC a post-effective
amendment or a supplement to the Incidental Registration Statement or the
related prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or by
filing any other required document or otherwise supplementing or amending the
Incidental Registration Statement, if required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form under the Securities Act used
by the Company for such Incidental Registration Statement or by the Securities
Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder).
     
    (b) If a
registration pursuant to this Section 3 involves an Underwritten Offering and
the underwriter or the managing underwriter(s), as the case may be, of such
Underwritten Offering shall inform the Company and the Selling Shareholder on or
before the date five days prior to the date then scheduled for such offering,
that, in its opinion, the amount of securities requested to be included in such
registration exceeds the amount which can be sold in (or during the time of)
such offering within a proposed price range without adversely affecting the
distribution of the securities being offered, then the Company will include in
such registration only the amount of Registrable Securities and other securities
that the underwriter or managing underwriter(s), as the case may be, has advised
can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering within such price range;
provided, however, that the
Company shall be required to include in such required
registration:  first, all the
securities initially proposed to be sold pursuant to such Incidental
Registration Statement by the Company (in the case of a primary offering by the
Company) and second, the amount of
Registrable Securities and other securities requested to be included in such
registration that the Company is so advised can be sold in (or during the time
of) such offering, allocated pro rata among the Selling Shareholder
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
    6
     
    and other
securityholders of the Company requesting such registration on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities and other securities requested to be included
by such other securityholders.
     
    (c) Nothing
in this Section 3 shall create any liability on the part of the Company to the
Selling Shareholder if the Company in its sole discretion should decide not to
file an Incidental Registration Statement proposed to be filed pursuant to
Section 3 or to withdraw such registration statement subsequent to its
filing, regardless of any action whatsoever that the Selling Shareholder may
have taken, whether as a result of this issuance by the Company of any notice
hereunder or otherwise.
     
    4. Additional Rights of Selling
Shareholder.  (a)   At any time following the
date of this Agreement, the Selling Shareholder shall have the right to request
in writing (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities intended to
be disposed of and the intended method of distribution thereof) that the Company
register any or all of the Selling Shareholder’s Registrable Securities by
filing with the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities.  Upon the receipt of such a request, the Company shall,
not later than the 45th calendar day after the receipt of such a request, cause
to be filed a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the registration under
the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities which the Company has been so
requested to register by the Selling Shareholder, to the extent necessary to
permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended methods of distribution thereof specified in such request, and shall
use its best efforts to have such Shelf Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC or otherwise become effective as soon as practicable
thereafter (but in no event later than the 75th calendar day after the receipt
of such a request) and to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective during the period from the date a Shelf Registration Statement is
declared effective by the SEC or otherwise becomes effective as provided by the
Securities Act until such Shelf Registration Statement has been effective for
365 calendar days, exclusive of any and all Suspension Periods with respect to
such Shelf Registration Statement.
     
    (b) A
Suspension Period with respect to any Shelf Registration Statement shall
commence on and include the date that the Company gives notice that any Shelf
Registration Statement is no longer effective or usable for resales of
Registrable Securities of the Selling Shareholder to and including the date when
the Selling Shareholder covered by such Shelf Registration Statement either
receives the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus or issuer free
writing prospectus contemplated by Section 7(j) or is advised in writing by the
Company that the use of the prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus may be
resumed.
     
    (c) No
incidental or piggyback registration rights shall be available to any Person
(including the Company) with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement, and no
Person (including the Company) shall have the right to have any securities other
than the Registrable Securities included therein or registered
thereon.
     
    5. Registration
Expenses.  The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in
connection with each registration pursuant to Sections 2, 3 and 4, whether

Statement.  The Selling Shareholder shall pay all discounts and
commissions payable to underwriters, selling brokers, managers or other similar
Persons related to the sale or disposition of the Selling Shareholder’s
Registrable Securities pursuant to any Required Registration Statement or any
Incidental Registration Statement.  The Selling Shareholder shall be
responsible for the fees and legal expenses of any legal counsel, accountants or
other agents retained by Selling Shareholder and all other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Selling Shareholder in connection with any registration
under this Agreement.
     
    6. Restrictions on Public Sale
by Selling Shareholder and the Company.  (a)  If
requested by the underwriter or managing underwriter(s) in any Underwritten
Offering by the Selling Shareholder of Common Shares, each party hereto shall
agree not to effect any public sale or distribution of Common Shares during the
14-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the date of
sale of securities in connection with such Underwritten Offering (except
pursuant to such registration statement if the Selling Shareholder is entitled
to include securities in such registration statement).
     
    (b) If
requested by the underwriter or managing underwriter(s) in any Underwritten
Offering or by the Selling Shareholder in any offering pursuant to a Required

of any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares) during the
14-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the date of
sale of securities in connection with such offering.
     
    7. Registration

pursuant to Sections 2, 3 and 4, the Company shall use its best efforts to

notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of such
Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any
proceeding for such purpose and (iv) of the happening of any event during the
period a Required Registration Statement is required to be kept in effect as a
result of which such Registration Statement or the related prospectus or any

under which they were made, in the case of a prospectus);
     
    (f) furnish

    12
     
    Shareholder,

proposed distribution by the Selling Shareholder of such Registrable Securities
as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
     
    (b) Upon
receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind

discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the affected
Registration Statement until the Selling Shareholder’s receipt of the copies of
the supplemented or amended prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus
contemplated by Section 7(j), and, if so directed by the Company, the Selling
Shareholder shall deliver to the Company (at the expense of the Company) or
destroy all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in
the Selling Shareholder’s possession, of the prospectus or issuer free writing
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities which was current at the time of
receipt of such notice.
     
    (c) The
Selling Shareholder may not participate in any underwritten offering under
Section 2, 3 or 4 hereof unless it completes and executes all customary
questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, underwriting agreements
and other customary documents required under the customary terms of such
underwriting arrangements.  In connection with any underwritten
offering under Section 2, 3 or 4 hereof, the Selling Shareholder shall be a
party to the underwriting agreement with the underwriters and may be required to
make certain customary representatives and warranties and provide certain
customary indemnification for the benefit of the underwriters; provided that the
Selling Shareholder shall not be required to make representations and warranties
with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries or their business and
operations and shall not be required to agree to any indemnity or contribution
provisions less favorable to the Selling Shareholder than those set forth
herein.
     
    9. Indemnification.  (a)  The
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Shareholder and its
Affiliates, directors, officers and employees and each Person, if any, who
controls the Selling Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, as follows:
     
    (i) against
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and reasonable
expenses whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or
any amendment thereto) pursuant to which Registrable Securities were registered
under the Securities Act or any issuer free writing prospectus relating to such
Registrable Securities, including all documents incorporated therein by
reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact contained in any prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) including all documents incorporated
therein by reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
    13
     
    (ii) against
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and reasonable
expenses whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in
settlement of any litigation, investigation or proceeding by any governmental
agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any other claim whatsoever based
upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement
or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the
Company; and
     
    (iii) against
any and all reasonable expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to
Section 9(c), fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any litigation, investigation or proceeding by
any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, in each case whether
or not such Person is a party, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such
untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission,
to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii)
above;
     
    provided, however, that this
indemnity agreement does not apply with respect to any loss, liability, claim,
damage, judgment or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission (A) made in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Selling
Shareholder in writing for use in a Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or any related prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
any issuer free writing prospectus or (B) if such untrue statement or omission
or alleged untrue statement or omission was corrected in an amended or
supplemented Registration Statement, prospectus or issuer free writing
prospectus and the Company had furnished copies thereof to the Selling
Shareholder and any underwriter acting on its behalf from which the Person
asserting such loss, liability, claim, damage, judgment or expense purchased the
securities that are the subject thereof prior to the date of sale by such
underwriter or the Selling Shareholder to such Person.
     
    (b) Indemnification by Selling
Shareholder.  The Selling Shareholder shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, and its Affiliates, directors, officers and employees
(including each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement)
and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses described in the
indemnity contained in Section 9(a) (provided that any settlement of the type
described therein is effected with the written consent of the Selling
Shareholder) as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or
omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in a Registration
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Selling
Shareholder in writing for use in such Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or such prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any
issuer free writing prospectus; provided, however, that the
Selling Shareholder shall not be required to provide indemnification in any
amount in excess of the amount by which (x) the total price at which the
Registrable Securities sold by the Selling Shareholder and distributed to the
public were offered to the public exceeds (y) the amount of any damages which
the 
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
    14
     
    Selling
Shareholder has otherwise been required to pay and has paid by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission.  The Company shall be entitled, to the extent customary, to
receive indemnification and contribution from underwriters, selling brokers,
dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in
the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with respect to
information so furnished in writing by such Persons specifically for inclusion
in any prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus or Registration
Statement.
     
    (c) Conduct of Indemnification
Proceedings.  Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice
to each indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in
respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure so to notify an
indemnifying party or parties shall not relieve it or them from any liability
which it or they may have under this indemnity agreement, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give
notice.  If the indemnifying party or parties so elects within a
reasonable time after receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party or parties
may assume the defense of such action or proceeding at such indemnifying party’s
or parties’ expense with counsel chosen by the indemnifying party or parties and
approved by the indemnified party defendant in such action or proceeding, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that, if
such indemnified party or parties reasonably determine that a conflict of
interest exists and that therefore it is advisable for such indemnified party or
parties to be represented by separate counsel or that, upon advice of counsel,
there may be legal defenses available to it or them which are different from or
in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, then the indemnifying
party or parties shall not be entitled to assume such defense and the
indemnified party or parties shall be entitled to separate counsel (limited in
each jurisdiction to one counsel for all indemnified parties under this
Agreement) at the indemnifying party’s or parties’ expense.  If any
indemnifying party or parties is not so entitled to assume the defense of such
action or does not assume such defense, after having received the notice
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party or
parties will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified
party or parties (limited in each jurisdiction to one counsel for all
indemnified parties under this Agreement).  In such event, however, no
indemnifying party or parties will be liable for any settlement effected without
the written consent of such indemnifying party or parties (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If an indemnifying party is
entitled to assume, and assumes, the defense of such action or proceeding in
accordance with this paragraph, such indemnifying party or parties shall not,
except as otherwise provided in this subsection (c), be liable for any fees and
expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in
connection with such action or proceeding.
     
    (d) Contribution.  (i)  In
order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which
the indemnity agreement provided for in this Section 9 is for any reason held to
be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance
with its terms in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments
and expenses suffered by an indemnified party referred to therein, each
applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses in
such proportion as is 
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
    15
     
    appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Selling
Shareholder (including, in each case, that of their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents) on the other in connection with the statements
or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages,
judgments or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and
of the Selling Shareholder (including, in each case, that of their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents) on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by or on
behalf of the Selling Shareholder, on the other, and the parties’ relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as
a result of the losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses
referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred
by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or
claim.
     
    (ii) The
Company and the Selling Shareholder agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in sub-paragraph (i)
above.  Notwithstanding this Section 9(d), in the case of
distributions to the public, the Selling Shareholder shall not be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (A) the total price at
which the Registrable Securities sold by the Selling Shareholder and distributed
to the public were offered to the public exceeds (B) the amount of any damages
which the Selling Shareholder has otherwise been required to pay and has paid by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.
     
    (iii) For
purposes of this Section 9(d), each Person, if any, who controls the Selling
Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have
the same rights to contribution as the Selling Shareholder; and each director of
the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement,
and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Company.
     
    10. Inconsistent
Actions.  (a)  The Company shall not grant to any
other Person the right to include securities in any Required Registration
Statement, other than such rights granted in this Agreement.
     
    (b) The
Company shall not seek to include in any Required Registration Statement any
securities other than Registrable Securities held by the Selling
Shareholder.
     
    11. Assignment of Registrable
Securities.  (a)  The Selling Shareholder may
transfer all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to any direct or
indirect 
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
    16
     
    wholly
owned subsidiary of the Selling Shareholder (each transferee shall be referred
herein as a “Transferee”) in
respect of any number of Registrable Securities (“Permitted
Transfer”).  Any Permitted Transfer of registration rights
pursuant to this Section 11(a) shall be effective upon receipt by the Company of
(i) a written notice from the Selling Shareholder stating the name and address
of any Transferee and identifying the number of Registrable Securities with
respect to which the rights under this Agreement are being transferred and the
nature of the rights so transferred and (ii) a written agreement from such
Transferee to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
     
    (b) In
connection with a Permitted Transfer of Registrable Securities owned by the
Selling Shareholder at the time of such transfer, the Selling Shareholder may
assign to any Transferee (i) a right to request pursuant to Section 3 that the
Company include any of or all such Registrable Securities in any Incidental
Registration Statement; provided, however, that no such
rights may be exercised with respect to a Demand Registration Statement filed as
a result of a demand under Section 2(a) by the Selling Shareholder; and (ii) the
right to make any number of demands under Section 2(a); provided, however, that such
number is less than or equal to the total number of demands specified in Section
2(c) as reduced by the number of demands under Section 2(a) which the Selling
Shareholder has previously made or assigned.
     
    (c) A
Transferee shall be entitled to rights granted to, and subject to the conditions
and obligations imposed upon, the Selling Shareholder by this Agreement to the
extent that the Selling Shareholder transfers rights under this Agreement to
such Transferee pursuant to Section 11(a) or 11(b); provided, however, that for
purposes of applying the proviso contained in Section 3(b), (i) the Selling
Shareholder and all of its Transferees shall be treated as a single shareholder
and (ii) the total amount of Registrable Securities which may be included in a
Registration Statement by the Selling Shareholder and all of its Transferees
shall be allocated among the Selling Shareholder and its Transferees pro rata
(based on the number of securities requested to be included).
     
    12. Amendments and
Waivers.  This Agreement may be amended with the consent of the
parties and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to
perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company shall
have obtained the written consent to such amendment, action or omission to act,
of the Selling Shareholder.
     
    13. Notices.  All
notices, requests and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder
shall be made in writing and shall be by registered or certified first-class
