              Re:  A-Power Energy
      Generation Systems, Ltd.– Lock-Up
      Agreement
            
          
      
    
     
    Dear
Sirs:
     
    This Lock-Up Agreement is being
delivered to you in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement"),
dated as of January 21, 2010 by and among A-Power Energy Generation Systems,
Ltd. (the "Company") and
the investors party thereto (the "Buyers"), with respect to the
issuance of (i) the Company's common shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the
"Common Shares") and
(ii) two series of warrants, to purchase Common Shares.  Capitalized
terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective
meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
     
    In order to induce the Buyers to enter
into the Purchase Agreement, the undersigned agrees that, commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the later to occur of (x) sixty (60) days after the Initial
Effective Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and (y) two
hundred and seventy (270) days after the date hereof (the "Lock-Up Period"), the
undersigned will not, except as contemplated by the Transaction Documents (i)
sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any
option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of or agree to
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Common Shares, or establish or increase
a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position
within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
promulgated thereunder with respect to any Common Shares owned directly by the
undersigned (including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which the
undersigned has beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or (ii) enter into any swap or other
arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of any Common Shares, owned directly by the
undersigned (including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which the
undersigned has beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, (collectively, the
"Undersigned’s
Shares").
     
    The foregoing restriction is expressly
agreed to preclude the undersigned or any affiliate of the undersigned from
engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which
reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of
the Undersigned’s Shares even if the Undersigned’s Shares would be disposed of
by someone other than the undersigned.  Such prohibited hedging or
other transactions would include, without limitation, any short sale or any
purchase, sale or grant of any right (including, without limitation, any put or
call option) with respect to any of the Undersigned’s Shares or with respect to
any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its
value from the Undersigned’s Shares, except as contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.
    
      
         

      
      
         

        
          
        
      
      
         

      
    
     
    Notwithstanding the foregoing and
subject to any limits in any other Transaction Documents, the undersigned may
transfer the Undersigned’s Shares (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts,
provided that the donee or donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the
restrictions set forth herein or (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect
benefit of the undersigned or the immediate family of the undersigned, provided
that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions
set forth herein, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve
a disposition for value.  For purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement,
“immediate family” shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption,
not more remote than first cousin.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, effective upon thirty (30) days after the Initial
Effective Date, this Lock-Up Agreement and the restrictions contained herein
shall not apply to shares acquired by the undersigned subsequent to the date
hereof upon the exercise of options granted pursuant to a Company's Approved
Share Plan (as defined in the Warrants); provided, however, that such
number of shares shall not exceed 50,000. Except as set forth in the Transaction
Documents, the undersigned now has, and, except as contemplated by clauses (i)
and (ii) above, for the duration of this Lock-Up Agreement will have, good and
marketable title to the Undersigned’s Shares, free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances, and claims whatsoever.  The undersigned also agrees and
consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company’s transfer
agent and registrar against the transfer of the Undersigned’s Shares except in
compliance with the foregoing restrictions.
     
    The undersigned understands and agrees
that this Lock-Up Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the
undersigned’s heirs, legal representatives, successors, and
assigns.
     
    This Lock-Up Agreement may be executed
in two counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but both of which
shall be considered one and the same instrument.
     
    This Lock-Up Agreement will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflicting provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York, or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of New York to be applied.  In
furtherance of the foregoing, the internal laws of the State of New York will
control the interpretation and construction of this Lock-Up Agreement, even if
under such jurisdiction's choice of law or conflict of law analysis, the
substantive law of some other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply.
     
    Each of the Company and the undersigned
hereby appoints C T Corporation System, with offices at 111 Eighth Avenue, New
York, NY 10011, as its agent for service of process in New York.
