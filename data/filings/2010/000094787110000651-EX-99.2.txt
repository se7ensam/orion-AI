    To Our
Shareholders
     
    
      We are pleased to send you our
“Report for the 68th Fiscal Year (from April 1, 2009 to March 31,
2010).”
       
      In the semiconductor industry,
chip-makers were impacted by the global downturn, and restricted capital
expenditures sharply at the beginning of the period. They gradually resumed
capital expenditures as chip prices rose and equipment utilization rates
climbed, driven by increasing demand for PCs, flat-screen TVs, and cellular
phones.
       
      Advantest benefited from these
positive market factors. Additionally, throughout the period, Advantest strove
to improve profitability by cutting costs and reducing fixed expenses through
integration of manufacturing subsidiaries, while expanding its sources of
revenue by reorganizing its sales structure and launching new products that
adapt to customer needs. These measures enabled Advantest to return to
profitability in the fourth quarter of FY2009.
       
      Although sales for the period
totaled only ¥53.2 billion (a 30.6% decrease in comparison to FY2008), due to
the drop in orders seen in late FY2008, orders and earnings improved
significantly year on year. Orders input received was ¥67.7 billion (a 35.2%
increase in comparison to FY2008). Operating loss was ¥11.6 billion (¥37.8
billion improvement in comparison to FY2008). Loss before income taxes and
equity in loss of affiliated company was ¥9.9 billion (¥42.8 billion improvement
in comparison to FY2008). Net loss was ¥11.5 billion (¥63.4 billion improvement
in comparison to FY2008).
       
      With
respect to the management environment for the upcoming fiscal year, amid the
developing consensus that the global economy has bottomed out, the semiconductor
industry appears to be set for a period of renewed expansion. Chip-makers are
proactively ramping up capital expenditures to support increased production
volumes and enhance productivity, gradually improving the management environment
surrounding Advantest. However, it remains difficult to predict whether the
momentum of such capital expenditures will be sustained. In this environment,
Advantest is unable to provide a detailed forecast at this time.
       
      In this
environment, Advantest will aim to expand its market share in the semiconductor
test systems market and make efforts to improve design quality, shorten product
development cycles, improve production efficiency, and optimize its
procurement.  Advantest plans to merge two manufacturing and service
subsidiaries in July 2010, review a series of business processes of R&D,
manufacturing, sales and maintenance service from customers’ viewpoint, and
realize more speedy and efficient management.  Advantest also intends
to cultivate new businesses such as 3D imaging analysis system, and will focus
on further reinforcing its management structure.
       
      With
respect to the dividend distribution to the shareholders, Advantest resolved at
the meeting of the Board of Directors held on May 25, 2010 to distribute a year
end dividend of 5 yen per share, with a payment date of June 2,
2010.  Since Advantest has paid an interim dividend of 5 yen, the
total dividend per share for the fiscal year will be 10 yen per share.

       
      We hope that we may rely on you for
your continued support and guidance in the future.

    Overall
     
    
      Advantest’s
FY2009 (April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010) dawned with the global economy in
recession triggered by the financial crisis of late 2008. However, a mild
upswing has now taken hold worldwide, led by economic growth in China, India,
and other emerging nations, and underpinned by the stimulus measures adopted by
many national governments.
      In the
semiconductor industry, chip-makers were also impacted by the global downturn,
and restricted capital expenditures sharply at the beginning of the period. They
gradually resumed capital expenditures as chip prices rose and equipment
utilization rates climbed, driven by increasing demand for PCs, flat-screen TVs,
and cellular phones.
      Advantest
benefited from these market factors. Additionally, throughout the period,
Advantest strove to improve profitability by cutting costs and reducing fixed
expenses through integration of manufacturing subsidiaries, while expanding its
sources of revenue by reorganizing its sales structure and launching new
products that adapt to customer needs. These measures enabled Advantest to
return to profitability in the fourth quarter of FY2009.
      As a
result of the above, although sales for the period totaled only ¥53.2 billion (a
30.6% decrease in comparison to FY2008), due to the drop in orders seen in late
FY2008, orders and earnings improved significantly year on year. Orders input
received was ¥67.7 billion (a 35.2% increase in comparison to FY2008). Operating
loss was ¥11.6 billion (¥37.8 billion improvement in comparison to FY2008). Loss
before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated company was ¥9.9 billion
(¥42.8 billion improvement in comparison to FY2008). Net loss was ¥11.5 billion
(¥63.4 billion improvement in comparison to FY2008). The percentage of net sales
to overseas customers was 77.5%, compared to 67.7% in FY2008.
       
      Business
conditions by Business Segment
       
      Semiconductor
and Component Test System Segment
       
      In the
Semiconductor and Component Test System segment, orders input received improved
significantly. Sales remained weak, due to the impact of weakened orders carried
over from the second half of FY2008.
      In the
memory sector, the Company was mired in an extremely challenging environment at
the beginning of the period, as memory makers continued to take a cautious
stance on capital expenditures. However, the upturn in PC shipments left
manufacturers struggling to keep up with demand, sparking fears of DRAM
shortages. Prices for DDR3-DRAM and other DRAM devices rose, encouraging memory
makers to resume capital expenditures, which led to a jump in orders for memory
test systems towards the end of the period.
      In
non-memory, orders for MPU test systems continued to be robust. Demand for LCD
driver IC test systems and consumer SoC test systems also expanded from the
second half of the period, as the global recovery stimulated demand for consumer
electronics including LCD TVs, cellular phones, and notebook
computers.
      As a
result of the above, orders input received was ¥42.5 billion (a 62.7% increase
in comparison to FY2008), net sales were ¥32.6 billion (a 33.8% decrease in
comparison to FY2008) and operating loss was ¥7.0 billion (¥21.9 billion
improvement in comparison to FY2008).
      
       
      Mechatronics
System Segment
       
      Demand
for Advantest’s test handlers also improved sharply during the second half of
FY2009, supported by increased activity in the DDR3-DRAM and analog IC markets.
However, the steep drop in orders in the second half of FY2008 kept sales at a
low level for the full year.

      As a
result of the above, orders input received was ¥14.8 billion (a 62.7% increase
in comparison to FY2008), net sales were ¥11.2 billion (a 21.9% decrease in
comparison to FY2008) and operating loss was ¥1.9 billion (¥10.0 billion
improvement in comparison to FY2008).
      
       
      Services,
Support and Others Segment
       
      The
Services, Support and Others Segment did not perform strongly in the period;
volumes declined in customer utilization rates of testing
equipment.
      As a
result, orders input received was ¥13.0 billion (a 17.1% decrease in comparison
to FY2008), net sales were ¥11.8 billion (a 25.1% decrease in comparison to
FY2008) and operating income was ¥2.2 billion (¥3.3 billion improvement in
comparison to FY2008).

      While
maintaining “Measurements” as our core competence in mid-and-long term,
Advantest intends to improve its corporate value by establishing a management
and financial structure that responds timely to changes in the global market,
and by aiming to increase market share by introducing fine products that will
inspire the market demands of the next generation.  To achieve these
objectives, Advantest promotes to further strengthen its product development
operations and improve production efficiency while strengthening its overseas
operations and support system in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
      As
semiconductor manufacturers relax their restrictions on capital expenditures,
Advantest is responding to signs of improvement in its business environment by
speeding up the implementation of its management strategy and seeking greater
business efficiencies. In the upcoming fiscal year, Advantest will merge with
one of its manufacturing subsidiaries and one of its service subsidiaries, and
will review its R&D, manufacturing, sales, and maintenance service processes
to further align them with customer requirements, enhancing the Company’s
ability to respond actively to market shifts.
      Through
“1000 Days,” a corporate initiative launched in July 2009, Advantest will
continue to strive to reduce lead times, provide timely new solutions optimized
for market needs, explore new markets outside the semiconductor industry, and
pursue overall cost savings, as part of a concerted strategy to improve
profitability and swiftly return to financial health.

                Reasons
      for the Company’s acquisition of the stock acquisition
    rights
              
              
                The
      Company shall automatically acquire the stock acquisition rights, for no
      consideration, if:
                 
                (a)  
      the general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve (if approval by
      the shareholders’ meeting is not legally required, then the Board of
      Directors may approve) (i) any merger agreement pursuant to which the
      Company shall dissolve, (ii) any agreement or a plan pursuant to which the
      Company shall split all or part of its business or (iii) any
      stock-for-stock exchange agreement or stock-transfer plan pursuant to
      which the Company shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of another
      company;
                (b)  the
      rights holder becomes a person who does not hold any position as a
      director, corporate auditor, executive officer, employee, advisor or
      non-regular employee of the Company or its subsidiaries before the
      expiration of the exercise period, unless the Company otherwise deems it
      appropriate to allow him/her to exercise his/her stock acquisition rights
      and notifies him/her to that effect;
                (c)  the
      rights holder dies.
              
            
              
                Restriction
      on the transfer of the stock acquisition rights
              
              
                Approval
      by the Board of Directors is required to transfer the stock acquisition
      rights, except where the Company is the transferee with respect to such
      transfer.
              
              
                Acquisition
      of the stock acquisition rights by transfer shall require an approval by
      the Board of Directors.  Provided, however, if it is the Company
      acquiring the stock acquisition rights by transfer, such transfer shall be
      deemed to be approved by the Board of
Directors.

                Reasons
      for the Company’s acquisition of the stock acquisition
    rights
              
              
                The
      Company shall automatically acquire the stock acquisition rights, for no
      consideration, if:
                (a)  
      the general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve (if approval by
      the shareholders’ meeting is not legally required, then the Board of
      Directors may approve) (i) any merger agreement pursuant to which the
      Company shall dissolve, (ii) any agreement or a plan pursuant to which the
      Company shall split all or part of its business or (iii) any
      stock-for-stock exchange agreement or stock-transfer plan pursuant to
      which the Company shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of another
      company;
                (b)  the
      rights holder becomes a person who does not hold any position as a
      director, corporate auditor, executive officer, employee, advisor or
      non-regular employee of the Company or its subsidiaries before the
      expiration of the exercise period, unless the Company otherwise deems it
      appropriate to allow him/her to exercise his/her stock acquisition rights
      and notifies him/her to that effect;
                (c)  the
      rights holder dies.
              
            
              
                Restriction
      on the transfer of the stock acquisition rights
              
              
                Acquisition
      of the stock acquisition rights by transfer shall require an approval by
      the Board of Directors.  Provided, however, if it is the Company
      acquiring the stock acquisition rights by transfer, such transfer shall be
      deemed to be approved by the Board of
Directors.

events that impair its qualification or independence, the Board of Directors
shall, upon consent of the Board of Corporate Auditors or based on a request by
the Board of Corporate Auditors, propose the dismissal or non-reappointment of
the accounting auditor as an agenda at a general meeting of

      officers while delegating necessary authorities to ensure the prompt and
      efficient performance of duties.

                Policies
      on the distribution of
surplus
              
            
      
    
     
    
      Based on
the premise that long-term and continued growth in corporate value is
fundamental to the creation of shareholder value, the Company deems the
consistent distribution of profits to be the most important management
priority.  Accordingly, the Company engages in active distribution of
profits based on business performance.
       
      With
respect to the distribution of the surplus, the Company makes payout decisions
after taking into consideration business performance, financial conditions, as
well as the need for strategic investment for mid-to-long-term business
development.  While aiming to make consistent distributions, because
of the fluctuation of the market in which it operates, the Company makes
dividend payouts following a target payout ratio of 20% or more.
       
      Retained
earnings are devoted to research and development, streamlining efforts, overseas
expansion, investments in new businesses and resources for M&A activities,
with an aim to strengthen the Company’s business position and enhance its
corporate value.
       
      In order
to maintain capital strategies responsive to changes in the operating
environment, the Company plans to decide obtaining more treasury shares by
taking into account factors such as trends in stock price, capital efficiency
and cash flow.

                Depreciation
      of property, plant, and equipment
              
            
      
      For the
Company and its domestic subsidiaries, depreciation is computed principally
using the declining-balance method, except for buildings which is depreciated
using the straight-line method.  For foreign subsidiaries,
depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.

      Goodwill
and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but
instead are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with
definite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
using the straight-line method.

                Impairment
      of long-lived assets
              
            
      
      Long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles with definite useful lives are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the carrying
amount exceeds the future recoverable amount, the Company recognizes the
difference between the fair value and the carrying amount as an impairment
loss.

      Allowances
for doubtful accounts
      The
Company recognizes allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that trade accounts
receivable are not overstated due to uncollectibility, in an amount which
represents the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credits losses
in the Company’s existing trade accounts receivable.
       
      Accrued
warranty expenses
      To
provide for future repairs during warranty periods, estimated repair expenses
over the warranty period are accrued based on the historical ratio of actual
repair expenses to corresponding sales.
       
      Accrued
pension and severance cost
      The
Company provides for employees’ retirement, severance and pension costs in
accrued amounts based on the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of
plan assets as of the end of this consolidated fiscal year.   Prior service benefit and
cost, and actuarial gain and loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) are amortized using the straight-line method over the average
remaining service period of active employees.

                Translation
      of foreign financial statements
              
            
      
      In
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries utilizing local currencies as a
functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at rates of exchange
prevailing at the end of the fiscal year, profits and expenses are translated at
average rates of exchange in effect during the year, and foreign currency
translation adjustments resulting from the above translation of items are
included as other accumulated comprehensive income (loss).  In
financial statements for foreign subsidiaries utilizing Japanese Yen as the
functional currency, the items are remeasured into Japanese Yen, and any
currency translation adjustments resulting from the above translation of items
are included as “Other profits (expenses)” realized during the period in which
the items were remeasured.

      The
Advantest group limits its fund management to short-term instruments including
deposits at financial institutions with high credit ratings.  Credit
risk of trade notes receivable and accounts receivable pertaining to customers
are minimized through credit administration standards.
      Advantest’s
investment securities mainly consist of stock.  Advantest keeps track
of fair market value of its listed stock on a quarterly basis, and reviews its
non-listed stock regularly to determine whether such stock needs to be
impaired.  In addition, Advantest annually reviews its securities,
including the stock it owns, to determine whether Advantest should continuously
hold such securities.  Advantest has no borrowings from financial
institutions, such as banks.  Furthermore, Advantest will not make any
speculative derivative transactions other than to conduct derivative exchange
rate transactions in order to cope with actual demand risks, pursuant to its
fund management guidelines with high credit rating financial
institutions.

      Merger of Subsidiaries
            
          
    
     
    
      The
Company resolved at the meeting of its Board of Directors on April 27, 2010 to
merge its consolidated subsidiaries.

      of the Merger
              
            
      
       
      The
subsidiaries to be merged, Advantest Manufacturing, Inc. and Advantest Customer
Support Corporation, are wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Company,
which engage in manufacture and/or maintenance service of the Company’s
products. The Company will merge the subsidiaries, and review their R&D,
manufacturing, sales, and maintenance service processes to further align them
with the Company’s customer requirements, speeding up the implementation of its
management strategy and seeking greater business efficiency.

                Overview
      of the Merger

                Merger
      method
              
            
      
       
      Each
subsidiary will be merged into the Company through a short-form merger
(kan-i/ryakushiki gappei) and each subsidiary will be dissolved.
       
      
        

               
              
                (ii) 
              
              
                Details
      of the allotment upon the Merger
              
            
      
       
      As the
Company owns all shares of each subsidiary, there will be no issuance of new
shares, increase of share capital or cash payment upon the merger for either
subsidiary.

                      We
      have audited the consolidated financial statements of Advantest
      Corporation (the “Company”) for its 68th fiscal year (April 1, 2009
      through March 31, 2010), including the consolidated balance sheets,
      consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of
      stockholders’ equity, and notes to consolidated financial statements, for
      the purpose of reporting under the provisions of Article 444, Paragraph 4
      of the “Company Law.”  The management of the Company was
      responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial
      statements, and our responsibility shall be limited to the expression of
      an independent opinion regarding the consolidated financial
      statements.
                       
                      We
      conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
      accepted in Japan.  These auditing standards require reasonable
      assurance that the consolidated financial statements do not contain any
      untrue statements of material fact.  The audit was conducted
      based on an audit by testing, and included a review of the consolidated
      financial statements as a whole and an evaluation of the accounting
      policies adopted by the management, the application thereof, and the
      estimates prepared by the management.  We believe that we have
      obtained a reasonable basis to form our opinion as a result of the
      audit.
                       
                      In
      our opinion, the consolidated financial statements properly present the
      financial position and the results of operations during the fiscal year,
      in all material respects, of the company group consisting of Advantest
      Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
      (Please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” “1. Notes
      to significant matters based on which the consolidated financial
      statements were prepared (1)”), pursuant to the provisions of Article 3,
      Paragraph 1 of the Supplementary Provisions of the Company Accounting
      Regulation.
                       
                      We
      have no specific interest in the Company required to be stated by the
      provisions of the Certified Public Accountant
Law.

                              We
      have audited the financial statements of Advantest Corporation (the
      “Company”) for its 68th fiscal year (April 1, 2009 through March 31,
      2010), which included the balance sheets, statements of operations,
      statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, notes to non-consolidated
      financial statements, and its supporting schedules, for the purpose of
      reporting under the provisions of Article 436, Paragraph 2, Section 1 of
      the “Company Law.”  The management of the Company was
      responsible for the preparation of these financial statements and its
      supporting schedules, and our responsibility shall be limited to the
      expression of an independent opinion regarding the financial statements
      and its supporting schedules.
                               
                              We
      conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
      accepted in Japan.  The auditing standards require reasonable
      assurance that the financial statements and its supporting schedules do
      not contain any untrue statements of material fact.  The audit
      was conducted based on an audit by testing, and included a review of the

                              In
      our opinion, the above financial statements and its supporting schedules
      properly present the financial position and the results of operations of
      the Company during the fiscal year, in all material respects, in
      conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
      Japan.

                Audit
      Report
                 
                
                  This
      Audit Report was prepared by the Board of Corporate Auditors of Advantest
      Corporation (the “Company”) after deliberation, based on audit reports
      prepared by each Corporate Auditor with respect to the methods and results
      of audit concerning the performance of each Director of his/her respective
      duties during the 68th fiscal year (April 1, 2009 through March 31,
      2010).  We hereby report as follows.
                   
                  1.     Methods
      of Audit by Corporate Auditors and the Board of Corporate Auditors, and
      its contents
                   
                  In
      addition to establishing audit policies and audit plans for the fiscal
      year, and receiving reports from each Corporate Auditor on the
      implementation status and results of the audit, the Board of Corporate
      Auditors received reports from Directors and Independent Auditors on the
      performance of their duties and requested further explanations as deemed
      necessary.
                   
                  In
      compliance with the rules of audit of Corporate Auditors established by
      the Board of Corporate Auditors, pursuant to the audit policies and audit
      plans, each Corporate Auditor communicated with Directors, Executive
      Officers as well as other employees such as members of the Audit Office in
      order to collect information, and improve the auditing system, attended
      meetings of the Board of Directors and other important meetings, received
      reports from Directors, Executive Officers and employees on the
      performance of their duties, requested further explanations as deemed
      necessary, reviewed important approval-granting documents, and inspected
      the state of business operations and assets at the head office and other
      important branch offices.
                   
                  In
      addition, we monitored and reviewed the contents of resolutions of the
      meeting of the Board of Directors with respect to the development of a
      system as defined in Article 100, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Regulations
      for Enforcement of the Company Law, as well as the status of the system
      (Internal Control System) that has been developed based on such
      resolutions.
                   
                  With
      respect to subsidiaries, we communicated with and exchanged information
      with Directors and Corporate Auditors of the subsidiaries and received
      business reports from subsidiaries as deemed necessary.
                   
                  Based
      on the above methods, we reviewed the business report for the fiscal year
      and its supporting schedules.
                   
                  In
      addition, we monitored and reviewed whether the Independent Auditors
      maintained their independent positions and conducted the audit properly,
      received reports from the Independent Auditors on the performance of their
      duties, and requested further explanations as deemed
      necessary.  Furthermore, we were informed by the Independent
      Auditor that they are establishing a “System to ensure the appropriate
      performance of duties” (Syokumu no Suikou ga Tekisetsu
      ni Okonawareru Koto o Kakuho Suru Tameno Taisei) (Matters as
      defined in each Section of Article 131 of the Company Accounting
      Regulations) pursuant to “Quality control standards of audit” (Kansa ni Kansuru Hinshitsu
      Kanri Kijyun)  (the Business Accounting Counsel, October
      28, 2005), and requested their explanations as deemed
      necessary.
                   
                  Based
      on the above methods, we reviewed the financial statements (the balance
      sheets, statements of operations, statements of changes in stockholders’
      equity, notes to non-consolidated financial statements) as well as its
      supporting schedules and the consolidated financial statements for the
      68th fiscal year (the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements
      of operations, consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, and notes
      to consolidated financial statements).
