Agrium reports improved third quarter results, cites exceptional outlook and industry fundamentals



November 3, 2010 — ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$


CALGARY, Alberta — Agrium Inc. (TSX and NYSE: AGU) announced today net earnings of $57-million
($0.37 diluted earnings per share) for the third quarter of 2010, compared with the net earnings of
$26-million in the third quarter of 2009 ($0.16 diluted earnings per share).


The 2010 third quarter results included a pre-tax expense of $85-million ($0.39 diluted earnings
per share)1 on stock-based compensation and pre-tax gains of $10-million ($0.05 diluted
earnings per share)1 on natural gas and other hedge positions. Excluding these items,
our net earnings would have been $111-million ($0.70 diluted earnings per share) for the third
quarter of 2010.


“We believe the outlook for Agrium’s products and businesses are as good as they have ever been,
supported by excellent fundamentals for the agricultural and crop input markets,” said Mike Wilson,
Agrium President and CEO. “While EBITDA from our Retail operations this quarter was almost double
last year’s level and Wholesale’s rose by more than 60 percent, we expect the improvements in the
crop input markets to become even more evident in the fourth quarter of 2010. Furthermore, we
anticipate the strength in crop input demand and prices to continue into the spring of 2011,
benefiting all three of our strategic business units”, added Mike Wilson.2


Agrium is providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010 of $1.00 to $1.30 diluted earnings per
share, excluding estimated hedging gains or losses and stock-based compensation expense in the
fourth quarter. 2

Our consolidated gross profit for the third quarter of 2010 increased by $103-million versus
the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to higher gross profit from Retail’s crop nutrients and
Wholesale’s phosphate and product purchased for resale. With a $63-million increase in expenses
for the third quarter of 2010 driven mainly by a $60-million increase in stock-based compensation
expense, our consolidated EBIT increased by $40-million for this quarter.


Consolidated gross profit for the first nine months of 2010 increased by $364-million versus the
corresponding period of 2009 primarily due to higher Retail crop nutrient gross profit and
Wholesale potash sales volumes. With a $99-million increase in expenses for the first nine months
of 2010 compared to the same period last year, our consolidated EBIT for the first nine months of
2010 increased by $264-million. Year-to-date expenses were higher largely due to a $73-million
increase in selling expenses, primarily for Retail, and a $22-million increase in stock-based
compensation expense.

2010 and 2009:

Effective tax rate was 28 percent for the third quarter of 2010, compared to 30 percent for
the same period last year due to a higher proportion of income earned in lower taxed jurisdictions
in 2010. The effective tax rate was 25 percent for the first nine months of 2010 compared to 28
percent for the corresponding period in 2009. The 3 percent decrease in the effective tax rate for
the first nine months of 2010 versus the first nine months of 2009 was primarily due to the
recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit in the first quarter of 2010.


For discussion on the performance of each business unit, see section “Business Segment
Performance”.



BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE



Retail


Retail’s 2010 third quarter net sales were $1.2-billion, the same as the third quarter of 2009.
Gross profit was $319-million in the third quarter of 2010, a 26 percent increase from the
$254-million earned last year, while EBIT increased to $75-million this quarter, more than double
the $31-million achieved in the third quarter of 2009. This improvement was due to a return to more
comparable five-year average crop nutrient margins and sales volumes, versus the challenges
experienced in 2009.



3




 





Crop nutrient net sales were $411-million this quarter compared to $345-million in the same quarter
last year. The increase was due to the 15 percent increase in crop nutrient sales volumes and
higher nutrient prices. Gross profit for crop nutrients was $86-million this quarter compared to
the third quarter results of $31-million achieved in 2009. Crop nutrient margins returned to
historical levels, averaging 21 percent in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the unusually
compressed margins of 9 percent experienced in the third quarter of 2009. We anticipate strong
crop nutrient margins and gross profit to continue in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the recent
rise in most crop and nutrient prices and a wider window for fall application.1 Sales
volumes and margins in our South American operations were also higher this quarter than the same
period last year due to higher wheat prices, fertilizer price appreciation, and improved moisture
conditions.


Crop protection net sales were $712-million in the third quarter of 2010, a 7 percent decrease from
the $768-million in sales for the same period last year. This decrease was due to lower pest
pressure this summer, supplier programs which encouraged sales in the first quarter of 2010, and
glyphosate price devaluation. Gross profit this quarter was $172-million, slightly higher than the
same period last year. Crop protection product margins as a percentage of net sales were 24
percent for the third quarter of 2010, up 2 percent from the same period last year, largely due to
the lower cost of product per unit.


Net sales for seed increased by 19 percent to $44-million this quarter, from $37-million in the
third quarter of 2009. Gross profit was $24-million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to
$8-million for the same period last year due to fewer private label seed returns and higher
supplier rebate programs this quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 55 percent
this quarter, versus 22 percent for the same period in 2009. On a year-to-date basis, 2010 margins
are slightly below 2009.


Application services and other net sales were $77-million this quarter, consistent with the third
quarter of 2009. Gross profit was $37-million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to
$46-million for the same period last year. The decline in gross profit was due to lower pest
pressure this season.


Retail selling expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were $220-million, a 10 percent increase over
last year’s level, primarily due to increased hiring and head count associated with current year
acquisitions. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 18 percent in the third quarter
of 2010 compared with 16 percent for the same period last year.


On June 30, 2010, Retail acquired 24 farm centres and a world-class formulation facility in
Casilda, Argentina, from DuPont Crop Protection. The Casilda formulation facility provides a
versatile range of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides for the Argentinean market, as well as
toll manufacturing for third party companies. This brings the total number of Agrium’s retail farm
centers in South America under the Agroservicios Pampeanos (ASP) name to 51 outlets and a
formulation facility.


In addition to this acquisition, and the recently announced AWB retail business in Australia,
Agrium continues to grow our North American retail business. We recently completed an asset
purchase agreement with Miles Farm Supply to acquire its 19 branches primarily located in Kentucky
and the deal is expected to close very shortly. We also acquired an additional 45 independent
retail branches across Canada and the U.S. so far in 2010. The combined annualized retail net
sales in 2010 from these 88 new retail branches across North and South America is approximately
$440-million.

Wholesale


Wholesale reported strong net sales of $799-million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to
$658-million for the third quarter of 2009. Gross profit was $179-million in the third quarter of
2010, a $46-million increase over same period last year. EBIT of $135-million in the third quarter
of 2010 was the second highest on record for a third quarter and significantly higher than the
$83-million earned in the third quarter of 2009. The strong results across all products were due
to a combination of higher nutrient sales prices and volumes, the majority of the improvement over
last year was from improved results in our phosphate and Purchase for Resale businesses. Agrium
reported equity earnings of $6-million for its interest in the MOPCO Egyptian nitrogen facility. In
addition the project to triple the production capacity is on schedule for completion by mid-2012.


Nitrogen gross profit was $80-million this quarter, the same as the third quarter of 2009, as
higher prices and volumes were offset by higher costs. Nitrogen prices were higher than last year
across all products for both benchmark and Agrium’s realized prices. Domestic ammonia and urea
volumes were up compared to the third quarter of 2009, while our international sales volumes were
significantly lower this quarter due to a planned turnaround at our South American facility.
Nitrogen cost of product sold was $221 per tonne this quarter compared with $196 per tonne in the
third quarter of 2009. The higher cost of product sold was due to higher North American natural
gas prices and higher costs associated with the extended planned turnaround at our South American
facility. Agrium’s average nitrogen margin was $84 per tonne this quarter, compared with $87 per
tonne in the third quarter of last year, while margins for our domestic urea sales remained over
$100 per tonne this quarter.


The U.S. benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the third quarter of 2010 was $4.41/MMBtu, versus
$3.41/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $4.07/MMBtu in the second quarter of 2010. The AECO
(Alberta) basis differential was a $0.86/MMBtu discount to NYMEX for the third quarter of 2010.
Agrium’s overall gas cost for the current quarter was $4.01/MMBtu ($3.73/MMBtu excluding $7-million
in realized hedging losses). The overall gas cost was the same in the third quarter of 2009
($4.01/MMBtu), but was significantly lower ($2.88/MMBtu) excluding realized hedging losses of
$29-million. Hedging gains and losses on gas derivatives are reported below gross profit and
therefore not included in cost of goods sold.


Potash gross profit was $59-million in the third quarter of 2010 versus $56-million in the third
quarter of 2009. Sales volumes were up 42 percent or 115,000 tonnes over the same period last
year. The average sales price was $327 per tonne this quarter, down from $399 per tonne for the
same period last year. Both international and
domestic demand showed significant strength this quarter. Cost of product sold on a per tonne
basis was $175 per tonne or $19 per tonne lower than for the same quarter last year, due to fixed
costs and turnaround spend being allocated over higher sales tonnes. Gross margin was $152 per
tonne compared with $205 per tonne in the third quarter of last year.


Phosphate gross profit was $24-million, compared to a loss of $1-million in the same quarter last
year. The significant improvement was due to higher realized sales prices of $517 per tonne this
quarter, compared to $368 per tonne for the same quarter last year, as strong phosphate demand
resulted in very tight industry inventory levels. Phosphate cost of product sold was $438 per
tonne, or $67 per tonne higher than the third quarter of 2009, due to a combination of higher
sulphur, rock costs, and the impact of the higher Canadian dollar at our Canadian phosphate
operation. Gross margin was $79 per tonne, an $82 per tonne increase over the third quarter of 2009
and a $38 per tonne improvement over the second quarter of 2010.

Gross profit for the Purchase for Resale business in the third quarter of 2010 was $9-million, a
significant increase over the same period last year. The improvement was due to an increase in
both sales prices and volumes in our European and North American markets.


Wholesale expenses were $6-million lower in the third quarter of 2010 than the same period last
year, due primarily to a $17-million decrease in potash profit and capital taxes compared with the
same period in 2009 and a $6-million increase in equity earnings from our 26 percent Egyptian
investment, partly offset by a $12-million increase in stock based compensation. The third quarter
of 2010 included realized losses on natural gas and power derivatives of $7-million and
mark-to-market gains of $4-million. The same quarter in 2009 included realized losses of
$29-million and mark-to-market gains of $31-million on the same type of derivatives.



Advanced Technologies


Advanced Technologies’ third quarter 2010 net sales were $92-million compared to $60-million in the
third quarter of 2009. Gross profit was $15-million for the quarter, compared with $11-million for
the same period last year. The increase in net sales and gross profit for the quarter was due to
higher Environmentally Smart Nitrogen (“ESN”) sales volumes and the transfer of Agrium’s Retail
turf and ornamental business in late 2009, which contributed $6-million in gross profit in the
current quarter.


ESN sales volumes were up approximately 35,000 tonnes or 146 percent in the third quarter of 2010
when compared to the same period last year, as a result of sales execution and additional
production volumes from our new facility at New Madrid, Missouri. Production at the New Madrid
facility is meeting expectations and planned targets for 2010.


EBITDA for the current quarter was $1-million, a decrease of $3-million versus the comparable
period in 2009. The reduction in EBITDA was due to the $7-million increase in selling costs
primarily related to the inclusion of the turf and ornamental business transferred from Retail in
late 2009.



Other


EBIT for our Other non-operating business unit for the third quarter of 2010 was a loss of
$103-million, an increase in loss of $52-million compared to a loss of $51-million for the third
quarter of 2009. The increase in loss was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation
expense from a larger increase in share price during the third quarter of 2010 versus the same
period last year, and a deferral of gross profit on Wholesale products sold to Retail that have yet
to be sold to external customers.


EBIT for Other for the first nine months of 2010 was a loss of $119-million, an increase in loss of
$85-million compared to a loss of $34-million for the same period of 2009. The increase in loss
reflected the deferral of gross profit on Wholesale products sold to Retail that have yet to be
sold to external customers and the expensing of costs related to the proposed acquisition of CF
Industries Holdings Inc. (“CF”) incurred in 2009. The decrease in EBIT was partially offset by
gains realized from the sale of 1.2 million CF shares (see discussion under “Business
Acquisitions”).

The sources and uses of cash for the three months ended September 30, 2010 are summarized
below:



Cash provided by operating activities – Drivers behind the $139-million decrease in source of cash






     
     
     
     
     





    Source of cash

     
    ▪

     
    $31-million resulting from increase in net
earnings adjusted for changes in non-cash items,
primarily associated with a $46-million increase
from future income taxes and $60-million increase
from stock-based compensation.


     
     
     
     
     


    Use of cash

     
    ▪

     
    $300-million increase in non-cash working
capital. The increase in non-cash working capital
was primarily driven by an increase in prepaid
expenses and deposits and a lower decrease in
inventories in the third quarter of 2010 compared
to the third quarter of 2009. These were partially
offset by a lower decrease in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities in the third quarter of 2010
versus the third quarter of 2009.


     
     
     
     
     


    Cash provided by financing activities – Drivers behind the $269-million increase in source of cash


     
     
     
     
     


    Source of cash

     
    ▪

     
    Increase in bank indebtedness in Q3’10 due
to higher working capital needs for product
purchases versus pay-down of bank indebtedness in
Q3’10.

The sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 are summarized
below:






     
     
     
     
     





    Cash used in operating activities – Drivers behind the $482-million decrease in source of cash


     
     
     
     
     



    Source of cash

     
    ▪

     
    $220-million resulting from increase in net earnings adjusted for changes in non-cash
items, primarily associated with a $217-million increase from future income taxes.


     
     
     
     
     


    Use of cash

     
    ▪

     
    $979-million increase in non-cash working capital. The increase in non-cash working
capital was primarily driven by a lower decrease in inventories and a higher decrease in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the first nine
months of 2009.


     
     
     
     
     


    Cash used in investing activities – Drivers behind the $169-million decrease in use of cash


     
     
     
     
     


    Source of cash

     
    ▪

     
    Proceeds of $117-million received on the sale of our shares in CF in Q1’10 that were
purchased for $65-million in Q1’09;


     
     
     
     
     


     

     
    ▪

     
    Proceeds of $25-million received in Q1’10 on the sale of other marketable securities; and


     
     
     
     
     


     

     
    ▪

     
    Other favourable adjustments, including costs related to the proposed CF acquisition
incurred in 2009.


     
     
     
     
     


    Use of cash

     
    ▪

     
    $124-million increase in capital expenditures.


     
     
     
     
     


    Cash provided by financing activities – Drivers behind the $409-million increase in source of cash


     
     
     
     
     


    Source of cash

     
    ▪

     
    Pay-down of our bank indebtedness due to lower working capital needs in the first nine
months of 2009 and removal of EAgrium bank indebtedness in Q1’09 as result of the deconsolidation
of EAgrium.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, quarter-to-quarter
results are not directly comparable. Sales are concentrated in the spring and fall planting
seasons, while produced inventories are accumulated ahead of the application season. Cash
collections generally occur after the planting seasons in North and South America.



BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS


On August 15, 2010, Agrium announced that it had made a proposal to acquire AWB and on August 19,
2010, Agrium announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with AWB to acquire all of the
outstanding shares and performance rights of AWB for AUD$1.50 per share in cash for
AUD$1.238-billion pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under Australian law (the “Scheme”). On
August 24, 2010, Agrium announced that the AWB Board of Directors had recommended Agrium’s proposed
acquisition to AWB shareholders. On October 3, 2010, the Australian Foreign Investment Review
Board notified Agrium that there are no objections to the proposed acquisition in terms of the
Australian Government’s foreign investment policy. The implementation of the Scheme remains subject
to the approval of the shareholders of AWB and of the Supreme Court of Victoria. The shareholders
of AWB will vote on the Scheme at an AWB shareholders’ meeting to be held on November 16, 2010 in
Melbourne, Australia and, assuming the shareholders of AWB approve the Scheme, the approval of the
Supreme Court of Victoria will be sought on November 18, 2010. We have also sought the approval of
the New Zealand Overseas Investment Authority and anticipate a response to our application by
mid-November. Assuming these conditions are met and the required approvals are received, Agrium
expects the Scheme to be implemented around December 6, 2010. Agrium will primarily use cash on
hand to fund the acquisition, and if required will access unused lines of credit.


On March 11, 2010, Agrium announced that it would no longer pursue an acquisition of CF and allowed
its offer for CF to expire on March 22, 2010. Acquisition costs of $45-million, previously recorded
in prepaid expenses and deposits, were expensed on expiry of the offer. In March 2010, Agrium sold
its investment in CF, consisting of 1.2 million common shares, and recorded a pre-tax gain in other
expenses of $52-million. Unrealized gains on the shares had previously been recorded in other
comprehensive income. Following
termination of the CF offer, the conditional sale of 50 percent of the Carseland nitrogen facility
to Terra Industries Inc. was also terminated.

First-time adoption of IFRS


Agrium’s adoption of IFRS will require the application of IFRS 1 – First Time Adoption of
International Financial Reporting Standards. This standard provides guidance for Agrium’s initial
adoption which requires, in general, that Agrium apply all IFRS effective at the end of its first
IFRS reporting period retrospectively. However, IFRS 1 does require certain mandatory exceptions
and permits certain optional exemptions from this general requirement. Agrium continues to assess
the implications of IFRS 1 on its opening balance sheet.






     
     
     


    Area of IFRS
     
    Summary of Action





    Business Combinations
Agrium may elect, on transition to
IFRS, to either restate all past
business combinations in accordance
with IFRS 3 Business Combinations or to
apply an elective exemption from
applying IFRS 3 to past business
combinations.

     
    Policy selection: expect to
elect, on transition to IFRS, to
apply the exemption such that
transactions entered into prior
to the transition date will not
be restated.


     
     
     


    Share-Based Payments
Agrium may elect not to apply IFRS 2,
Share-Based Payments, to equity
instruments granted on or before
November 7, 2002 or which vested before
Agrium’s date of transition to IFRS.
Agrium may also elect not to apply IFRS
2 to liabilities arising from
share-based payment transactions which
settled before the date of transition
to IFRS.

     
    

Policy selection: expect to
elect not to apply IFRS 2 to
equity instruments granted on or
before November 7, 2002 or which
vested before the Agrium’s date
of transition to IFRS. Agrium
may also elect not to apply IFRS
2 to liabilities arising from
share-based payment transactions
which settled before the date of
transition to IFRS.


     
     
     


    Employee Benefits
IFRS permits the recognition of
actuarial gains and losses immediately
in equity, immediately to earnings, or
on a deferred basis to earnings.
Canadian GAAP does not permit immediate
recognition in equity. Further, under
IFRS, vested past service costs are
required to be expensed immediately
while unvested costs are to be
amortized on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period. Under Canadian
GAAP, past service costs are amortized
over the expected average remaining
service life of active employees,
unless employees in that plan are
inactive. Costs are then amortized over
the average life expectancy of the
former employees. This change is
expected to accelerate the recognition
of past service costs. 


Agrium may elect to recognize all
cumulative actuarial gains and losses
through opening retained earnings at
the date of transition to IFRS.
Actuarial gains and losses would have
to be recalculated under IFRS from the
inception of each of our defined
benefit plans if the exemption is not
taken. Agrium’s choice must be
consistently applied to all defined
benefit plans.

     
    
Policy selection: expect to
recognize all cumulative
actuarial gains and losses at
the date of transition as an
adjustment to retained earnings.


     
     
     


    Foreign Exchange
On transition, cumulative translation
gains or losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income can be
reclassified to retained earnings at
Agrium’s election. If not elected, all
cumulative translation differences must
be recalculated under IFRS from
inception.

     
    
Policy selection: expect to
elect the exemption and
reclassify the balance of
cumulative foreign exchange
translation gains or losses will
be adjusted from other
comprehensive income to retained
earnings, with no resulting
change to shareholders’ equity.

    Area of IFRS
     
    Summary of Action





    Decommissioning Liabilities
In accounting for changes in
obligations to dismantle, remove and
restore items of property, plant and
equipment, the guidance in IFRS
requires changes in such obligations to
be added to or deducted from the cost
of the asset to which it relates. The
adjusted depreciable amount of the
asset is then depreciated prospectively
over its remaining useful life. Rather
than recalculating the effect of all
such changes throughout the life of the
obligation, Agrium may elect to measure
the liability and the related
depreciation effects at the date of
transition to IFRS.

     
    Policy selection: expect to
elect to take the exemption from
full retrospective application
as permitted by IFRIC 1
Changes in Existing
Decommissioning Restoration and
Similar Liabilities.





Following are the standards that may have significant impact on Agrium’s consolidated
financial statements. This is not an exhaustive listing of changes on transition to IFRS. Detailed
analysis and quantification of these changes is continuing. Agrium does not expect a significant
impact to its business activities nor to its operating cash flows from the transition to IFRS.






     
     
     


    Significant Differences Between IFRS and Canadian GAAP
     
    Estimated Impact






    Employee Benefits
IFRS permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized
directly in other comprehensive income rather than
through profit or loss while Canadian GAAP does not allow
immediate recognition in equity.

     
    Transition date impact: none

Future impact: greater
variability in shareholders’
equity within other
comprehensive income


     
     
     


    Share-based payments


     
    
Transition date impact: reduction in shareholders’
equity and an increase in
liabilities 
Future impact: a continued
measurement difference
between the intrinsic value
and the fair value of share
based awards


    IFRS requires cash-settled, share-based awards to be
measured at fair value, while Canadian GAAP allows these
awards to be measured at intrinsic value. In addition,
Agrium currently uses straight line depreciation to
recognize graded vesting stock based instruments, while
IFRS requires that each installment be accounted for as a
separate arrangement.

     


     
     
     


    Income Taxes

     
    
Transition date impact: reclassifying all future
income taxes to non-current
is expected to result in a
decrease in current assets
and a decrease in non-current
income tax liabilities 
Future impact: remains a
classification difference 

Transition date impact: increase in deferred tax
liabilities and a
corresponding decrease in
retained earnings 
Future impact: continued
recognition of the deferred
tax impact with respect to
the translation of foreign
denominated non-monetary
assets or liabilities


    Classification of future income tax under IFRS is
non-current whereas Canadian GAAP splits future income
taxes between current and non-current components. 

IFRS requires recognition of the deferred tax impact for
temporary differences arising on translation of certain
foreign denominated non-monetary assets or liabilities.
Canadian GAAP does not allow similar treatment.

    Significant Differences Between IFRS and Canadian GAAP
     
    Estimated Impact





    Provisions

     
    Transition date impact: decrease in environmental
liabilities and a
corresponding increase to
retained earnings 
Future impact: each period
there will be a charge to
earnings for accretion of the
discount 
Transition date impact: increase to asset retirement
obligations and a
corresponding decrease to
retained earnings
Future impact: decrease in
charge to earnings each
period for accretion of the
discount


    
IFRS requires discounting of provisions where the effect
of the discounting is material. Provisions are not
discounted under Canadian GAAP unless specifically
required or when a provision is required to be measured
at fair value. 
The specific provisions for asset retirement obligations
under IFRS are measured based on management’s best
estimate. The discount rate used in calculating the
present value of the cash flow estimates is to be based on risks specific to the liability unless these risks
have been incorporated into the cash flow estimates.
Canadian GAAP measures asset retirement obligations at
fair value incorporating market assumptions. The discount
rate used is a credit-adjusted risk-free rate.

     


     

     


     
     
     


    Impairment of Assets

     
    

Transition date impact: increased potential for
impairment losses and
reversal of previously
recorded losses 
Future impact: increased
potential for impairment
losses and reversal of
previously recorded losses


    
Under IFRS, the impairment of assets, excluding financial
assets, is tested and measured by comparing the carrying
value of an asset or cash generating unit to its
recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured as the
higher of fair value less cost to sell or value-in-use
(discounted future cash flows). IFRS permits impairment
reversals for assets (excluding goodwill). The IFRS
approach has the potential to increase income statement
volatility due to the potential for increased write-downs
and reversals of write-downs.

     


     
     
     


    Business Combinations

     
    

Transition date impact: decrease in shareholders’
equity 
Future impact: potential
increase in charges to
earnings in the amount of
acquisition-related costs for
any business combination


    IFRS does not include acquisition-related costs within
consideration transferred in a business combination
whereas the cost of acquisition does include direct,
incremental acquisition-related costs under Canadian
GAAP.

     
    


     
     
     


    Non-Controlling Interest

     
    

Transition date impact: increase in shareholders’
equity
Future impact: non-controlling interest will
continue to be presented
within shareholders’ equity


    IFRS requires non-controlling interest to be presented as
a component of shareholders’ equity separate from the
parent’s equity while Canadian GAAP presents non-controlling interest as a separate component between
liabilities and equity.

     


     
     






Financial Impact


The following unaudited table shows the impacts of the differences between IFRS and Canadian GAAP
identified to date with a transition date of January 1, 2010. Mandatory and optional exemptions
and policy choices we have made to date are applied. These amounts are subject to change as Agrium
continues to consider both its transitional exemption options and the impacts on transition to
IFRS.

NON-GAAP MEASURES


In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary measures of
earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net earnings before interest expense
and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation,
amortization and asset impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of
performance because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of historical performance
for the different business segments. Similarly, financing and related interest charges cannot be
allocated to all business units on a basis that is meaningful for comparison with other companies.


EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of calculation may not be
comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should not be used as an alternative to cash
provided by (used in) operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.


The following table is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net earnings as calculated in
accordance with GAAP:

BUSINESS RISKS


The information presented on enterprise risk management and business risks on pages 81 – 88 in our
2009 Annual Report has not changed materially since December 31, 2009.



CONTROLS & PROCEDURES


There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended September 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES


Global agricultural supply and demand fundamentals have strengthened significantly over the
past few months. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects that global grain
ending stocks will decline by 12 percent in the 2010/11 crop year. In its October forecast, the
USDA significantly reduced its projection of U.S. corn production resulting in U.S. corn stocks
expected to be at their lowest level since 1996/97.


U.S. corn growers are expected to respond to the tight supply and demand balance by planting in
excess of 90 million acres of corn in 2011. The earlier than normal harvest in the U.S. and
improved fall weather in Western Canada is expected to lead to strong crop nutrient applications in
the fourth quarter. Increased seeded area, in particular for corn and wheat, and anticipated
strong cash margins for most crops are all expected to be highly supportive of robust demand for
crop nutrients, seed and crop protection product demand in the fall of 2010 and spring of 2011.
U.S. fall demand for crop nutrients has been extremely strong.


Solid demand for nitrogen in Europe and North America has been supportive to the nitrogen market.
As of September 30, 2010, The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) reported that North American urea
inventories were 20 percent lower than they were a year ago and 16 percent below the five-year
average. Indian urea import demand has been supported by plentiful monsoon rains. Chinese
exporters have gained a large share of the
recent Indian import demand and are expected to export a large volume of urea during the reduced
export tax period at the end of 2010. It has been reported that the domestic Chinese urea market
has recently tightened and that logistics are backing up in Chinese ports, which has also been
supportive to the market.

The global supply and demand balance for phosphate remains historically tight. The TFI reported
U.S. DAP/MAP inventories in September to be almost 30 percent below the five-year average. Strong
Indian demand has also been supportive to the market and analysts expect this will continue into
2011. Similar to urea, China is acting as a swing exporter of phosphates and depending on
shipments in the fourth quarter, China could export record DAP/MAP volumes in 2010 in order to meet
strong global demand. Delays at the Ma’aden phosphate project in Saudi Arabia means that there is
limited new phosphate supply available to the market for at least the first half of 2011.


Strong demand for potash, both within North America and globally, has also drawn down inventories
for this product over the past couple of months. The September TFI report showed North American
potash inventories were down 55 percent from the same period last year and 17 percent below the
five-year average. The earlier than normal harvest in the U.S. will be positive for potash
applications, adding to the tightness in the North American distribution pipeline. In addition,
demand in regions such as South East Asia and Brazil has strengthened recently, further tightening
global availability. Potash volumes are expected to increase significantly in the 2010/11
fertilizer year as growers respond to a combination of favorable economics and below-normal
application rates in the past two fertilizer years.

information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation or constitute
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable U.S. securities legislation
(together, “forward-looking statements”). All statements in this press release, other than those
relating to historical information or current conditions, are forward-looking statements,
including, but not limited to, estimates, forecasts and statements as to management’s expectations
with respect to, among other things, business and financial prospects, financial multiples and
accretion estimates, future trends, plans, strategies and objective, including with respect to
future operations following the proposed acquisition of AWB. Such forward-looking statements
involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties as well as various assumptions and business
sensitivities, including those referred to in the MD&A section of the Corporation’s most recent
Annual Report to Shareholders as well as those risk factors described in the Corporation’s most
recent Annual Information Form, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of

expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
any recent or proposed business acquisitions not being integrated successfully or such integration
may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected, the expected combination benefits
and synergies and costs savings from the Agrium/AWB transaction may not be fully realized or not
realized within the expected time frame, disruption from the proposed transaction making it more
difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. Other factors for

AGRIUM INC.
Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010
(Millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)
(Unaudited)




1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



The Company’s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in Canada and are consistent with those outlined in the annual audited financial
statements except where stated below. These interim consolidated financial statements do not
include all disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements and should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2009. In management’s opinion, the interim consolidated financial statements include
all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information. The Company has evaluated events
subsequent to the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.



The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Sales are concentrated in the spring and
fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are accumulated ahead of the application season.
Cash collections generally occur after the planting seasons in North and South America.



Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.




2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS



AWB Limited



On August 14, 2010, the Company submitted a fully financed proposal to acquire 100 percent of the
outstanding shares of AWB Limited (“AWB”) at a price of AUD $1.50 per share, resulting in a
purchase price of AUD $1.2-billion. The Scheme of Arrangement (“Scheme”) is subject to conditions
precedent typically included in transactions of this type, including unanimous support of the AWB
Board. The Company and AWB have entered into a definitive agreement that the AWB Board has
recommended to the AWB shareholders. On October 3, 2010, the Australian Foreign Investment Review
Board notified the Company that there are no objections to the proposed acquisition in terms of the
Australian Government’s foreign investment policy. The implementation of the Scheme remains subject
to the approval of the shareholders of AWB and of the Supreme Court of Victoria.



CF Industries Holdings, Inc.



On March 11, 2010, the Company announced that it would no longer pursue an acquisition of CF
Industries Holdings, Inc. (“CF”) and allowed its offer for CF to expire on March 22, 2010.
Acquisition costs of $45-million, previously recorded in prepaid expenses and deposits, were
expensed on expiry of the offer. In March 2010, the Company sold its investment in CF, consisting
of 1.2 million common shares, and recorded a pre-tax gain in other expenses of $52-million.
Unrealized gains on the shares had previously been recorded in other comprehensive income.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



Risk management



In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash
flows are exposed to various risks. On an annual basis, the Board approves a strategic plan that
takes into account the opportunities and major risks of the Company’s business and mitigation
factors to reduce these risks. The Board also reviews risk management policies and procedures on an
annual basis and sets upper limits on the transactional exposure to be managed and the time periods
over which exposures may be managed. The Company manages risk in accordance with its Exposure
Management Policy. The objective of the policy is to reduce volatility in cash flow.



Sensitivity analysis to risk is provided where the effect on net earnings or shareholders’ equity
could be material. Sensitivity analysis is performed by relating the reasonably possible changes in
the risk variable at September 30, 2010 to financial instruments outstanding on that date while
assuming all other variables remain constant.



Market risk



(a) Currency risk



U.S. dollar denominated transactions in our Canadian operations generate foreign exchange gains and
losses on outstanding balances which are recognized in net earnings. The net U.S. dollar
denominated balance in Canadian operations is $497-million. A $10-million impact on net earnings
requires a strengthening or weakening of $0.03 in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar.

    (48
    )






A foreign currency translation adjustment is recognized in other comprehensive income upon
translation of our Canadian and European operations to U.S. dollars. A $10-million increase in
comprehensive income requires a strengthening of $0.03 of the Canadian dollar or a weakening of
€0.19 of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. A $10-million decrease in comprehensive income
requires a weakening of $0.04 of the Canadian dollar or a strengthening of €0.13 of the Euro
against the U.S. dollar.



(b) Commodity price risk



For natural gas derivative financial instruments outstanding at September 30, 2010, a $10-million
increase in net earnings requires an increase of $1.44 per MMBtu.

(Unaudited)



(c) Interest rate risk



The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a term of three
months or less that earn interest at market rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk on
these investments by maximizing the interest income earned on excess funds while maintaining the
liquidity necessary to conduct operations on a day-to-day basis. Fluctuations in market rates of
interest on cash and cash equivalents do not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of
operations due to the short term to maturity of the investments.

The Company may be exposed to certain losses in the event that counterparties to short-term
investments and derivative financial instruments are unable to meet their contractual obligations.
The Company manages this counterparty credit risk with policies requiring that counterparties to
short-term investments and derivative financial instruments have an investment grade or higher
credit rating and policies that limit the investing of excess funds to liquid instruments with a
maximum term of one year and limit the maximum exposure to any one counterparty. The Company also
enters into master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to counterparty credit risk. At
September 30, 2010, all counterparties to derivative financial instruments have maintained an
investment grade or higher credit rating and there is no indication that any counterparty will be
unable to meet their obligations under derivative contracts.

11. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT



The Company’s primary objectives when managing capital are to provide for: (a) an appropriate
rate of return to shareholders in relation to the risks underlying the Company’s assets; and, (b) a
prudent capital structure for raising capital at a reasonable cost for the funding of ongoing
operations, capital expenditures, and new growth initiatives.



The ratios outlined in the table below are monitored by the Company in managing its capital.

    (a)
     
    Net debt includes bank indebtedness and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents. Equity consists of shareholders’ equity.


 


    (b)
     
    Interest coverage is the last twelve months net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset impairment divided by interest, which includes interest on long-term debt plus other interest.


 


    (c)
     
    The measures of debt and net earnings described above are non-GAAP financial measure which do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other
issuers.


 


    (d)
     
    The Company’s strategy for managing capital is unchanged from December 31, 2009.







The Company’s revolving credit facilities require that the Company maintain specific interest
coverage and debt to capital ratios as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in the debt
agreements. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2010.
