Revision of earnings forecast for this period: Yes
      Advantest
did not report the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011
in late April of this year due to difficulty in forecasting trends in the demand
for semiconductors and investment plans for semiconductor related capital
expenditures. At this time, we are able to disclose the earnings forecast for
the six months ending September 30, 2010, taking into account trends in orders
input received and other factors in the first quarter. Such earnings forecast is
disclosed above. As to the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March
31, 2011, Advantest intends to promptly disclose the relevant earnings forecast
when such disclosure becomes possible.

      In the
first quarter of FY2010, despite the European financial crisis and other factors
that threatened to hamper global economic growth, the overall recovery trend
steadily strengthened, primarily led by expansion in China and the other
emerging countries economies.
      Supported
by increasing demand for consumer electronics, principally flat-screen
televisions, PCs and smartphones, the semiconductor market demand continued its
recovery, which encouraged manufacturers to increase their capital investment
activities.
      Amid
these positive shifts in the business environment, Advantest increased earnings
by expanding sales of key product lines, gaining new customers, and shipping
products to meet customers’ tight delivery schedules.
      As a
result of the above, net sales were (Y) 23.5 billion (a 209.2% increase in
comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), orders
input received was (Y) 30.8 billion (a 164.9% increase in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), operating income was (Y) 1.8
billion ((Y) 6.3 billion improvement in comparison to the corresponding period
of the previous fiscal year), income before income taxes and equity in loss of
affiliated company was (Y) 1.6 billion ((Y) 5.4 billion improvement in
comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), net income
was (Y) 0.8 billion ((Y) 4.6 billion improvement in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). The percentage of net sales
to overseas customers was 78.7%, compared to 74.0% in the corresponding period
of the previous fiscal year.

      In the
Semiconductor and Component Test System Segment, revenues grew dramatically as a
result of increased capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers,
reflecting the recovery of the semiconductor market.
      In the
memory semiconductor test system, Advantest saw stronger demand for its
products, principally in test systems for high-performance DDR3-DRAM, driven by
active capital investment from manufacturers of DRAM devices for the PC and
cellular phone markets.
      In the
non-memory semiconductor test system, test systems for the microprocessors used
in PCs and portable and wireless devices saw strong demand, as did test systems
for consumer ICs and LCD driver ICs, used in flat-screen televisions and other
display applications.
      As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 21.6 billion (a 190.7%
increase in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year),
net sales were (Y) 15.8 billion (a 289.3% increase in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year) and operating income was (Y)
2.1 billion ((Y) 4.9 billion improvement in comparison to the corresponding
period of the previous fiscal year).

Analysis of Financial Condition
      Total
assets at June 30, 2010 amounted to (Y) 187.3 billion, a decrease of (Y) 1.3
billion compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to decrease of (Y) 11.6
billion in cash and cash equivalents, increase of (Y) 5.3 billion and (Y) 3.8
billion in short-term investments and trade receivables, respectively. The
amount of total liabilities was (Y) 39.9 billion, an increase of (Y) 1.4 billion
compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to increase in trade accounts payable.
Stockholders’ equity was (Y) 147.5 billion. Equity to assets ratio was 78.7%, a
decrease of 0.9 percentage point from March 31, 2010.
      
      (Cash
Flow Condition)
      Cash and
cash equivalents held at June 30, 2010 were (Y) 84.9 billion, a decrease of (Y)
11.6 billion from March 31, 2010. Significant cash flows during the first
quarter of this fiscal year and their causes are described below.
      Net cash
used in operating activities was (Y) 2.9 billion (Net cash outflow (Y) 11.2
billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year) mainly due to
the combination of net income of (Y) 0.8 billion, increase in trade receivables
in the amount of (Y) 4.5 billion, inventories in the amount of (Y) 3.1 billion
and trade accounts payable in the amount of (Y) 3.2 billion.
      Net cash
used in investing activities was (Y) 5.9 billion (Net cash inflow (Y) 9.0
billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount
was primarily attributable to increase in short-term investments in the amount
of (Y) 5.4 billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount
of (Y) 0.4 billion.
      Net cash
used in financing activities was (Y) 0.9 billion (Net cash outflow (Y) 0.9
billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount
was primarily attributable to (Y) 0.9 billion dividends paid.

Prospects for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
      Amid
expanding global demand for semiconductors used in portable and wireless devices
and other consumer electronics, automobiles, and other products, semiconductor
manufacturers are proactively implementing capital investment directed towards
capacity expansion, process shrinks, and productivity enhancement, leading
Advantest to forecast that the overall recovery trend in the company’s business
environment will continue.
      In this
operating environment, Advantest will focus on developing new products optimized
for a broad array of cost-sensitive test needs. In July 2010, the company merged
with two wholly owned subsidiaries providing manufacturing and maintenance
services, implementing a reorganization aimed at improving efficiency. Advantest
will continue to strive to enhance revenues and earnings by reinforcing its
ability to respond to economic trends and market fluctuations.
      For the
six months ending September 30, 2010, Advantest forecasts net sales of (Y) 53.0
billion, operating income of (Y) 5.0 billion, income before income taxes and
equity in earnings of affiliated company of
(Y) 4.9
billion and net income of (Y) 3.1 billion.
