    Mr.
Jinxiang Lu, A-Power's Chairman and CEO commented, "We are very pleased with our
fourth quarter results and continued delivery of annual growth featuring both
our award-winning distribution power generation turn-key contract services and
emerging wind turbine production. As China has demonstrated its economic
resilience throughout the global financial crisis and renewed its growth
momentum driven by further infrastructure build-out and rapid urbanization,
power generation continues to stay in the lime light. Whether our DG micro-grid
to complement often stressed state grids, or our large wind turbines to provide
better economies of scale, A-Power focuses on bringing the best cost-effective
solutions to the marketplace. While we are aligning our strategic positions in
Japan and US, our goal remains intact by leveraging best-of-breed renewable
technologies to benefit the vast end users and maximize our shareholders’
long-term value."

in the 2009 fourth quarter increased to $125.9 million from $81.4 million from

    For the
fiscal year 2009, net revenue increased year-over-year by 17.5% to $311.3
million.
     
    Gross
profit increased 38.5% to $51.1 million from $36.9 million in 2008. Gross margin
was 16.4% compared with 13.9% in the same period of 2008. The increase in
gross margin was mainly attributable to sales of 2.7MW wind turbines which carry
higher gross margin.
     
    Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $12.8 million, compared with $8.7
million in 2008. The increase was mainly due to all activities related
to the Evatech acquisition, the Texas wind farm project and Nevada assembly
facility location selection.
     
    Operating
income in 2009 rose 35.7% to $38.2 million from $29.0 million in
2008.  The increased income was generated by higher gross profit
partially offset by higher operating expenses.
     
    Excluding the expenses and
non-cash losses related to the convertible bond and warrants, Non-GAAP
net income was $36.1 million, or $1.05 earnings per share, compared with
$28.5 million and $0.94 earnings per share in 2008.
     
    GAAP net
loss was $16.7 million, compared with net income of $28.5 million in
2008.
     
    Key
2009 Milestones
    
    In March
2009, A-Power entered into a supply agreement and a joint venture partnership
agreement with GE Drivetrain Technologies, a unit of GE Transportation to
manufacture 2.7 megawatt (MW) wind turbine gearboxes.
    
    In June
2009, Shenyang Municipal Government approved in principal to form Shenyang Power
Group with A-Power as the lead investor. In addition, the Shenyang government
will provide a total of RMB 100 million of subsidies. The Shenyang Power Group
intends to expand and strengthen the distributed power generation system
construction business of the Company because it will upgrade and strengthen the
whole capacity of the Company to undertake more business.
    
    In
September 2009, the Company signed a definitive contract to acquire 100% of
EVATECH Co., Ltd. (“EVATECH”) of Kyoto, Japan, a 22-year-old designer and
manufacturer of industrial equipment for LCDs (liquid crystal displays), PDPs
(plasma display panels) and, more recently, amorphous-silicon (a-Si)
photovoltaic (PV) panels.
    
    In
December 2009, A-Power and SPG signed agreements with Pakistan Amraas
International Private Limited ("Amraas") on two separate DG projects in
Pakistan. The first project entails the construction and operation of two 25
megawatt (MW) biomass power plants for Amraas. The total value of the contract
is estimated to be $120 million (RMB 816 million). The second project concerns a
geothermal project for the Pakistan Parliament Building (753,480 square feet)
between SPG and Amraas International.
    
    In
December 2009, SPG established a Delaware Limited company (“Project Company”)
with United States Renewable Energy Group Wind Partners I, LLC ("USREG Wind").
The Project Company will own, design, develop, construct, manage and operate a
wind energy power plant to be located in Texas with a total nameplate capacity
of 600MW (the "Project"). The Company has been designated to supply turbines to
the Project.
    
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
          
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
     
    Recent
Developments
    
    In
January 2010, A-Power signed a technology license agreement with German wind
turbine design company, W2E Technologies GmbH ("W2E Technologies") to
manufacture, operate, service and sell T8x 2.0 MW wind turbines. Under the
license agreement, W2E Technologies granted A-Power an exclusive right to
manufacture, operate, service and sell T8x 2.0 MW wind turbines in China and the
United States starting in January 2010. In addition, A-Power has obtained
non-exclusive rights to market T8x products outside of China and the United
States.
    
    In March,
2010, EVATECH signed a definitive contract with a Chinese leading renewable
energy company to supply one set of photovoltaic solar machines. The contract
covers the design, manufacturing and installation of the photovoltaic solar
machine. The total value of the contract is $1.7 million. A down payment has
been received with shipment expected by May 31, 2010.
     
    Outlook
for the Fiscal Year 2010
     
    For
fiscal year 2010, the management is expecting net sales to be approximately $380
million and net income to be approximately $45 million. These targets are based
on the Company’s current views on the operating and market conditions, which are
subject to change.
     
    Mr. Lu
concluded, "As our DG solution continues to extend its growth track record and
win customers in China and aboard, our wind business is picking up speed. While
Chinese domestic customers remain interested in large wind turbines with proven
records, our involvement in the Texas wind farm development paved the way for
our foray into the much larger US wind energy market. We see an exciting 2010
ahead of us."

    Use
of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     
    We have
provided fourth quarter 2008 and 2009, as well as the fiscal year 2008 and the
fiscal year 2009 net income and earnings (or loss) per share on a non-GAAP
basis, which is the GAAP net income adjusted by adding back accretion expenses
on convertible debt, loss on change in fair value of warrants, loss on change in
fair value of embedded derivative related to convertible notes, make-whole
amount paid on conversion, and fair value of inducement issued to convertible
notes holders to convert. We believe both management and investors benefit from
referring to these non-GAAP measures in assessing our business operation and
financial performance. These non-GAAP operating measures are useful for
understanding and assessing underlying business performance and operating
trends.
