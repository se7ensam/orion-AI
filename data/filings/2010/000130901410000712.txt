<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-size: 11pt"><B>51job, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2010 Financial Results</B></FONT>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>SHANGHAI, China, November&nbsp;9, 2010 </B>&#150; <B>51job, Inc. (Nasdaq: JOBS)</B>, a leading provider of integrated
human resource services in China, announced today unaudited financial results for the third quarter
of 2010 ended September&nbsp;30, 2010.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Third Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights:</B>
<BR>
&#150; Total revenues increased 23.7% over Q3 2009 to RMB271.6&nbsp;million (US$40.6&nbsp;million), exceeding the
Company&#146;s guidance range of RMB255&nbsp;million to RMB265&nbsp;million
<BR>
&#150; Online recruitment services revenues increased 58.4% over Q3 2009 to RMB142.7&nbsp;million (US$21.3
million)
<BR>
&#150; Gross margin expanded to 68.4% compared with 62.4% in Q3 2009
<BR>
&#150; Operating income increased 72.0% to RMB68.9&nbsp;million (US$10.3&nbsp;million) compared with RMB40.1
million in Q3 2009
<BR>
&#150; Fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB1.10 (US$0.33 per ADS)
<BR>
&#150; Excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation loss as well as
their related tax impact, non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB1.26
(US$0.38 per ADS), exceeding the Company&#146;s guidance range of RMB0.95 to RMB1.05
<BR>
&#150; Cash and short-term investments increased to RMB1,512.6&nbsp;million (US$226.1&nbsp;million) as of
September&nbsp;30, 2010


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, Inc., said,
&#147;Through the successful execution of our growth initiatives, we achieved record revenues and
profits in the third quarter. In our online business, we continued to aggressively acquire new
corporate customers, expand our geographic sales coverage and introduce product innovations. We
also saw solid progress in the development of our other HR services area led by increasing customer
adoption of our outsourcing services. With this robust business momentum on our side, we remain
focused on taking actions to extend our market leadership position, investing for our long-term
growth and creating value for our shareholders.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Third Quarter 2010 Unaudited Financial Results</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Total revenues for the third quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 were RMB271.6&nbsp;million (US$40.6
million), an increase of 23.7% from RMB219.6&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Print advertising revenues for the third quarter of 2010 decreased 19.6% to RMB62.0&nbsp;million (US$9.3
million) compared with RMB77.1&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009. The decline was primarily due
to a reduction in the number of cities where <I>51job Weekly </I>is published, from 22 cities as of
September&nbsp;30, 2009 to 16 cities as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, which resulted in a 33.3% decrease in the
estimated number of print advertising pages generated in the third quarter of 2010 to 2,143
compared with 3,213 pages in the same quarter in 2009. However, although print advertising prices
in each city were largely unchanged, overall average revenue per page in the third quarter of 2010
increased 20.5% as compared to the same quarter of the prior year due to an increase in page volume
contribution from higher priced cities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Online recruitment services revenues for the third quarter of 2010 were RMB142.7&nbsp;million (US$21.3
million), representing a 58.4% increase from RMB90.1&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The increase primarily resulted from a greater number of unique employers using the
Company&#146;s online recruitment services. Driven by greater customer usage of online recruitment
services and sales expansion into new geographies, unique employers increased 55.9% to 142,098 in
the third quarter of 2010 compared with 91,167 in the same quarter of the prior year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Other human resource related revenues for the third quarter of 2010 increased 27.8% to RMB66.9
million (US$10.0&nbsp;million) from RMB52.4&nbsp;million in the same quarter of 2009 primarily due to greater
market demand for our business process outsourcing, training and executive search services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Gross profit for the third quarter of 2010 increased 35.8% to RMB176.1&nbsp;million (US$26.3&nbsp;million)
from RMB129.7&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is gross profit
as a percentage of net revenues, expanded to 68.4% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 62.4%
in the same quarter in 2009 primarily due to greater economies of scale, improved efficiency and a
decrease in printing-related expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were RMB107.2&nbsp;million (US$16.0&nbsp;million) compared
with RMB89.6&nbsp;million for the same quarter of 2009. Sales and marketing expenses for the third
quarter of 2010 increased 28.8% to RMB68.5&nbsp;million (US$10.2&nbsp;million) from RMB53.2&nbsp;million for the
same quarter of the prior year primarily due to an increase in salaries and commissions resulting
from higher sales and headcount additions as well as greater advertising expenses. General and
administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2010 increased 6.1% to RMB38.7&nbsp;million (US$5.8
million) compared with RMB36.5&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of higher employee
compensation expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Income from operations for the third quarter of 2010 increased 72.0% to RMB68.9&nbsp;million (US$10.3
million) from RMB40.1&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. Operating margin, which is
income from operations as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 26.8% in the third quarter of
2010 compared with 19.3% in the same quarter of 2009. The reduction in the effective tax rate to
16.1% in the third quarter of 2010 from 30.1% in the third quarter of 2009 was primarily due to the
qualification of an operating entity as a High and New Technology Enterprise in December&nbsp;2009,
which became subject to a preferential tax rate of 15%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Net income for the third quarter of 2010 increased 75.3% to RMB62.9&nbsp;million (US$9.4&nbsp;million) from
RMB35.9&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the
third quarter of 2010 were RMB1.10 (US$0.16) compared with RMB0.65 for the same quarter in 2009.
Fully diluted earnings per ADS for the third quarter of 2010 were RMB2.20 (US$0.33) compared with
RMB1.29 in the third quarter of 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">In the third quarter of 2010, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB6.4&nbsp;million (US$1.0&nbsp;million) compared with RMB6.5&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2009. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation loss of RMB2.7&nbsp;million (US$0.4&nbsp;million) in
the third quarter of 2010 compared with RMB86,000 in the third quarter of 2009 due to an
appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of income before
income tax expense, income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share and
adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude share-based
compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss as well as their related tax
impact. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense and its related tax impact
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company&#146;s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company&#146;s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss and its related tax impact
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation
gain or loss is not indicative of the Company&#146;s core business operations and will not result in
cash settlement nor impact the Company&#146;s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP
measures excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss
and their related tax impact are important in helping investors to understand the Company&#146;s current
financial performance and future prospects and to compare business trends among different reporting
periods on a consistent basis. The presentation of these additional measures should not be
considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported
or forecasted by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in
the attached financial statements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Safe Harbor Statement</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Statements in this release regarding targets for the fourth quarter of 2010, future business and
operating results constitute &#147;forward-looking&#148; statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon management&#146;s current expectations, and actual
results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are
the number of recruitment advertisements placed, sales orders received and customer contracts
executed during the remaining weeks of the fourth quarter of 2010; any accounting adjustments that
may occur during the quarterly close; fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S.
dollar and other currencies; behavioral and operational changes of customers in meeting their human
resource needs as they respond to evolving social, economic and political changes in China as well
as stock market volatilities; introduction by its competitors of new or enhanced products or
services; price competition in the market for the various human resource services that the Company
provides in China; acceptance of new products and services developed or introduced by the Company
outside of the human resources industry and fluctuations in general economic conditions. For
additional information on these and other factors that may affect the Company&#146;s financial results,
please refer to the Company&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 51job
