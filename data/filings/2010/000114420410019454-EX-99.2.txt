Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
     
    On
January 25, 2010, A-Power Energy Generation Company Ltd.(“A-Power” or the
“Company”), through its wholly owned subsidiary Liaoning Gaoke Energy group
company Ltd.(“Gaoke Energy”), completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of
EVATECH Co., Ltd. (“Evatech”) for cash consideration of approximately $49.9
million. Due to certain financial difficulties with the operation of its
business, Evatech was the subject of a rehabilitation process in the courts of
Japan related to its corporate and debt restructuring that began in November,
2008 and ended with A-Power’s acquisition of Evatech
     
    The
following unaudited pro forma condensed Combined Financial Statements are based
on the historical financial statements of A-Power and Evatech after giving
effect to the assumptions, reclassifications, and adjustments described in the
accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statement.
     
    The
acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Section
805 of the FASB Codification.  Under the acquisition method of
accounting, the total purchase consideration of the acquisition is allocated to
the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed
based on their relative fair values.  The excess of the purchase
consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is
recorded as goodwill.  The purchase price allocation is preliminary
since the valuation of the intangible assets is still being
finalized.  Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments related to the
purchase price allocation and certain other adjustments are preliminary and have
been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements.  Any revisions to the purchase price
allocation are not expected to have a material impact on the statement of
operations, except as these adjustments may relate to any intangible assets, for
which the Company has yet to identify and assign a final fair
value.
     
    The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are prepared by
management for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of
future results or of actual results that would have been achieved had the
acquisition been consummated as of the dates presented, and should not be taken
as representative of future consolidated results or operations of financial
position of the company.

    The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included herein have
been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Certain information and certain footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations; however, management believes that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
     
    The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2009,
and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, presented herein, are based on the
historical financial statements of A-Power and Evatech.
     
    Because
of different fiscal period ends, information is presented as outlined
below:

              The
      unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31,
      2009 is presented as if A-Power’s acquisition of Evatech had occurred on
      December 31, 2009, and combines the historical balance sheet of A-Power as
      of December 31, 2009 with the historical balance sheet of Evatech as of
      August 31, 2009.

              The
      unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the
      fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 is presented as if A-Power’s
      acquisition of Evatech had occurred on January 1, 2009, and combines
      A-Power’s historical statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
      December 31, 2009 with Evatech’s historical statement of operations for
      the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.  Evatech’s historical
      statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was
      derived by taking Evatech’s historical results of operations for the year
      ended August 31, 2009, subtracting Evatech’s historical results of
      operations for the four months ended December 31, 2008 and adding
      Evatech’s historical results of operations for the four months ended
      December 31, 2009.

              Acquisition
      of Evatech
            
          
      
    
     
    On
September 16, 2009, the Company signed an agreement to acquire 100% of EVATECH
Co., Ltd. ("Evatech") of Kyoto, Japan, a 22-year-old designer and manufacturer
of industrial equipment for LCDs (liquid crystal displays), PDPs (plasma display
panels) and, amorphous-silicon (a-Si) photovoltaic (PV) panels. The total
consideration was $49.9 million in cash. On January 25, 2010, the Company
paid $49.9 million to close the acquisition. The acquisition is accounted for
under the acquisition method of accounting.
     
    Under the
acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price is
allocated to Evatech’s net tangible and intangible assets based on their
relative estimated fair values at the date of the completion of the acquisition.
The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation of the
purchase price for Evatech and the estimated useful lives for the acquired
intangible assets (in thousands):

    Inventories
were decreased to their estimated fair value, which represented an amount
equivalent to estimated selling prices less distribution related costs and a
normative selling profit. Inventory reserves totaling $1.8 million and had been
included in cost of goods sold in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of operations.
     
    Property,
plant and equipment were written down to their estimated fair values, resulting
in an impairment charge totaling $5 million.
     
    Evatech
entered into a rehabilitation process and re-organized its debt. Evatech’s debt
approximated $44.7 million, of which approximately $25.3 million was forgiven by
Evatech’s debtors and the remaining $19.3 million was paid from the $49.9
million cash received on the acquisition of Evatech’s shares.
     
    Upon
completion of the fair value assessment, A-Power anticipates that the final
purchase price allocation will differ from the preliminary assessment provided
above. Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the assets and
liabilities will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities in
accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.

              Intangible
      assets were segregated into the categories of Trademarks and Patents,
      Technology and Licenses (collectively, the “Intangible Assets”) and were
      assigned aggregated values of $3.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
      The Intangible Assets were valued at the relative estimated net present
      value of expected future cash flows derived from such Intangible
      Assets.

              The
      estimated useful life of Intangible Assets is 10 years. Amortization
      expense on Intangible Assets reflected in the unaudited pro forma
      condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
      December 31, 2009 totaled $0.9

  Adjustments
            
          
      
    
     
    The
following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements, all net of tax effects:
     
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              a.
            
            
              To
      record the net proceeds of approximately $79.0 million of the offering to
      sell certain institutional investors 5,777,932 of A-Power’s common shares
      at a price of $14.37 per share on January 21, 2010 and $49.9 million cash
      paid to acquire 100% of Evatech’s common
shares.
            
          
      
    
     
    
      
          
            
               
      
            
            
              b.
            
            
              To
      record the cost of Evatech’s intangible assets to fair value; total value
      of intangible assets amounted to $8.9 million, bringing the deferred
      tax liabilities of $3.7 million, correspondingly, which caused a total
      loss of $5.1 million in pro forma condensed combined financial statements
      as a result of the decrease of $8.9 million in general and administrative
      expense partially offset by $3.7 million income
  tax.

              To
      reduce the cost of Evatech’s property, plant and equipment to fair value;
      impairment loss on property, plant and equipment totaled $5.1 million,
      including a $2.2 million impairment loss on the land, was booked in
      Evatech’s income statement for the year ended December 31, 2009 and was
      ignored for the pro forma adjustment of pro forma condensed combined

    For the
year ended December 31, 2009, transaction cost incurred related to the

A-Power. These costs have been recorded as a pro forma adjustment to increase
general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2009.
     
    
      
         

      
      
         

        
          
        
      
      
         

      
    
    The
combined business may incur charges to operations that A-Power cannot reasonably
estimate, in the quarter in which the purchase is completed or the following
quarters, to reflect costs associated with integrating the two businesses. In
addition, the combined business may incur additional charges relating to the
transaction in subsequent periods, which could have a material impact on
A-Power’s financial position or results of operations.
