Forward-Looking Statements
Forward-Looking Statements:  
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.  These  statements may be identified by the use of words like
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” 
“forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,”
“seek,” and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, 
statements as to the approximate value of the contract award, expectations as to the
Group’s performance in 2010, expectations as to Acergy’s approach to costs,
risk, pricing, execution and position and direction of the market in 2011, the continued 
commercial negotiations relating to the Marathon Volund Project, the impact of the sale and
deconsolidation of the Sonamet joint  venture, expectations regarding our backlog and
pre-backlog, statements regarding the trading outlook, including our visibility  for
2010 and 2011, the expected impact of a continued competitive pricing environment, the anticipated Conventional activity 
levels in West Africa, the anticipation that delayed major SURF contracts will come to market
and the timing of the offshore  installation phase of such projects, the expectation for
SURF contracts to increase in size and complexity in the medium-term,  our ability
to capture growth opportunities, the expected timing for completion of the proposed Combination with Subsea 7 Inc., 
the composition of the Board of Directors of the combined Company and the expected date of the
Extraordinary General Meeting  of shareholders to consider the Combination. The
forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are 
subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in
our public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are
among those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ  materially
from our forward-looking statements: actions by regulatory authorities or other third parties; unanticipated costs and 
difficulties related to the integration of Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7 Inc. and our ability to
achieve benefits therefrom; unanticipated delays, costs and difficulties related to the
combination transaction, including satisfaction of closing conditions; our ability to 
recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the
markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients;
the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries;
uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and
the timely completion of ship  conversion programmes; the impact of laws and
regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage.  
Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Given these factors,
you should not place undue reliance on  the forward-looking statements. 
 
This communication does not constitute an offer to purchase, sell, or exchange or the
solicitation of an offer to sell, purchase, or  exchange any securities of Subsea 7 or
Acergy.  Certain statements made in this announcement may include
“forward-looking statements”

Medium-term
fundamentals
remain
strong 
The oil price continues to build confidence in the industry and 
underpins momentum in our sector
SURF environment is improving:
First of the large SURF contracts awarded, including CLOV to Acergy
Continue to see strong tendering activity worldwide and good growth 
potential
Anticipate
a
number
of
major
contracts
coming
to
award
late
2010
and
in 
2011 in West Africa, China, Brazil, Australia and other countries
Given the size and complexity of these new major SURF projects –
offshore installation expected to commence beyond 2011 and in some 
cases beyond 2012
Could see some delays in the award of major SURF projects in Gulf of 
Mexico 


  




 

seabed-to-surface
October 13, 2010
slide 6
North Sea activity visibility remains somewhat
Significant increase in tendering, especially in the UK
Projects remain slow to come to award in Norway
Pricing environment for shorter-term work remains competitive
Project awards in 2010 expected to create margin headwind in 2011 
limited

October 13, 2010
slide 7
Conventional
and
hook-up
activity
remains
strong
Conventional and hook-up activity in West Africa expected to remain 
strong in short and medium-term
Acergy’s substantial local presence remains a competitive strength
Supports continuity of activity and maintains good level of backlog
Further activity expected over the next 12 months at good margins

slide 8
Maintain
a
disciplined
approach
to
costs,
risk
and
pricing
–
building 
quality backlog and executing strongly
2011
–
a
year
of
transition:
Good level of activity anticipated
Prior year delays in project awards and competitive market for shorter-
term work could see some impact on overall margins in 2011
New contract awards will drive backlog and momentum
Improvement in margins on these new contracts anticipated but positive  
impact of this ramp up visible in 2012 and beyond
Acergy
in 2011

Adjusted EBITDA
(a) 
Adjusted EBITDA:  
income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus
finance costs, other gains  and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and
adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of  property, plant and equipment
and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted
EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations.  Management believes that Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of
our operational strength and the performance of our  business. Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in  accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the 
European Union.  These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful
comparison amongst our various  regions, as they eliminate the effects of financing and
depreciation.  Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations  may also be a
useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and 
analysts following the Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margin from continuing  operations as presented by the Group may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies.   Such supplementary
adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations 
adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to
reports filed under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934.  Accordingly, the SEC may
require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from  continuing operations be
presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be 
presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are
not measures determined  in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an
alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as  determined in accordance with
IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as 
determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity.  The
reconciliation of the Group’s net  income from continuing operations to Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this release.  This release also
includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net operating 
income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges
on property, plant and  equipment and intangibles.  Management believes that this
supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from  continuing operations is also useful
as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies 
within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for
those evaluating companies within  Acergy’s industry.  Adjusted EBITDA for
discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above.   Adjusted
EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.
