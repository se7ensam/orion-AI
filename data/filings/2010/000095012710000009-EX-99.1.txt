               Acergy S.A. Announces Extraordinary General Meeting

London, England - January 13, 2010 - Acergy S.A. (NASDAQ-GS: ACGY; Oslo Stock
Exchange: ACY) announced today that an Extraordinary Meeting of Shareholders
(the "Meeting") will take place at the offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route d'Esch,
L-2086 Luxembourg on Tuesday February 16, 2010 at 12.00 p.m. local time for the
purpose of considering resolution 1 of the December 17, 2009 Extraordinary
General Meeting Agenda.

It was noted at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on December
17, 2009 that the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for
resolution 1 was not present and this Meeting was therefore not able to consider
this resolution.

The Board of Directors therefore decided to call an Extraordinary General
Meeting to consider resolution 1. At this Meeting there is no requirement for
quorum. However, to approve the proposed resolution a 2/3rd majority of the
votes cast at the Meeting will be required.

Proxies already received for the December 17, 2009 Extraordinary General Meeting
remain valid for this Meeting and Shareholders of record as of October 30, 2009
are entitled to vote at the Meeting. Those Shareholders who have not yet cast
their votes may do so by submitting the proxy card as instructed, or
alternatively may attend the Meeting at the above address. The new deadline for
submission of votes for American Depositary Receipt holders is February 8, 2010
and for holders of Common Shares February 9, 2010.

Upon publication, the supporting materials for this meeting will be available on
the Acergy website: www.acergy-group.com/public/February2010EGM
