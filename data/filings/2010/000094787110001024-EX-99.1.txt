Projected Results for FY2010 (April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011)
      
      (Note)
Revision of earnings forecast for this period: None
      Advantest
focuses primarily on the business of test systems for semiconductors and
Advantest’s business relies heavily on the capital expenditures of semiconductor
manufacturers, test houses and foundries.  The capital expenditures of
these companies are determined primarily by factors such as current or future
trends in the demand for semiconductors.  At this time, Advantest is
unable to provide the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31,
2011 due to difficulty in forecasting trends in the demand for semiconductors
and investment plans for semiconductor related capital
expenditures.  Advantest intends to promptly disclose the relevant
earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes possible.

        In the
second quarter of FY2010, despite weakening consumer sentiment primarily due to
financial uncertainties in developed economies, the overall recovery trend
continued, led by rapid growth in China and the other emerging countries
economies.
        Capital
spending from semiconductor manufacturers was strong at the beginning of the
period responding to demand for consumer electronics including smartphones,
tablet computers with touch panel, and televisions with 3D / LED backlight
functionality. However, in the latter half of the period, certain customers
postponed capital investment or limited equipment orders, reacting to weaker
consumer electronics and PC demand.
        Amid
these shifts, Advantest strove to secure orders and expand sales. While orders
input received declined primarily due to the deteriorating market environment as
compared to the previous quarter, sales and earnings increased, but did not meet
expectations in comparison to the company’s earlier forecast.
        As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 23.3 billion (a 61.2%
increase in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year),
net sales were (Y) 28.6 billion (a 156.0% increase in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), operating income was (Y) 2.9
billion ((Y) 6.4 billion improvement in comparison to the corresponding period
of the previous fiscal year), income before income taxes and equity in earnings
of affiliated company was (Y) 2.5 billion ((Y) 5.2 billion improvement in
comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year), net income
was (Y) 1.8 billion ((Y) 5.1 billion improvement in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). The percentage of net sales
to overseas customers was 82.5%, compared to 75.9% in the corresponding period
of the previous fiscal year.

        In the
Semiconductor and Component Test System Segment, although orders did not reach
the level of the previous quarter, overall results were healthy, supported by
semiconductor manufacturers’ motivation to invest for new capacity
expansions.
        In the
memory semiconductor test system, the mainstream adoption of DDR3-DRAM kept pace
with advances in computing performance, supporting strong demand for Advantest’s
high-speed memory test systems. Additionally, a significant rise in demand for
the low-power DRAM chips used in smartphones and other portable devices drove
strong sales of high-throughput memory test systems.
        In the
non-memory semiconductor test system, test systems for microprocessors used in
PCs and portable and wireless devices posted growth, but test systems for LCD
driver ICs declined slightly.
        As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 17.1 billion (a 123.0%
increase in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year),
net sales were (Y) 20.2 billion (a 181.7% increase in comparison to the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year) and operating income was (Y)
3.5 billion ((Y) 5.7 billion improvement in comparison to the corresponding
period of the previous fiscal year).

        Even

satisfactory sales of the device interface products and test handlers used
together with test systems.

Analysis of Financial Condition
        Total
assets at September 30, 2010 amounted to (Y) 183.0 billion, a decrease of (Y)
5.7 billion compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to a decrease of (Y) 29.4
billion in cash and cash equivalents, increase of (Y) 11.7 billion and (Y) 9.1
billion in short-term investments and trade receivables, respectively. The
amount of total liabilities was (Y) 44.8 billion, an increase of (Y) 6.4 billion
compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in trade accounts
payable. Stockholders’ equity was (Y) 138.2 billion. Equity to assets ratio was
75.5%, a decrease of 4.1 percentage point from March 31, 2010.
        
        (Cash
Flow Condition)
        Cash and
cash equivalents held at September 30, 2010 were (Y) 67.1 billion, a decrease of
(Y) 17.8 billion from June 30, 2010. Significant cash flows during the second
quarter of this fiscal year and their causes are described below.
        Net cash
provided by operating activities was (Y) 0.2 billion (Net cash outflow (Y) 2.1
billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount
was primarily attributable to net income in the amount of (Y) 1.8 billion,
increase in trade accounts payable in the amount of (Y) 4.0 billion, increase in
trade receivables in the amount of (Y) 5.8 billion and adjustments of the profit
and loss of non-fund items such as depreciation and amortization.
        Net cash
used in investing activities was (Y) 7.6 billion (Net cash inflow (Y) 4.2
billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount
was primarily attributable to increase in short-term investments in the amount
of (Y) 6.9 billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount
of (Y) 0.7 billion.
        Net cash
used in financing activities was (Y) 10.3 billion (Net cash outflow (Y) 49
million in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year). This amount
was primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock.

Prospects for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
        Despite
financial uncertainties and currency volatility that threaten to undermine
prospects for long-term growth, stimulus measures bolstering demand, as well as
growth in the emerging economies, have kept the global economic recovery on
track since 2009.
        Global
semiconductor sales for 2010 are on track to surpass the previous peak attained
in 2007. Moreover, predictions of increased worldwide consumer spending on PCs,
cellular phones and other consumer electronics underpin the consensus forecast
that the semiconductor industry will continue to grow in the medium term. These
expectations are encouraging semiconductor manufacturers to continue adding new
capacity and advanced capabilities. Nevertheless, there is a trend towards
extreme caution in individual capital investment decisions, making it difficult
to predict the timing and scale of new test system purchases.
        Advantest’s
drive to boost earnings by accurately responding to diverse customer needs with
new products, services, and support is fueled by the company’s core competence –
its well-established technological edge. The company will continue to refine its
business model for stable growth by enhancing the efficiency of R&D and
manufacturing processes to cut costs, developing new businesses, and
diversifying its revenue sources.
        As noted
on the Information Summary sheet, Advantest has not yet disclosed a forecast of
its full fiscal year results for FY2010. Such data will be disclosed promptly
when it becomes available.
