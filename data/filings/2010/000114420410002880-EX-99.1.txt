    (a)         No Public Sale or
Distribution.  Such Buyer is (i) acquiring the Shares and the

issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, in each case, for its own account and
not with a view towards, or for resale in connection with, the public sale or

making the representations herein, such Buyer does not agree to hold any of the
Securities for any minimum or other specific term and reserves the right to
dispose of the Securities at any time in accordance with or pursuant to a
registration statement or an exemption under the 1933 Act.  Such Buyer

    (b)         Status of
Buyer.  Such Buyer is either (i) a "qualified institutional
buyer" as that term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act or, (ii) if such
Buyer has indicated on its signature page to this Agreement that is purchasing
the Shares and the Warrants pursuant to Regulation S, not a "U.S. Person" as
such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S.  If such Buyer has
indicated on its signature page that it is purchasing the Shares and the
Warrants pursuant to Regulation S, such Buyer
(i) is acquiring the Shares and the Warrants in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S,
(ii) is acquiring the Shares and the Warrants for such Buyer's own account,
(iii) is not and will not be a "distributor" as such term is defined in Rule 902
of Regulation S and (iv) understands that the Shares and the Warrants may
not, absent an applicable exemption, be transferred without registration and/or

laws of any other applicable jurisdiction.
     
    (c)         Reliance on
Exemptions.  Such Buyer understands that the Securities are
being offered and sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the
registration requirements of United States federal and state securities laws and
that the Company is relying in part upon the truth and accuracy of, and such
Buyer's compliance with, the representations, warranties, agreements,
acknowledgments and understandings of such Buyer set forth herein in order to
determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of such Buyer
to acquire the Securities.
     
    (d)         Information.  Such
Buyer and its advisors, if any, have been furnished with all materials relating
to the business, finances and operations of the Company and materials relating
to the offer and sale of the Securities that have been requested by such
Buyer.  Such Buyer and its advisors, if any, have been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Company and to
obtain any additional information which the Company possesses or can acquire
without undue effort or expense, and all such questions have been answered to
the satisfaction of such Buyer.  Neither such inquiries nor any other
due diligence investigations conducted by such Buyer or its advisors, if any, or
its representatives shall modify, amend or affect such Buyer's right to rely on
the Company's representations and warranties contained herein.  Such
Buyer understands that its investment in the Securities involves a high degree
of risk.  Such Buyer has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice
as it has considered necessary to make an informed investment decision with
respect to its acquisition of the Securities.  Such Buyer understands
that the Placement Agent (as defined in Section 3(g)) has acted solely as the
agent of the Company in this offering of the Securities and such Buyer has not
relied on the business or legal advice of the Placement Agent or any of its
agents, counsel or affiliates in making its investment decision hereunder, and
confirms that none of such Persons has made any representations or warranties to
such Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.
     
    (e)         No Governmental
Review.  Such Buyer understands that no United States federal
or state agency or any other government or governmental agency has passed on or
made any recommendation or endorsement of the Securities or the fairness or
suitability of the investment in the Securities nor have such authorities passed
upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Securities.

    (f)          Transfer or
Resale.  Such Buyer understands that except as provided in the
Registration Rights Agreement: (i) the Securities have not been and are not
being registered under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws, and may not be
offered for sale, sold, assigned or transferred unless (A) subsequently
registered thereunder, (B) such Buyer shall have delivered to the Company an
opinion of counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the
effect that such Securities to be sold, assigned or transferred may be sold,
assigned or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration, (C)
such Buyer provides the Company with reasonable assurance that such Securities
can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A
promulgated under the 1933 Act, as amended, (or a successor rule thereto)
(collectively, "Rule
144"), or (D) outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S
under the 1933 Act; (ii) any sale of the Securities made in reliance on Rule 144
may be made only in accordance with the terms of Rule 144 and further, if Rule
144 is not applicable, any resale of the Securities under circumstances in which
the seller (or the Person through whom the sale is made) may be deemed to be an
underwriter (as that term is defined in the 1933 Act) may require compliance
with some other exemption under the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder; and (iii) neither the Company nor any other Person
is under any obligation to register the Securities under the 1933 Act or any
state securities laws or to comply with the terms and conditions of any
exemption thereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securities
may be pledged in connection with a bona fide margin account or other loan or
financing arrangement secured by the Securities and such pledge of Securities
shall not be deemed to be a transfer, sale or assignment of the Securities
hereunder, and no Buyer effecting a pledge of Securities shall be required to
provide the Company with any notice thereof or otherwise make any delivery to
the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (as
defined in Section 3(b)), including, without limitation, this Section
2(f).

Buyer's review or input concerning such Person's investments or trading (the
foregoing, "Buyer Trading
Affiliates"), engaged in any sale or purchase in the securities of the
Company (including, without limitation, any Short Sales involving the Company's
securities) since the time that such Buyer was first contacted by the Company or
the Placement Agent regarding the investment in the Company contemplated herein
(the "Restricted
Period"). "Short Sales" include, without limitation, all "short sales" as
defined in Rule 200 promulgated under Regulation SHO under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") ("Regulation SHO") and all types
of direct and indirect stock pledges, forward sale contracts, options, puts,
calls, swaps and similar arrangements (including on a total return basis), and
sales and other transactions through non-U.S. broker dealers or foreign
regulated brokers (but shall not be deemed to include the location and/or
reservation of borrowable Common Shares).  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall constitute
a representation or warranty, or preclude any actions, with respect to (i) the
satisfaction, during the Restricted Period, of any contractual arrangements
entered into prior to the Restricted Period and (ii) the identification of the
availability of, or securing of, available shares to borrow in order to effect
short sales or similar transactions in the future.  Such Buyer is not

"beneficial owner" (as defined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of 1934 Act) of more than

the assumption that all Common Shares Equivalents (as defined in Section
4(n)(i)(1)) owned by such Buyer, whether or not presently exercisable or
convertible, have been fully exercised or converted (as the case may be) but
taking into account any limitations on exercise or conversion contained
therein).
     
    (l)          General
Solicitation.  Such Buyer is not purchasing the Securities as a
result of any advertisement, article, notice or other communication regarding
the Securities published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or
broadcast over television or radio or presented at any seminar or, to such Buyer's knowledge, any communications that
would constitute a general solicitation under Regulation D or "directed selling
efforts" under Regulation S.
     
    3.           REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.
     
    The
Company represents and warrants to each of the Buyers and the Placement Agent
that, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date:
     
    (a)         Organization and
Qualification.  Each of the Company and its "Subsidiaries" (which for
purposes of this Agreement means any entity in which the Company, directly or
indirectly, owns a majority of the capital stock or holds a majority of the
equity or similar interest) are entities duly organized and validly existing in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which they are formed, and
have the requisite power and authorization to own their properties and to carry
on their business as now being conducted.  Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign entity to do business and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except to
the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  As used in
this Agreement, "Material
Adverse Effect" means any material adverse effect on the business,
properties, assets, operations, results of operations, condition (financial or
otherwise) or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, individually or
taken as a whole, or on the transactions contemplated hereby or on the other
Transaction Documents or by the agreements and instruments to be entered into in
connection herewith or therewith, or on the authority or ability of the Company
to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents.  The
Company has no Subsidiaries except as set forth on Schedule
3(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entities in which the
Company, directly or indirectly, owns any of the capital shares or holds an
equity or similar interest which are not Subsidiaries, taken as whole, do not
have operations, income or assets which are material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  The Company hereby represents that
Shenyang Yixiang Wind Power Equipment Limited and Shenyang (Jinxiang) Gold Lucky
Electric Power Equipments Co., Ltd. ("Jinxiang") do not have any
operations, income or assets, except for $10,000,000 held by
Jinxiang..

enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Registration
Rights Agreement, the Voting Agreement (as defined in Section 4(q)), the Lock-Up
Agreements (as defined in Section 7(xiii)), the Irrevocable Transfer Agent
Instructions (as defined in Section 5(b)), the Warrants and each of the other
agreements entered into by the parties hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") to
which the Company is a party and to issue the Securities in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof.  The execution and delivery of the
Transaction Documents by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement or employs any member of a union.  The Company and its
Subsidiaries believe that their relations with their employees are
good.  No executive officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(as defined in Rule 501(f) of the 1933 Act) has notified the Company or any such
Subsidiary that such officer intends to leave the Company or any such Subsidiary
or otherwise terminate such officer's employment with the Company or any such
Subsidiary.  No executive officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is, or
is now expected to be, in violation of any material term of any employment
contract, confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement,
non-competition agreement, or any other contract or agreement or any restrictive
covenant, and the continued employment of each such executive officer, to the
Company's knowledge, does not subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters.
     
    (ii)           The
Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all federal, state, local
and foreign laws and regulations respecting labor, employment and employment
practices and benefits, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours,
except where failure to be in compliance would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.
     
    (w)        Title. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have land use rights as permitted under China law with
respect to all real property and good and marketable title to all personal
property owned by them which is material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects
except such as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not
interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries.   Any real property and
facilities held under lease by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries are held
by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as
are not material and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made
of such property and buildings by the Company and its Subsidiaries.
     
    (x)         Intellectual Property
Rights.  The Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess
adequate rights or licenses to use all trademarks, trade names, service marks,
service mark registrations, service names, original works of authorship,
patents, patent rights, copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals,
governmental authorizations, trade secrets and other intellectual property
rights and all applications and registrations therefor ("Intellectual Property Rights")
necessary to conduct their respective businesses as now conducted, except for
any such Intellectual Property Rights the non-ownership or non-possession of
which would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  All of the Company's material Intellectual Property Rights
and relevant applications therefor have been duly registered by the China Patent
and Trademark Office, or the equivalent offices of non-US jurisdictions, and
have been properly maintained in accordance with applicable law in China and
such other jurisdictions.  None of the Company's material Intellectual
Property Rights have expired or terminated or have been abandoned or are
expected to expire or terminate or are expected to be abandoned, within three
years from the date of this Agreement.  The Company does not have any
knowledge of any infringement by the Company or its Subsidiaries of Intellectual
Property Rights of others.  There is no claim, action or proceeding
being made or brought, or to the knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, being threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
regarding its material Intellectual Property Rights.  Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any facts or circumstances which
might give rise to any of the foregoing infringements or claims, actions or
proceedings.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
security measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all of
their Intellectual Property Rights.

all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable
Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses and (iii) are in
compliance with all terms and conditions of any such permit, license or approval
where, in each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the failure to so
comply and receive any such permit, license or other approval could be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.  The term "Environmental Laws"
means, to the extent such laws apply to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, all federal, state, local or foreign laws relating to
pollution or protection of human health or the environment (including, without
limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface
strata), including, without limitation, laws relating to emissions, discharges,
releases or threatened releases of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, or toxic
or hazardous substances or wastes (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") into the environment, or
otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment,
storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials, as well as all
authorizations, codes, decrees, demands or demand letters, injunctions,

law) to receive dividends and distributions on, all capital securities of its
Subsidiaries as owned by the Company or such Subsidiary.
     
    (aa)         Investment Company
Status.  The Company is not, and upon consummation of the sale
of the Securities, and for so long any Buyer holds any Securities, will not be,

"affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an
"investment company" as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act
of  1940, as amended.
     
    (bb)         Tax

which it is subject, (ii) has paid all taxes and other governmental assessments
and charges that are material in amount, shown or determined to be due on such
returns, reports and declarations, except those being contested in good faith
and (iii) has set aside on its books provision reasonably adequate for the
payment of all taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such
returns, reports or declarations apply, except in each case where the failure to
file, pay or set aside would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.  There are no unpaid taxes in any material amount
claimed to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, and the officers
of the Company know of no basis for any such claim.

management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain asset and liability accountability, (iii) access to assets
or incurrence of liabilities is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets and liabilities is compared with the existing assets and liabilities at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
difference.  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act) that are effective
in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed,

reduce the value of the existing shareholders' equity interest in the Company
both at and after the time the hedging and/or trading activities are being
conducted.  The Company acknowledges that such aforementioned hedging
and/or trading activities do not constitute a breach of this Agreement, the
Warrants or any of the documents executed in connection herewith.

Company shall reimburse [ ] (a Buyer) or its designee(s) (in addition to any

    (h)           Pledge of
Securities.  The Company acknowledges and agrees that the
Securities may be pledged by an Investor in connection with a bona fide margin
agreement or other loan or financing arrangement that is secured by the

transfer, sale or assignment of the Securities hereunder except as may otherwise
be required under applicable securities laws, and no Investor effecting a pledge
of Securities shall be required to provide the Company with any notice thereof
or otherwise make any delivery to the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, including, without limitation, Section 2(f) hereof;
provided that an Investor and its pledgee shall be required to comply with the

to execute and deliver such documentation as a pledgee of the Securities may
reasonably request in connection with a pledge of the Securities to such pledgee
by an Investor.
     
    (i)            Disclosure of Transactions
and Other Material Information.  On or before 8:30 a.m., New

transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and file a Current Report
on Form 6-K describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents in the form required by the 1934 Act and attaching the
material Transaction Documents (including, without limitation, this Agreement,
the form of Warrant, the form the Registration Rights Agreement, the form of
Voting Agreement and the form of Lock-Up Agreement as exhibits to such filing)
(including all attachments, the "6-K Filing").  From
and after the filing of the 6-K Filing with the SEC, no Buyer shall be in
possession of any material, nonpublic information received from the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents, that is not disclosed in the Press Release.  The Company shall
not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents, not to, provide any Buyer
with any material, nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from and after the issuance of the Press Release with the SEC
without the prior express written consent of such Buyer.  If a Buyer
has, or believes it has, received any such material, nonpublic information
regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the Company or a "person"
acting on behalf of the Company" within the meaning of Rule 101(c) of Regulation
FD in breach of the immediately preceding sentence, it may provide the Company
with written notice thereof.  If the Company and its counsel agree
that such information is material, nonpublic information, the Company shall,
within two (2) Trading Days of receipt of such notice, make public disclosure of
such material, nonpublic information (the "MNPI
Disclosure").  In the event the Company fails to make the MNPI
Disclosure, in addition to any other remedy provided herein or in the
Transaction Documents, a Buyer shall have the right to make a public disclosure,
in the form of a press release, public advertisement or otherwise, of such
material, nonpublic information without the prior approval by the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents.  No Buyer shall have any liability to the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders or agents for any such disclosure.  Subject to the
foregoing, neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Buyer shall issue any
press releases or any other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled,
without the prior approval of any Buyer, to make any press release or other
public disclosure with respect to such transactions (i) in substantial
conformity with the 6-K Filing and contemporaneously therewith and (ii) as is
required by applicable law and regulations (provided that in the case of clause
(i) each Buyer shall be consulted by the Company in connection with any such
press release or other public disclosure prior to its
release).  Without the prior written consent of any applicable Buyer,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall disclose the
name of such Buyer in any filing (other than in the exhibits to the 6-K Filing),
announcement, release or otherwise, except as otherwise required by any law,
rule or regulation applicable to the Company after consultation with such
Buyer.

which varies or may vary with the market price of the Common Shares, including

applicable Exercise Price (as defined in the Warrants) with respect to the
Common Shares into which any Warrant is exercisable.
     
    (k)           Corporate
Existence.  So long as any Buyer beneficially owns any

party to any Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Warrants) unless the
Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing Fundamental
Transactions set forth in the Warrants.
     
    (l)            Reservation of
Shares.  So long as any Buyer owns any Securities, the Company
shall take all action necessary to at all times have authorized, and reserved
and maintained for the purpose of issuance, no less than 130% of the sum of the
number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants then outstanding
(without taking into account any limitations on the exercise of the Warrants set
forth in the Warrants).  If at any time the number of Common Shares
authorized and reserved and maintained for issuance is not sufficient to meet
the Required Reserved Amount, the Company will promptly take all corporate
action necessary to authorize and reserve and maintain for issuance a sufficient
number of shares, including, without limitation, calling a special meeting of
shareholders to authorize additional shares to meet the Company's obligations
under Section 3(c), in the case of an insufficient number of authorized shares,
obtain shareholder approval of an increase in such authorized number of shares
of the Company in favor of an increase in the authorized shares of the Company
to ensure that the number of authorized shares is sufficient to meet the
Required Reserved Amount.

statement is not available for the resale of all of the Registrable Securities,
at such time that all of the Securities may be sold without restriction or

with Rule 144(c)(1), if the Company shall fail for any reason to satisfy the
current public information requirement under Rule 144(c) (a "Public Information Failure")
then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder of Securities by reason of
any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell the Securities (which
remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in
equity), the Company shall pay to each such holder an amount in cash equal to
one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of such holder's

terms of such Warrant, the Company hereby covenant and agrees that it shall not
include any restrictive legend on any such Shares or Warrant Shares after the

INSTRUCTIONS.
     
    (a)           Register.  The
Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office
or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to each holder of
Securities), a register for the Shares and the Warrants in which the Company
shall record the name and address of the Person in whose name the Shares and the
Warrants have been issued (including the name and address of each transferee),
the number of Shares held by such Person, the number of Warrant Shares issuable
upon exercise of the Warrants held by such Person.  The Company shall
keep the register open and available at all times during business hours for
inspection of any Buyer or its legal representatives.
     
    (b)           Transfer Agent
Instructions.  The Company shall issue irrevocable instructions
to its transfer agent, and any subsequent transfer agent, to issue certificates
or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at the DTC, registered in
the name of each Buyer or its respective nominee(s), for the Shares and the
Warrant Shares issued at the Closing or upon exercise of the Warrants in such
amounts as specified in such amounts as specified from time to time by each
Buyer to the Company upon exercise of the Warrants in the form of Exhibit D (the "Irrevocable Transfer Agent
Instructions").  The Company warrants that no instruction other
than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section
5(b), and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(f) hereof, will
be given by the Company to its transfer agent, and that the Securities shall
otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and
to the extent provided in this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.  If a Buyer effects a sale, assignment or transfer of the
Securities in accordance with Section 2(f), the Company shall permit the
transfer and shall promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more
certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at DTC in such
name and in such denominations as specified by such Buyer to effect such sale,
transfer or assignment.  In the event that such sale, assignment or
transfer involves the Shares, Warrants or the Warrant Shares sold, assigned or
transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to Rule
144, the transfer agent shall issue such Securities to the Buyer, assignee or
transferee, as the case may be, without any restrictive legend.  In
the event that such sale, assignment or transfer involves the Shares or the
Warrant Shares sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Regulation S, the
transfer agent shall issue such Shares or Warrant Shares, as the case may be, to
the Buyer, assignee or transferee, as the case may be, without any restrictive
legend after the Distribution Compliance Period Termination Date.  The
Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause
irreparable harm to a Buyer.  Accordingly, the Company acknowledges
that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Section 5(b)
will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by
the Company of the provisions of this Section 5(b), that a Buyer shall be
entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an order and/or
injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate issuance and transfer,
without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other
security being required.

    8.           TERMINATION.  In
the event that the Closing shall not have occurred with respect to a Buyer on or
before five (5) Business Days from the date hereof due to the Company's or such
Buyer's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 above
(and the nonbreaching party's failure to waive such unsatisfied condition(s)),
the nonbreaching party shall have the option to terminate this Agreement with
respect to such breaching party at the close of business on such date without
liability of any party to any other party; provided, however, that if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 8, the Company shall remain
obligated to reimburse the non-breaching Buyers for the expenses described in
Section 4(g) above.
     
    9.           MISCELLANEOUS.
     
    (a)           Governing Law; Jurisdiction;
Jury Trial.  All questions concerning the construction,
validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by
the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdictions other than the State of New York.  Each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts sitting in The City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the
adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any
transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that
such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper.  Each party
hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process
being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to
such party at the address for such notices to it under this Agreement and agrees
that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and
notice thereof.  The Company hereby appoints C T Corporation System,
with offices at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its agent for
service of process in New York.  Nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by
law.  EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A
JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.
     
    (b)           Counterparts.  This
Agreement may be executed in two or more identical counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party. In
the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by an
e-mail which contains a portable document format (.pdf) file of an executed
signature page, such signature page shall be considered due execution and shall
be binding upon the signatory thereto with the same force and effect as if the
signature were an original.
     
    (c)           Headings.  The
headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference and shall not form
part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Agreement.

     (d)          Severability.  If
any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to
be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision
that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed
amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable,
and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement so long as this Agreement
as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original
intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited
nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not
substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of
the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be
conferred upon the parties.  The parties will endeavor in good faith
negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s)
with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to
that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s).
     
    (e)            Entire Agreement;
Amendments.  This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
supersede all other prior oral or written agreements between the Buyers, the
Company, their affiliates and Persons acting on their behalf with respect to the
matters discussed herein, and this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
and the instruments referenced herein and therein contain the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the matters covered herein and
therein and, except as specifically set forth herein or therein, neither the
Company nor any Buyer makes any representation, warranty, covenant or
undertaking with respect to such matters.  No provision of this
Agreement may be amended other than by an instrument in writing signed by the
Company and the Required Holders, and any amendment to this Agreement made in
conformity with the provisions of this Section 9(e) shall be binding on all
Buyers and holders of Securities, as applicable.  No provision hereof
may be waived other than by an instrument in writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought.  No such amendment shall be effective to
the extent that it applies to less than all of the holders of the applicable
Securities then outstanding.  No consideration shall be offered or
paid to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any
provision of any of the Transaction Documents unless the same consideration also
is offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents, holders of Shares
or holders of the Warrants, as the case may be.  The Company has not,
directly or indirectly, made any agreements with any Buyers relating to the
terms or conditions of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents except as set forth in the Transaction Documents.  Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company confirms that, except as set forth in this
Agreement, no Buyer has made any commitment or promise or has any other
obligation to provide any financing to the Company or otherwise.
     
    (f)            Notices.  Any
notices, consents, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be
given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to
have been delivered:  (i) upon receipt, when delivered personally;
(ii) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile (provided confirmation of transmission
is mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending
party); or (iii) one Business Day after deposit with an overnight courier
service, in each case properly addressed to the party to receive the
same.  The addresses and facsimile numbers for such communications

    Any
document shall be deemed to have been duly served if marked for the attention of
the agent for service of process at its address (as set forth in Section 9(a))
or such other address in the United States as may be notified to the party
wishing to serve the document and delivered in accordance with the notice
provisions set forth in this Section 9(f).
    
    If the
Company's agent for service of process at any time ceases for any reason to act
as such, the Company shall appoint a replacement agent having an address for
service in the United States and shall notify each Buyer in writing of the name
and address of the replacement agent.  Failing such appointment and
notification, each Buyer shall be entitled by notice to the Company to appoint a
replacement agent to act on the Company's behalf.  The provisions of
this Section 9(f) applying to service on an agent for service of process apply
equally to service on a replacement agent.
     
    (g)           Successors and
Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, including
any purchasers of the Shares or the Warrants.  The Company shall not
assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Required Holders, including by way of a Fundamental
Transaction (unless the Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions
governing Fundamental Transactions set forth in the Warrants).  A
Buyer may assign some or all of its rights hereunder without the consent of the
Company, in which event such assignee shall be deemed to be a Buyer hereunder
with respect to such assigned rights.
     
    (h)           No Third Party
Beneficiaries.  This Agreement is intended for the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and is
not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other
Person, except that (i) the Placement Agent is an
intended third party beneficiary of the Company's representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3 hereof, and (ii) the Placement Agent shall be an
addressee of the legal opinions identified in Section 7(ii)
hereof.
     
    (i)             Survival.  Unless
this Agreement is terminated under Section 8, the representations and warranties
of the Company and the Buyers contained in Sections 2 and 3, and the agreements
and covenants set forth in Sections 4, 5 and 9 shall survive the
Closing.  Each Buyer shall be responsible only for its own
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants hereunder.
     
    (j)             Further
Assurances.  Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be
done and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and
deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as
any other party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

    (k)            Indemnification.  In
consideration of each Buyer's execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents and acquiring the Securities thereunder and in addition to all of the
Company's other obligations under the Transaction Documents, the Company shall
defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer and each other holder of
the Securities and all of their shareholders, partners, members, officers,
directors, employees and direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing
Persons' agents or other representatives (including, without limitation, those
retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against
any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, losses, costs, penalties,
fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in connection therewith
(irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to the action for which
indemnification hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements (the "Indemnified Liabilities"),
incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to (a)
any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in the Transaction Documents, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement
or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or (c) any
cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee by a
third party (including for these purposes a derivative action brought on behalf
of the Company) and arising out of or resulting from (i) the execution,
delivery, performance or enforcement of the Transaction Documents, (ii) any
transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, with the proceeds of the issuance of the Securities, (iii) any
disclosure made by such Buyer pursuant to Section 4(i), or (iv) the status of
such Buyer or holder of the Securities as an investor in the Company pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, provided, however,
that the Company's obligations under this Section 9(k) with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities referred to in the preceding clauses (a) through (c) and
incurred under the Registration Rights Agreement shall be limited to the
Indemnified Liabilities for which indemnity is expressly provided pursuant to
Section 6 of the Registration Rights Agreement.  To the extent that
the foregoing undertaking by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason,
the Company shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction
of each of the Indemnified Liabilities that is permissible under applicable
law.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, the mechanics and
procedures with respect to the rights and obligations under this Section 9(k)
shall be the same as those set forth in Section 6 of the Registration Rights
Agreement.
     
    (l)             No Strict
Construction.  The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent,
and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any
party.
     
    (m)           Remedies.  Each
Buyer and each holder of the Securities shall have all rights and remedies set
forth in the Transaction Documents and all rights and remedies which such
holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and
all of the rights which such holders have under any law.  Any Person
having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to
enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to
recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and
to exercise all other rights granted by law.  Furthermore, the Company
recognizes that in the event that it fails to perform, observe, or discharge any
or all of its obligations under the Transaction Documents, any remedy at law may
prove to be inadequate relief to the Buyers.  The Company therefore
agrees that the Buyers shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent
injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual
damages and without posting a bond or other security.

    (n)           Rescission and Withdrawal
Right.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
(and without limiting any similar provisions of) the Transaction Documents,
whenever any Buyer exercises a right, election, demand or option under a
Transaction Document and the Company does not timely perform its related
obligations within the periods therein provided, then such Buyer may rescind or
withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to the
Company, any relevant notice, demand or election in whole or in part without
prejudice to its future actions and rights.
     
    (o)           Payment Set
Aside.  To the extent that the Company makes a payment or
payments to the Buyers hereunder or pursuant to any of the other Transaction
Documents or the Buyers enforce or exercise their rights hereunder or
thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or
exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are
required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee,
receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any
bankruptcy law, foreign, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of
action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement
or setoff had not occurred.
     
    (p)           Independent Nature of
Buyers' Obligations and Rights.  The obligations of each Buyer
under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of
any other Buyer, and no Buyer shall be responsible in any way for the
performance of the obligations of any other Buyer under any Transaction
Document.  Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction
Document, and no action taken by any Buyer pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be
deemed to constitute the Buyers as, and the Company acknowledges that the Buyers
do not so constitute, a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Buyers are in any way
acting in concert or as a group, and the Company shall not assert any such claim
with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and the Company acknowledges that the Buyers are not
acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.  The Company
acknowledges and each Buyer confirms that it has independently participated in
the negotiation of the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its
own counsel and advisors.  Each Buyer shall be entitled to
independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the
rights arising out of this Agreement or out of any other Transaction Documents,
and it shall not be necessary for any other Buyer to be joined as an additional
party in any proceeding for such purpose.
     
    (q)            
     Currency.  Unless
otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts referred to in this Agreement are in
United States Dollars.  All amounts owing under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document shall be paid in US dollars.  All amounts
denominated in other currencies shall be converted in the US dollar equivalent
amount in accordance with the Exchange Rate on the date of
calculation.  "Exchange Rate" means, in
relation to any amount of currency to be converted into US dollars pursuant to
this Agreement, the US dollar exchange rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal on the relevant date of calculation.

    (r)       
           Judgment
Currency.
     
    (i)                      
If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Company in any
court in any jurisdiction it becomes necessary to convert into any other
currency (such other currency being hereinafter in this Section 9(r) referred to
as the "Judgment
Currency") an amount due in US Dollars under this Agreement, the
conversion shall be made at the Exchange Rate prevailing on the Business Day
immediately preceding:
     
    (1)     
the date of actual payment of the amount due, in the case of any proceeding in
the courts of New York or in the courts of any other jurisdiction that will give
effect to such conversion being made on such date: or
     
    (2)     
the date on which the foreign court determines, in the case of any proceeding in
the courts of any other jurisdiction (the date as of which such conversion is
made pursuant to this Section being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Conversion
Date").
     
    (ii)                      If
in the case of any proceeding in the court of any jurisdiction referred to in
Section 9(r)(i)(2) above, there is a change in the Exchange Rate prevailing
between the Judgment Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the
amount due, the applicable party shall pay such adjusted amount as may be
necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the Exchange Rate prevailing on the date of payment, will produce
the amount of US Dollars which could have been purchased with the amount of
Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial order at the Exchange
Rate prevailing on the Judgment Conversion Date.
     
    (iii)                      Any
amount due from the Company under this provision shall be due as a separate debt
and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other amounts due
under or in respect of this Agreement.
