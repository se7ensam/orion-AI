calcineurin inhibitor being developed for use in the prevention of organ rejection following transplantation and the treatment of autoimmune diseases. 3SBio made an up-front license payment of US$1.5 million in addition to a US$4.5 million
investment in a note convertible into Isotechnika’s common shares. As of September 30, 2010, 3SBio converted US$1.9 million notes into 13 million common shares.

 China’s State Food and Drug Administration inspected the new plant and granted GMP certification in August 2010. 
Dr. Jing Lou, chief executive officer of 3SBio, commented:  “We continue to seek opportunities to introduce innovative products with substantial unmet medical need in the China market. Isotechnika’s voclosporin, a phase II immunosuppressant targeted for
use in organ transplant therapy will address the needs of the estimated 10,000 new transplant recipients in China each year, as well as the approximately 100,000 patients who have already benefited from an organ transplant. Based on the phase II
results, voclosporin has fewer side effects, including the risk of developing diabetes, a significant advantage over other products in its class. This strategic partnership also reinforces our goal of establishing 3SBio as the partner of choice in
China for biopharmaceutical companies around the world. We are also pleased to announce that EPIAO production has commenced at our new plant in Shenyang which will better enable us to satisfy the growing demand in China as well as explore
international biosimilar opportunities.”  Three months ended September 30, 2010 Unaudited Financial Results 
Net revenues. Net revenues increased by 24.9% to RMB115.6 million (US$17.3 million) for the third quarter of 2010 from RMB 92.6 million
(US$13.6 million) for the same period in 2009. This increase was largely due to continued strength from EPIAO and TPIAO products which increased by 22.6% and 28.2%, respectively, over the same period in 2009. TPIAO remained the Company’s second
largest revenue contributor in the quarter, accounting for 30.9% of total net revenues. Export sales increased by 49.3% to RMB3.4 million (US$0.5 million), and revenues from our IV Iron Sucrose supplement rose 28.7% to RMB4.8 million (US$0.7
million).  Gross profit. As a result of continued sales growth from key products, gross profit for the third quarter of
2010 increased by 21.0% to RMB103.6 million (US$15.5 million) from RMB85.6 (US$12.5 million) for the same period in 2009. Gross margin decreased by 3.1% to 89.6% for the third quarter of 2010 from 92.5% for the same period in 2009. The decrease in
gross margin is mainly due to higher depreciation charges attributable to the new production facilities in Shenyang.  Operating
expenses. Operating expenses were RMB76.8 million (US$11.5 million) for the third quarter of 2010, or 66.5% of net revenues, compared to operating expenses of RMB57.1 million (US$8.4 million), or 61.7% of net revenue for the same
period in 2009. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues was largely driven by higher R&D expenses.   


 
•
 
 Research and development (“R&D”) costs. R&D costs for the third quarter of 2010 were RMB11.8 million (US$1.8 million), or
10.2% of net revenues, compared to RMB7.6 million (US$1.1 million), or 8.2% of net revenues for the same period in 2009. RMB17 million (US$2.5 million) prepayment of R&D expense has been made to Ascentage Pharma as of Q3 2010, of which RMB4.8

million), or 45.4% of net revenues, compared to RMB41.1 million (US$6.0 million), or 44.4% of net revenue, for the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales activities in general and continued investment in
building the TPIAO and EPIAO brands.

RMB2.5 million (US$0.4 million) for the same period in 2009.  Net income. Net income was RMB22.4 million (US$3.4 million) for
