portions, if any of the Adjustment Holdback and (if applicable) the Appraisal

      2.8 Dissenting
Shares; Release of Appraisal Holdback.
       
      (a) If,
following the Closing, there are any Remaining Shares not acquired by Purchaser
as of the Closing then, subsequent to the Closing and the consummation of the
Merger contemplated by  Section 
 6.19, all
Dissenting Shares will be converted into the right to receive such consideration
as may be determined to be due to the Dissenting Stockholder holding such
Dissenting Shares under Delaware General Corporation Law and the California
General Corporation Law, as applicable.  If a Dissenting Stockholder
forfeits his, her or its right to appraisal under the Delaware General
Corporation Law and the California General Corporation Law, as applicable, or
properly withdraws his, her or its demand for appraisal of Dissenting Shares,
then, as of the occurrence of such event, such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive the consideration payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to
Section 
 6.19.
       
      (b) The
Company shall give the Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and (ii)

California General Corporation Law, as applicable.  The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser or as required by
applicable Law, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of
Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
       
      (c) (i) The
costs of conducting any appraisal proceedings (including any reasonable fees of
attorney and advisors) as well as (ii) any amounts paid to any Dissenting
Stockholder on account of such Dissenting Stockholder’s assertion of appraisal
rights, shall be
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15

      paid by
Purchaser from (or, if paid by the Company, shall be deemed to reduce) the
Appraisal Holdback (and, to the extent that the Appraisal Holdback is
insufficient first by the Sellers’ Representatives on behalf of the Sellers from
the Representative Account and, if still insufficient, from the Escrow
Account).
       
      (d) Within
five (5) Business Days following such time as (i) all Dissenting
Stockholders have either been paid, pursuant to applicable Law for their
Dissenting Shares or have ceased to be Dissenting Shareholders and been paid for
their Shares in accordance with Section 
 6.19, and
(ii) Purchaser owns one-hundred percent (100%) of the Company Securities,
Purchaser shall release the remaining balance, if any, of the Appraisal Holdback
to the Paying Agent (to be allocated among the Sellers and the Non-Exercising
Optionholders in accordance with Exhibit B
hereto).
       
      2.9 Net Working Capital
Adjustment.
       
      (a) Closing Date Purchase Price
Adjustment.
       
      (i) Not later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Purchaser with an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company as
of immediately after the Closing (the “Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet”) and a statement of the estimated Closing Working Capital (as
defined in Section 
 2.9(b)(i) below),
derived from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (“Estimated Closing Working
Capital”).  The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated
Closing Working Capital shall be prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP
applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and
procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and
estimation and accrual methodologies that were used in the preparation of the
Company’s audited Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end, as
if such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Working Capital
were being prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end.
       
      (ii) If
Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than Target Working Capital, then the
Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be decreased by the positive
difference between Estimated Closing Working Capital and Target Working Capital
(the “Estimated
Closing Working Capital Shortfall”).  If Estimated Closing
Working Capital is greater than Target Working Capital, then the Base Purchase
Price payable at Closing will be increased by the positive difference between
Estimated Closing Working Capital and Target Working Capital (the “Estimated Closing Working
Capital Excess”).  “Target Working
Capital” shall be $1,000,000.
       
      (b) Post-Closing Date Purchase
Price Adjustment.
       
      (i) Following
the Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided herein to
reflect the difference between Closing Working Capital and Estimated Closing
Working Capital.  “Closing Working
Capital” means the Net Working Capital of the Company as of immediately
after the Closing, provided, however, that if, as
of the Closing Date, one or more of the individuals listed on Schedule 
 6.26 has not
executed a Parachute Payment Waiver as provided in Section 
 6.26(a), the Company shall
include in its calculation of Closing

      Net
Working Capital, a deemed liability equal to the portion of the value of the tax
deductions lost pursuant to Section 280G of the Code which result from the
acceleration of vesting for Company Options and Accelerated Shares and shall
reduce the Company’s Net Working Capital on a dollar by dollar basis to reflect
the loss of such Tax deductions (the “280G
Deduction”).  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value
of the acceleration of the Company Options and Accelerated Shares shall be
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1, Q&A-12 and
Q&A-13.  The value of the lost Tax deduction shall deemed to be
equal to (A) the dollar amount of the Tax deduction the Company could have
as a result the acceleration of vesting for Company Options and Accelerated
Shares had Parachute Payment Waivers been exercised, multiplied by
(B) 39.5%.
       
      (ii) Within 45
days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers’
Representatives a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of immediately
after the Closing (the “Closing Balance
Sheet”) audited by the Company’s accountants and a statement of Closing
Working Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet (the “Closing Working Capital
Statement”).  The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working
Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the
same accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and valuation, estimation and accrual
methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Company’s audited
Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end, as if such Closing
Balance Sheet was as of a fiscal year end.
       
      (iii) The
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement (and the
computation of Closing Working Capital indicated thereon) delivered by Purchaser
to the Sellers’ Representatives shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
unless the Sellers’ Representatives, within 15 days after delivery to the
Sellers’ Representatives of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working
Capital Statement, notifies Purchaser in writing that the Sellers’
Representatives disputes any of the amounts set forth therein, specifying the
nature of the dispute and the basis therefor. 
The parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any dispute and, if the
parties so resolve all disputes, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Working Capital Statement (and the computation of Closing Working Capital
indicated thereon), as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution
of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties.  If
the parties do not reach agreement in resolving the dispute within 15 days after
notice is given by the Sellers’ Representatives to Purchaser pursuant to the
second preceding sentence, the parties shall submit the dispute to the
accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, LLP, or, if such firm will not act, to
such other “big four” accounting firm which is mutually agreeable to the parties
(the “Arbiter”)
for resolution.  Promptly, but no later than 20 days after acceptance
of its appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter shall determine (it being understood
that in making such determination, the Arbiter shall be functioning as an expert
and not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by Purchaser and
the Sellers’ Representatives, and not by independent review, only those issues
in dispute and shall render a written report as to the resolution of the dispute
and the resulting computation of the Closing Working Capital which shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. 
All proceedings conducted by the Arbiter shall take place in Orange County,
California.  In resolving any disputed item, the Arbiter
(x) shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 
 2.9 and
(y) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such items claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
items claimed by either party.  The fees, costs and

      expenses
of the Arbiter shall be allocated to and borne by Purchaser and the Sellers
based on the inverse of the percentage that the Arbiter’s determination (before
such allocation) bears to the total items in dispute as originally submitted to
the Arbiter with the Sellers’ portion paid first from the Adjustment Holdback
and, if needed, by the Sellers’ Representatives from the Representative Account
and, if needed, from the Escrow Account.  By way of example and not of
limitation, if Purchaser and Sellers’ Representatives have a dispute over $100
and the Arbiter awards $60 to Sellers (60% of the amount in dispute) and $40 to
Purchaser (40% of the amount in dispute), Purchaser would bear 60% of the fees,
costs and expenses of the Arbiter and Sellers would bear 40% of the fees, costs
and expenses of the Arbiter.
       
      (iv) Upon
final determination of Closing Working Capital as provided in Section 
 2.9(b)(iii)
above, (A) if Closing Working Capital is greater than Estimated Closing
Working Capital, the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by the excess of
Closing Working Capital over Estimated Closing Working Capital and Purchaser
shall promptly, but no later than five (5) Business Days after such final
determination, pay the amount of such difference, together with interest thereon
from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof, to the Paying Agent to be
allocated among the Sellers and the Non-Exercising Optionholders in accordance
with Exhibit B
hereto, and (B) if Closing Working Capital is less than Estimated Closing
Working Capital, the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by the excess of

if any, shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Paying Agent, to be allocated

hereto, not later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet is
determined final.  If the Adjustment Holdback is insufficient to
satisfy any amount due to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 
 2.9(b)(iv) above,
such excess amount will be paid by the Sellers’ Representatives on behalf of the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall not be required to demand such payment from the
Escrow Account.
       
      (vi) For the
purposes of this Section

      2.10 Earnout Payments.
       
      (a) No later
than 90 days after the last day of each Earnout Year, the Purchaser will provide
notice to the Sellers’ Representatives (the “Earnout Notice”) of
the actual Deemed Net Revenue for the relevant Earnout Year.
       
      (b) Subject
to subsections (f), (g) and (j) through (m) of this Section 
 2.10, for each of
the Earnout Years ending December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2013 (each such Earnout Year, a “Base Earnout Year”)
in which Deemed Net Revenue meets or exceeds Target Net Revenue for such Earnout
Year, Purchaser shall pay to Paying Agent (for

      distribution
to Sellers in accordance with Exhibit B
hereto) $25,000,000 (each such $25,000,000 payment, a “Base Earnout
Payment”).  The parties acknowledge and agree that to the
extent that Deemed Net Revenue is less than Target Net Revenue for any Base
Earnout Year (i) no Earnout shall be payable by Purchaser for such Base
Earnout Year and (ii) Deemed Net Revenue for such Base Earnout Year shall
not be carried forward to any subsequent Earnout Year for purposes of
determining whether Target Net Revenue for such subsequent Earnout Year is met
or exceeded (nor for any other purpose).
       
      (c) Subject
to subsections (g) and (j) through (m) of this Section 
 2.10, for each
Earnout Year in which Deemed Net Revenue exceeds Target Net Revenue for such
Earnout Year, Purchaser shall pay to Paying Agent (for distribution to Sellers
in accordance with Exhibit B
hereto) an amount equal to the amount by which the Deemed Net Revenue for such
Earnout Year exceeds the Target Net Revenue for such Earnout Year, multiplied by
0.5 (each such payment, an “Excess Earnout
Payment”).
       
      (d) In the
event that due to external conditions (whether or not market related)
Purchaser’s actual selling price for the Product during any Earnout Year (based
on unbundled, arms’-length sales to un-Affiliated third parties) is lower, by
ten percent (10%) or more, than the applicable Deemed Product Price for such
Earnout Year (the percentage by which the actual Product price is lower than the
Deemed Product Price, the “Product Reduction
Percentage”):
       
      (i) the
parties shall adjust the Deemed Product Price for (A) such Earnout Year and

      (iii) the
parties shall recalculate Target Net Revenue for (A) such Earnout Year and
(B) for each subsequent Earnout Year (as set forth on Annex 1 hereto)
by adding (X) Target Procedure Revenue for each such Earnout Year (as
adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to Section 
 2.10
 (e)(ii) below) to
(Y) Target Product Revenue for each such Earnout Year, as adjusted pursuant
to Section 
 2.10(d)(ii)
above.
       
      Purchaser
may not adjust the Deemed Product Price and Target Product Revenue pursuant to
this Section 
 2.10(d) more than
once per Earnout Year.
       
      (e) In the
event that due to external conditions (whether or not market related) the actual
amount charged by Purchaser for each Procedure performed during any Earnout Year
(utilizing Products sold in unbundled, arms’-length sales to un-Affiliated third
parties) is lower, by ten percent (10%) or more, than the applicable Deemed
Procedure Price for such Earnout Year (the percentage by which the actual
Procedure charge is lower than the Deemed Procedure Price, the “Procedure Reduction
Percentage”):
       
      (i) the
parties shall adjust the Deemed Procedure Price for (A) such Earnout Year
and (B) for each subsequent Earnout Year (as set forth on Annex 1 hereto),
by a percentage amount equal to Procedure Reduction Percentage;

      (ii) the
parties shall adjust the Target Procedure Revenue for (A) such Earnout Year
and (B) for each subsequent Earnout Year (as set forth on Annex 1 hereto)
by a percentage amount equal to the Procedure Reduction Percentage;
and
       
      (iii) the
parties shall recalculate Target Net Revenue for (A) such Earnout Year and
(B) for each subsequent Earnout Year (as set forth on Annex 1 hereto)
by adding (X) Target Product Revenue for each such Earnout Year (as
adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to Section 
 2.10(d)(ii)
above) to (Y) Target Procedure Revenue for each such Earnout Year, as
adjusted pursuant to Section 
 2.10(e)(ii)
above.
       
      Purchaser
may not adjust the Deemed Procedure Price and Target Procedure Revenue pursuant
to this Section 
 2.10(e) more than
once per Earnout Year.
       
      (f) Notwithstanding
Section 
 2.10(b), no Base
Earnout Payment shall be owed by Purchaser for the Base Earnout Years ending
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 unless on or before
January 1, 2012 (with respect to the Base Earnout Year ending

Earnout Payments (Base Earnout Payment or Excess Earnout Payments) shall be owed
by Purchaser:
       
      (i) for the
Earnout Year ending December 31, 2013 unless (A) on or before
January 1, 2013, the FDA has granted a 510(k) Clearance or (B) on or
before July 1, 2013, the FDA has granted an Investigational Device exemption, in
each case, for the use of the Company Femtosecond Laser in astigmatic

the Company Femtosecond Laser in astigmatic keratotomy.
       
      (h) The
Earnout Notice delivered by Purchaser to the Sellers’ Representatives shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties unless the Sellers’ Representatives,
within twenty (20) days after delivery to the Sellers’ Representatives of the
Earnout Notice, notifies Purchaser in writing that the Sellers’ Representatives
disputes any of the amounts set forth therein or whether the Diligent Efforts
required pursuant to Section 
 2.10
 (n) have been
made, specifying the nature of the dispute and the basis therefor. 
The parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any dispute and, if the
parties so resolve all disputes, the Earnout Notice, as amended to the extent
necessary to reflect the resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties.  If the parties do not reach agreement in
resolving the dispute within twenty (20) days after notice is given by the
Sellers’ Representatives to Purchaser pursuant to the second

      preceding
sentence, the parties shall submit the dispute to the Arbiter for
resolution.  Promptly, but no later than twenty (20) days after
acceptance of its appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter shall determine (it being
understood that in making such determination, the Arbiter shall be functioning
as an expert and not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by
Purchaser and the Sellers’ Representatives, and not by independent review, only
those issues in dispute and shall render a written report as to the resolution
of the dispute and the resulting computation of the Earnout Payment which shall
be conclusive and binding on the parties.

Arbiter shall be allocated to and borne by Purchaser and the Sellers based on
the inverse of the percentage that the Arbiter’s determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Arbiter (as such methodology is more fully described in the final sentence of
Section 
 2.9(b)(iii)) with
the Sellers’ portion paid first by offset from one or more Earnout Payments
(without being required to offset or deduct such amount from any Escrowed
Earnout Amount) and, if needed, by the Sellers’ Representatives from the
Representative Account and, if needed, from the Escrow Account.
       
      (i) Subject

 2.10, upon final

December 31 of 2011, 2012 and 2013, Purchaser shall pay only seventy-five
percent (75%) of the amount of such Earnout Payment to the Paying Agent (to be

Payment to the Escrow Agent (any such amount, an “Escrowed Earnout
Amount”), to be deposited into the Escrow Account.
       
      (k) Any
amount to be paid to the Paying Agent (to be allocated among the Sellers in
accordance with Exhibit B
hereto), whether one-hundred percent (100%) or seventy-five percent (75%) of any
Earnout Payment, as applicable, shall be subject to offset as provided in Sections 
 8.6(a)(ii) and 
8.7(a)(ii)
hereof.
       
      (l) The
amount of all Earnout Payments shall be proportionately reduced to account for
the percentage of the Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) that were acquired
by the Purchaser in the Merger.
       
      (m) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Earnout Payments shall not exceed $382,500,000 in the
aggregate (the “Earnout
Cap”).
       
      (n) Diligent
Efforts.  Purchaser shall use Diligent Efforts to maximize
Deemed Net Revenue during the Earnout Years.

the foregoing provisions of this

other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payments due hereunder any amounts it is required by Law to
deduct and withhold in respect of making such payments under any provision of
the Code, or any state, local or foreign Tax law withholding tax at the maximum
rate for such withholding, unless the Purchaser is provided, at least five (5)
Business Days before such payment is made, with an exemption from such
withholding tax or reduced rate of withholding certificate in respect of such
payment for each Seller for the Purchaser’s full satisfaction.  If the
Purchaser so withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Sellers.

Legal Proceeding is resolved in a manner which does not require Purchaser to
make any FTO Payments, the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release
the Escrow Balance to the Paying Agent (to be allocated among the Sellers in
accordance with Exhibit B
hereto), except to the extent otherwise required to be retained pursuant to
subsections

shall remain in the Escrow Account until released in accordance with Section 
 2.12
 (f)) and the
parties shall

Purchaser) upon the resolution of such Unresolved Claims in accordance with 
ARTICLE VIII and
the terms of the Escrow Agreement but only to the extent not otherwise required

      6.2 Additional Seller
Covenants.  From and after the signing of this Agreement (or,
with respect to any Joining Seller, such later time as such Joining Seller
executes a counterpart signature page) and until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, the Sellers covenant and agree with the Purchaser
that:
       
      (a) None of
the Sellers shall dispose of any interest in the Company Securities or any of
them or grant any option over or create or allow to exist any Lien over the
Company Securities or any of them.
       
      (b) The
Sellers shall not vote in favor of any shareholders’ resolution without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser.
       
      6.3 Access to Information;
Confidentiality.  The Company shall, and the Sellers shall
cause the Company to, afford to Purchaser and its accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives, and to prospective lenders,
placement agents and other financing sources and each of their respective
representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours upon reasonable
notice throughout the period prior to the Closing, to the Company’s properties
and facilities (including all owned or leased real property and the buildings,
structures, fixtures, appurtenances and improvements erected, attached or
located thereon), books, financial information (including working papers and
data in the possession of the Company or their respective independent public
accountants, internal audit reports, and “management letters” from such
accountants with respect to the Company’s systems of internal controls),
Contracts and records of the Company and, during such period, shall furnish
promptly such information concerning the businesses, properties and personnel of
the Company as Purchaser shall reasonably request; provided, however, such
investigation shall not unreasonably disrupt the Company’s
operations.  Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall generally keep
Purchaser informed as to all material matters involving the operations and
businesses of the Company.  All nonpublic information provided to, or
obtained by, Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be “Confidential
Information” for purposes of the Confidential Mutual Disclosure Agreement
dated May 30, 2009, as amended on April 28, 2010 among Purchaser and the
Company (the “Confidentiality
Agreement”), the terms of which shall continue in force until the
Closing; provided that Purchaser and the Company may disclose such information
as may be necessary in connection with seeking necessary consents and approvals
as
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          48
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      contemplated
hereby.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to disclose any information if such disclosure would contravene any
applicable Law, violate, in any material respect, a contractual obligation to
any third party or potentially constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
privilege.  No information provided to or obtained by Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 
 6.3 shall limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Purchaser (including
Purchaser’s right to seek indemnification pursuant to 
ARTICLE VIII), or
the representations or warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of,
the parties hereto.
       
      6.4 Third Party
Consents.  The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable date all consents, waivers and
approvals from, and provide all notices to, all Persons that are not a
Governmental Authority, which consents, waivers, approvals and notices are
required to consummate, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the consents, waivers, approvals and notices referred
to in Section 
 4.3
hereof.  All such consents, waivers, approvals and notices shall be in
writing and in form and substance reasonable satisfactory to Purchaser, and
executed counterparts of any such consents, waivers and approvals shall be
delivered to Purchaser promptly after receipt thereof, and copies of any such
notices shall be delivered to Purchaser promptly after the making
thereof.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay any amounts
in connection with obtaining any consent, waiver or approval.
       
      6.5 Governmental Consents and
Approvals.
       
      (a) Each of
Purchaser and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain at the earliest practical date all consents, waivers, approvals, Orders,
Permits, authorizations and declarations  from, make all filings with,
and provide all notices to, all Governmental Authorities which are required to
consummate, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consents, waivers, approvals, Orders, Permits,
authorizations, declarations, filings and notices referred to in Sections 
 3.3(b) and 
4.3(b).  Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and the Company shall (i) make all
filings required of either of them or either of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event,
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement in the case of
all filings required under the HSR Act and within four (4) weeks in the case of
all other filings required by other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials received by each
of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”)
or any other Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or such
transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any
such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Authority under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction and shall enter into a joint defense agreement to govern such
cooperation.  Each such party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish to each other party hereto all information required for
any
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          49
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      application
or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the other Transaction
Documents.  Each such party shall promptly inform the other parties
hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or
any such transaction and permit the other parties to review in advance any
proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority.  No party hereto shall independently participate in any
formal or informal meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties
hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate.  Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto shall
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with the matters described
in this Section 
 6.5, including in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party
hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws.
       
      (b) Each of
Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Law,
including the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the “Antitrust
Laws”).  Each of Purchaser and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of
this sentence shall include the Company) shall be required, in connection with
the matters covered by this Section 
 6.5, (i) to
pay any amounts (other than as set forth in Section 
 6.5
 (f)),
(ii) to commence or defend any litigation, (iii) to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of their respective businesses,
product lines or assets, (iv) to agree to any limitation on the operation
or conduct of their or the Company’s respective businesses, assets or operation
or (v) to waive any of the conditions set forth in 
ARTICLE VII of
this Agreement.
       
      (c) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser will have the sole and exclusive
right to determine whether to take any actions in connection with any demands
for sale, divestiture or disposition of assets or business of Purchaser or,
effective as of the Closing, the Company, asserted by the Antitrust Division or
the FTC in connection with antitrust matters or to defend through litigation any
proceeding commenced by the Antitrust Division or the FTC in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Documents; any such
determination by Purchaser shall not effect any party’s right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to 
ARTICLE VII so
long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 
 6.5.  Purchaser
shall have the sole and exclusive right to direct and control any such
litigation, negotiation or other action, with counsel of its own
choosing.
       
      (d) If any
Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and by the other
Transaction
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          50
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      Documents
as in violation of any Law, the Company shall, at Purchaser’s request, use
commercially reasonable efforts, and Purchaser shall cooperate with the Company,
to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and by the other Transaction Documents, including by pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.
       
      (e) The
Company will cooperate in taking any action required to be taken by any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
that is within its control and that Purchaser reasonably requests the Company to
take so long as the effectiveness of such action is conditioned on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the Company
shall not be required to take any actions that, individually or in the
aggregate, would in the reasonable judgment of the Company result in a negative
impact on the business of the Company if the transactions contemplated hereby
are not consummated.
       
      (f) All fees
required to be paid in connection with filings required under the HSR
Act  in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid fifty-percent (50%) by the Company and fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser.  All out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Purchaser or
the Company in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to this
Section 
 6.5 shall be
borne by the party incurring such expenses.
       
      (g) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, successors and assigns that the operation of the
Company’s business shall remain in the dominion and control of the Company until
the Closing and that none of the foregoing Persons will provide, directly or
indirectly, any directions, orders, advice, aid, assistance or information to
any director, officer or employee of the Company except as specifically
contemplated or permitted by this Section 
 6.5 and not
otherwise in violation of Law.
       
      6.6 Further
Assurances.  Each of the Company and Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable
date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
       
      6.7 Non-Competition.
       
      (a) Each
Restricted Seller acknowledges and agrees that such Restricted Seller has
technical and other expertise associated with the business of the Company
including the Restricted Business.  In addition, each Restricted
Seller has valuable business contacts with clients and potential clients of the
Company.  Furthermore, each Restricted Seller’s reputation and
goodwill are an integral part of the Company’s success throughout the areas
where it conducts business.  If a Restricted Seller deprives Purchaser
of the Restricted Seller’s goodwill or in any manner uses his or her reputation
and goodwill in competition with Purchaser in contravention of this Agreement,
Purchaser will be deprived of the benefits it has bargained for
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          51
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      pursuant
to this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.  But for the
Restricted Sellers’ entry into the covenants contemplated by this Section 
 6.7, Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement with the Restricted
Sellers.  Each Restricted Seller, in exchange for the consideration to
be paid pursuant hereto, is willing to enter into the covenants contemplated by
this Section 
 6.7.
       
      (b) Unless
otherwise agreed in writing by Purchaser, for a period of two (2) years from and
after the Closing Date, except to work with and for the Company or the
Purchaser, each Restricted Seller shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, engage in, operate, control, work
for, consult with, render services for, do business with, maintain any interest
in (proprietary, financial or otherwise) or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the Restricted
Business; provided, however, that the restrictions contained in this Section 
 6.7 shall not
restrict (i) the acquisition by the Restricted Sellers, directly or
indirectly, of less than 2% of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly
traded company engaged in a Restricted Business or (ii) a Restricted
Sellers’ employment by a Person engaged in the Restricted Business to the extent
that such Restricted Seller is employed by a division of such Person which is
not engaged in the Restricted Business.  Each Restricted Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the business of the Company is worldwide and that,
accordingly the foregoing restriction shall apply on a worldwide
basis.
       
      (c) Each
Restricted Seller acknowledges that the restrictions, prohibitions and other
provisions hereof are reasonable, fair and equitable in scope, terms and
duration, are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of
Purchaser, and are a material inducement to Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and Purchaser is relying on
the terms of this Section 
 6.7 in doing
so.
       
      (d) All of
the parties agree that the duration and area for which the covenant not to
compete set forth in this Section 
 6.7 is to be
effective have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated parties and
specifically hereby agree that such duration and area are reasonable under the
circumstances.  The parties hereto agree that, if any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that a specified time period, a specified
geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant feature
of this Section 
 6.7 is
unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then this Section 
 6.7 shall be
deemed a covenant for such lesser period of time, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by such court to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy and such covenant as
modified shall remain in full force and effect and may be enforced against the
applicable party.  The parties intend that this covenant shall be
deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each and every county of
each and every state of the United States of America and for any other country
in the world where this covenant is intended to be
effective.  Additionally, the parties intend that this covenant shall
be deemed to be a series of separate covenants for each Restricted Seller and
that the invalidity of any portion of this Section 
 6.7 as to any
Restricted Seller shall not effect the validity of such covenants as to any
other Restricted Seller.
       
      (e) The
covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 
 6.7 relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this Section 
 6.7 will cause
irreparable injury to Purchaser, the amount of which will be
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          52
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      impossible
to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated.  Accordingly, the remedy at Law for any breach of this
Section 
 6.7 will be
inadequate.  Therefore, Purchaser will be entitled to a temporary and
permanent injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 
 6.7 without the
necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond
whatsoever.  The rights and remedies provided by this Section 
 6.7 are cumulative
and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have
hereunder.
       
      (f) The
covenants set forth in this Section 
 6.7 are intended
to function as an agreement separate from the remainder of this Agreement and
the invalidity of any portion of this Section 
 6.7 shall not
affect the continued validity of any other portion of this
Agreement.
       
      (g) In the
event that Purchaser were to seek damages for any breach of this Section 
 6.7, the
Non-Competition Payments delivered to the Sellers hereunder which are allocated
by the parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a measure of or
limit on such damages.
       
      6.8 Non-Solicitation;
Confidentiality.
       
      (a) Unless
otherwise agreed in writing by Purchaser, for a period of two (2) years from and
after the Closing Date, each Restricted-Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including Affiliates who are Sellers) not to, directly or indirectly
cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees of the Company to leave such
employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual unless such
employee of the Company was terminated without Cause from his employment with
the Company or resigned from such employment for Good Reason.
       
      (b) Unless
otherwise agreed in writing by Purchaser, for a period of three (3) years from
and after the Closing Date, each Restricted Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates (including Affiliates who are Sellers) not to, directly or
indirectly:  (i) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any Material
Employees of the Company to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise
engage any such individual unless such Material Employee was terminated without
Cause from his employment with the Company or resigned from such employment for
Good Reason; or (ii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual or
prospective client, customer, supplier, or licensor of the Company (including
any existing customer of the Company and any Person that becomes a client or
customer of the Company after the Closing) or any other Person who has a
material business relationship with the Company, to terminate or modify any such
actual or prospective relationship.
       
      (c) From and
after the date hereof and continuing in perpetuity or until the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with 
ARTICLE IX, each
Seller shall not and shall use its best efforts to cause his or her directors,
officers, employees and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose,
reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized officers,
directors and employees of Purchaser or use or otherwise exploit for its own
benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser, any Confidential
Information (as defined below).  No Seller shall have any obligation
to keep confidential (or cause its officers, directors or Affiliates to keep
confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the extent
disclosure
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          53
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      thereof
is specifically required by applicable Law; provided, however, that in the event
disclosure is required by applicable Law, the Sellers shall, to the extent
reasonably possible, provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such requirement
prior to making any disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate
protective order.  For purposes of this Section 
 6.8
 (c), “Confidential
Information” means any information with respect to the Company, including
methods of operation, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, Technology,
inventions, Trade Secrets, know-how, Software, marketing methods, plans,
personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized information or
proprietary matters.  “Confidential
Information” does not include, and there shall be no obligation hereunder
with respect to, information that (i) is generally available to the public
on the date of the disclosure or (ii) becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible
hereunder, (iii) was known to the receiving party prior to such disclosure by
the Seller hereunder (other than any Confidential Information disclosed to the
receiving party on a basis under which the receiving party is bound by
confidentiality obligations) as evidenced by documentary or other physical
evidence predating the date of the disclosure or (iv) was lawfully disclosed or
made available to the receiving party by a third party having no obligation to
the Seller to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
       
      (d) The
covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 
 6.8 relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this Section 
 6.8 will cause
irreparable injury to Purchaser, the amount of which will be impossible to
estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated.  Accordingly, the remedy at Law for any breach of this
Section 
 6.8 will be
inadequate.  Therefore, Purchaser will be entitled to a temporary and
permanent injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 
 6.8 without the
necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond
whatsoever.  The rights and remedies provided by this Section 
 6.8 are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may
have hereunder at law or in equity.
       
      (e) The
parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction determines
that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a specified
business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section 
 6.8 is
unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then this Section 
 6.8 shall be
deemed a covenant for such lesser period of time, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by such court to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy and such covenant as
modified shall remain in full force and effect and may be enforced against the
applicable party.  Additionally, the parties intend that this covenant
shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants for each Seller and that
the invalidity of any portion of this Section 
 6.8 as to any
Seller shall not effect the validity of such covenants as to any other
Seller.
       
      (f) The
covenants set forth in this Section 
 6.8 are intended
to function as an agreement separate from the remainder of this Agreement and
the invalidity of any portion of this Section 
 6.8 shall not
affect the continued validity of any other portion of this
Agreement.
       
      6.9 Preservation of
Records.  Subject to any retention requirements relating to the
preservation of Tax records, the Sellers and Purchaser agree that each of them
shall (and shall cause the Company to) preserve and keep the records held by
them relating to the respective

      businesses
of the Company for a period of seven years from the Closing Date and shall make
such records and personnel available to the other as may be reasonably required
by such party in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by,
legal proceedings against or governmental investigations of the Sellers, the
Company or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable the
Sellers or Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby
or thereby.  In the event the Sellers or Purchaser wishes to destroy
(or permit to be destroyed) such records after that time, such party shall first
give 90 days prior written notice to the other and
such other party shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior
written notice given to such party within that 90-day period, to take possession
of the records within that 90-day period.
       
      6.10 Publicity.
       
      (a) None of
the Purchaser, the Company or the Sellers shall issue any press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless disclosure
is otherwise required, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, by applicable
Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Purchaser or its
Affiliates lists securities, provided that, to the extent required by applicable
Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other
party with respect to the text thereof.
       
      (b) Each of
Purchaser and the Sellers agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall not be
disclosed or otherwise made available to the public and that copies of this
Agreement shall not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the public,
except where such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable
Law and only to the extent required by such Law.  In the event that
such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law, each of
Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers (as applicable) agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain “confidential treatment” of this
Agreement with the SEC (or the equivalent treatment by any other Governmental
Authority) and to redact such terms of this Agreement the other party shall
request.
       
      6.11 Use of Name.  The
Sellers hereby agree that upon the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall have
the sole right to the use of the name “LenSx” or similar names and any service
marks, trademarks, trade names, d/b/a names, fictitious names, identifying
symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto or containing or
comprising the foregoing, or otherwise used in the business of the Company,
including any name or mark confusingly similar thereto and the Marks listed on
Schedule 
 4.13(a)
(collectively, the “Company
Marks”).  The Sellers shall not, and shall not permit their
respective Affiliates to, use such name or any variation or simulation thereof
or any of the Company Marks.  Each of the Sellers shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to, immediately after the Closing, cease to hold
itself out as having any affiliation with the Company or any of its
Affiliates.

(B) such Company Option’s pro-rata portion (as shown on Exhibit B hereto) of (x) the

accordance with Section 
 6.12
 (a)
 (ii)), shall
terminate as of the Closing and shall not thereafter be exercisable for any
Company Securities or otherwise be of any further force and effect;
       
      (iv) the LenSx
Lasers, Inc. 2007 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, as amended March 24,
2010 (the “Company
Option Plan”) shall terminate and all rights under the Company Option
Plan and any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of
the Company shall be cancelled; and
       
      (v) no Person
shall have any right to equity securities of the Company.

amounts payable pursuant to this Section 
 6.12

writing (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser): (A) that a
failure to exercise such Person’s Company Options prior to the Closing or
execute an Option Termination Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I will
result in the termination of such Company Options contemporaneously with the
Closing without receipt of, or the right to any
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          56
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      future
receipt of, any consideration therefor, (B) that upon execution of an
Option Termination Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I such
holder of Company Options will have the right to receive the consideration
specified in Section 
 6.12
 (a)(ii) but will
not have any rights to receive any portion of any Earnout Payment or amounts

the Company shall (a) terminate all Contracts with any of the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates (other than (i) those Contracts set forth on

(ii) Contracts (other than employment contracts entered in to in the
Ordinary Course of Business) between the Company and its employees and
(b) deliver releases executed by such Sellers and their respective
Affiliates with whom the Company has terminated such Contracts pursuant to this
Schedule 
 6.13 providing
that no further payments are due, or may become due, under or in respect of any
such terminated Contracts; provided that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay any fee or otherwise incur any expense or financial exposure
with respect to any such termination or release.
       
      6.14 Monthly Financial

      6.16 Notification of Certain
Matters.  The Company shall give notice to Purchaser and
Purchaser shall give notice to the Sellers, as promptly as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware of (a) any fact, change, condition,
circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence that has caused or is

             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          57
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      and prior

satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder or (c) the institution of or the written threat or bona fide
oral threat of institution of any Legal Proceeding against any of the Sellers or
the Company related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 
 6.16 shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice, or the representations or warranties of, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereto.  Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall update Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto
(including the pro-rata percentages shown thereon) as necessary to reflect the

estimate of the balance of all Indebtedness of the Company as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
(ii) customary pay-off letters from all holders of Indebtedness to be

arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser for such holders to provide to
Purchaser recordable form mortgage and lien releases, canceled notes and other
documents reasonably requested by Purchaser prior to the Closing such that all
Liens on the assets or properties of the Company that are not Permitted
Exceptions shall be satisfied, terminated and discharged on or prior to the
Closing Date.  On the Closing Date prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate of the Company setting forth all
Indebtedness of the Company as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.
       
      6.18 Interim Debt
Financing.  In the event that the Closing has not occurred by
the one month anniversary of the date hereof due to the Closing condition in
Section 
 7.1(g) not yet
being satisfied, Purchaser will provide (or will cause its Affiliates to
provide) the Company with interim debt financing in an aggregate amount not to
exceed $12,000,000 (the “Interim Debt
Financing”) for the Company to use in a manner consistent with the June
Business Plan (and Purchaser shall not be obligated to provide any Interim
Financing for uses inconsistent with such plan).  The Interim Debt
Financing will be provided pursuant to one or more promissory notes in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F (with
no more than $6,000,000 of the Interim Debt Financing being advanced in any
calendar quarter and no more than one such advance to be made in each calendar
quarter) and will provide for the payment of all principal and accrued interest
thereunder upon the earlier of the date that is (i) twelve (12) months from
the first date on which any Interim Debt Financing is advanced to the Company
pursuant hereto, or (ii) fifteen (15) days following the date on which the
Company closes any equity financing which brings the aggregate amount of equity
financing it has secured following the date hereof to at least
$30,000,000.
       
      6.19 Second Step
Merger.  If, following the Closing, there are any Remaining
Shares not acquired by Purchaser as of the Closing and, within thirty (30) days
following the Closing the holders of such Remaining Shares have not agreed to
execute a Post-Closing Counterpart Signature Page then as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, Purchaser shall effect a “short form” merger
pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “Merger”), pursuant to
which it will acquire all of the Remaining Shares not acquired at the Closing
(other than any Dissenting Shares) at the Per-Share Fair Market Value, provided,
that
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          58
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      6.20 such
Merger consideration need not provide for any deductions or holdbacks therefrom
of the types deducted or held back pursuant to this Agreement (including any
Adjustment Holdback, Appraisal Holdback, contributions to the Initial Escrow
Balance, any Escrowed Earnout Amount or the Representative Expense Amount) and,
if such deductions or holdbacks are not provided for, an appropriate adjustment
may be made to the per-Share Merger consideration to take into account the fact
that such deductions will not be made therefrom.  The Merger
consideration shall be paid by Purchaser from (or, if paid by the Company, shall
be deemed to reduce) the Appraisal Holdback.  The Merger shall be
completed by merging a newly formed subsidiary of the Purchaser into the
Company.
       
      6.21 Directors and Officers
Insurance.
       
      (a) Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay for, a “claims-made” “tail”
policy under the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy,
which (i) has an effective term of six years from the Closing Date, (ii) covers
only those persons who are currently covered by the Company’s directors’ and
officers’ insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof and only for actions
and omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) contains
terms and conditions (including, without limitation, coverage amounts) that are
no less advantageous, when taken as a whole, to those applicable to the current
directors and officers of the Company.  This Section 
6.20 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit each Company
Indemnified Person, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Company and Purchaser, and shall be enforceable by the Company Indemnified
Persons.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Section 
6.20 shall affect
any rights of Purchaser to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to
events occurring prior to, or circumstances existing at, the Closing
Date.
       
      (b) Contingent
on the Company’s having met its obligation under Section 
 6.20
 (a), from and
after the Closing until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its
directors and officers as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (the “Company Indemnified
Persons”) pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Company’s
certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and
such Company Indemnified Parties existing as of the Agreement Date (the “Company Indemnification
Provisions”), with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date.  In connection therewith,
Purchaser shall advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Persons as incurred
to the fullest extent provided for under the Company Indemnification
Provisions.  Any claims for indemnification made under this Section 
6.20
 (b) on or prior
to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date shall survive such anniversary until the final
resolution thereof.
       
      6.22 Employee
Matters.  As of and following the Closing Date, Purchaser will
either (a) continue the employee benefit plans in effect on the Closing
Date, (b) permit employees of the Company who continue employment with Purchaser
or the Company following the Closing Date (“Continuing
Employees”), and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to
participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including
without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, per personal
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          59
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      time off
plans or programs) of Purchaser on terms no less favorable than those provided
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser, or (c) a combination of clauses
(a) and (b).  To the extent Purchaser elects to have Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit
plans, program or policies following the Closing Date, (i) each such Continuing
Employee will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting under such plan for years of service with the Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries), and (ii) Purchaser will cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any group health plans of Purchaser in which such employees
and their eligible dependents will participate to be waived and will provide
credit for any co-payments and deductibles prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar
requirements under any such plans that may apply after the Closing
Date.
       
      6.23 Resignation of
Directors.  Upon Closing the directors of the Company shall
deliver to the Company signed resignations from their seats on the Board of
Directors.
       
      6.24 401(k) Plan.  At
Purchaser’s written request, delivered no later than thirty (30) days after the
date hereof, the Company shall terminate the 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan")
effective immediately prior to the Closing, shall cease all further
contributions to the 401(k) Plan for pay periods beginning on and after the
Closing Date and, to the extent the 401(k) Plan provides for loans to
participants, shall cease making any such additional loans effective immediately
prior to the Closing Date.  If Purchaser so directs the Company to
terminate the 401(k) plan, the Company agrees to cooperate with Purchaser after
the Closing Date to amend the 401(k) Plan in order to bring the 401(k) Plan into
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, to vest all participants in
their accounts, to distribute all such accounts to the extent permitted under
applicable laws and regulations and to bear all expenses that may apply in
connection with obtaining a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan at
its termination.  If Purchaser opts not to instruct the Company to
terminate the 401(k) Plan, nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Company
or Purchaser from terminating the 401(k) Plan following the Closing in
accordance with applicable Law.
       
      6.25 Certain
Waivers.  Each Seller (including any “Significant Investor” as
defined in any executory Right of First Offer and Co-Sale Agreement relating to
shares of the Company to which the stockholders of the Company are a party),
severally, and the Company, hereby waives any and all first refusal, first offer
or veto or other rights under the certificate of incorporation of the Company or
any agreement to which it is a party with respect to the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.  Additionally, each holder of the Company’s Preferred Stock
hereby waives any right to treat the transactions contemplated hereby as a
“waiver, dissolution or winding up” of the Company under the certificate of
incorporation of the Company or any agreement to which it is a
party.
       
      6.26 Valuation
Opinion.  The parties acknowledge that Purchaser has retained
Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin, Inc. to deliver a valuation opinion as to
the Per-Share Fair Market Value on the Closing Date (the “Valuation
Opinion”).  The parties hereto agree to use, if available when
required, the amount of the Per-Share Fair Market Value derived therefrom for
all Tax purposes relating to the transactions under this Agreement which are
dependent upon the
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          60
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      fair
market value of the Company’s common stock including, but not limited to, the
calculation of the amount of the fair market value of Shares received upon the
exercise of Company Options prior to Closing.  Nothing herein shall
obligate Purchaser to share the entirety of the Valuation Opinion (other than
the result thereof) with Sellers or the Company.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that prior to the Valuation Opinion becoming available,
the Company obtains the Parachute Payment Approval, the Company shall clearly
advise all stockholders approving such Parachute Payment Approval that
(i) the Valuation Opinion is forthcoming, (ii) the Per-Share Fair
Market Value derived therefrom may be materially different from the fair market
value being used in connection with the Parachute Payment Approval and
(iii) the Per-Share Fair Market Value will ultimately be dispositive in

Waiver.

Company shall deliver to Purchaser, prior to the initiation of the requisite
stockholder approval procedure under Section

 (b), a Parachute
Payment Waiver, in substantially the form attached as Exhibit H, from each
Person identified on Schedule 
 6.26, which lists
each individual who is, with respect to the Company and/or any ERISA Affiliate,
a “disqualified individual” (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to
the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under Section 
 6.26, and who
might otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a
parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code as a result of (i) the
accelerated vesting or “cashing out” of such Person’s Company Options and/or the
termination of employment or service with the Company or Purchaser before, upon
or following the Closing, (ii) any Change of Control Payment, and/or (iii) the
receipt of any Company Options within the 12-month period ending on the Closing

or entitlement to the accelerated vesting, payments, benefits, options and stock
referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) to the extent the value thereof
exceeds 2.99 times such Person’s base amount determined in accordance with
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, unless
the requisite stockholder approval of such accelerated vesting, payments,
benefits, options and stock is obtained pursuant to this Section 
 6.26.
       
      (b) The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval
(the “Parachute
Payment Approval”) by such number of shareholders of the Company as is
required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) so as to render the
parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to
any and all accelerated vesting payments, benefits, options and/or stock
provided pursuant to agreements, contracts or arrangements that might otherwise
result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the
provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason of
Section 280G of the Code, with such shareholder vote to be obtained in a
manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

agreements shall be disregarded.
       
      (e) The
Sellers shall have no right of contribution or other recourse against the

      8.4 Indemnification
Procedures.
       
      (a) A claim
for indemnification for any matter not involving a third party claim may be
asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought; provided,
however, that failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not preclude the
indemnified party from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with
this 
ARTICLE
VIII.
       
      (b) In the
event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any claim or demand
shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which indemnification may be
sought under Section 
 8.2 hereof
(regardless of the limitations set forth in Section 
 8.3) (a “Third Party Claim”),
the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of
any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party.  The failure of
the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim
shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party’s
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying
party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such
failure.  Subject to the provisions of this Section 
 8.4, the
indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be represented
by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder; provided that the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in
writing to the indemnified party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party as provided hereunder.  If the indemnifying party
elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, it shall
within five (5) days of the indemnified party’s written notice of the
assertion

      of such
Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so; provided, that
(i) the indemnifying party must conduct the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this
regard, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing to
the indemnified party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party as provided hereunder, (iii) after giving effect to any applicable
Deductible, caps and the limitations on recourse specified in Section 
 8.6, it is
reasonably anticipated that, as between the indemnifying party and the
indemnified parties, the indemnifying party will actually bear financial
responsibility for fifty percent (50%) or more of any Losses resulting from such
Third Party Claim, and (iv) the indemnifying party can be reasonably
anticipated to have the financial wherewithal (including as a result of any
monies in the Escrow Account or any anticipated Earnout Payments) to indemnify
the indemnified party if the Third-Party Claim is successful.  If the
indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein
provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such
Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim.  If
the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party
shall reimburse the indemnified party for the expenses of defending such Third
Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills.  If the indemnifying
party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party
may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified
party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation advisable;
and provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay
for more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with
any Third Party Claim.  The parties hereto agree to provide reasonable
access to the other to such documents and information as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
Third Party Claim.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 
 8.4 to the
contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall,
without the written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the
claimant or claimants and such party provide to such other party an unqualified
release from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim.
       
      (c) After any
final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to
appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement, in each case with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder,
the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums
due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to such matter and the indemnifying party shall pay all of such remaining sums
so due and owing to the indemnified party in accordance with Section

      8.5 Tax Matters.
       
      (a) Tax
Indemnification.  The Sellers hereby agree, jointly and
severally, to be liable for and to indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties harmless from and against, and pay to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
the amount of any and all Losses in respect of (i) all Taxes of the Company
(or any predecessor thereof) (A) for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, and (B) for the portion of any Straddle Period
ending at the close of business on the Closing Date (determined as provided in
Section 
 8.5
 (c));
(ii) any and all Taxes imposed on any member of a consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which the Company (or any predecessor thereof) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, by reason of the liability of the
Company (or any predecessor thereof), pursuant to United States Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or successor thereof or
any analogous or similar provision under state, local or foreign Law);
(iii) the failure of any of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 
 4.10 to be true
and correct in all respects (determined without regard to any qualification
related to materiality contained therein) or the failure to perform any covenant
contained in this Agreement with respect to Taxes; and (iv) any failure by
the Sellers to timely pay any and all Taxes required to be borne by the Sellers
pursuant to Section 
 8.5
 (e); except to
the extent any such Taxes are reflected as a reduction to Closing Working
Capital on the Closing Working Capital Statement.
       
      (b) Filing of Tax Returns;
Payment of Taxes.
       
      (i) The
Company shall timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or prior
to the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due
thereon.  All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with prior practice; provided, however, that the Company shall not
make any election pursuant to Code Section 59(e) to capitalize any “qualified
expenditures” as defined in such Section on the Company’s federal income tax
return and any applicable state and local income tax returns for the period
ending December 31, 2009 and any other periods ending after December 31, 2009
and on or before the Closing Date.  The Company shall provide
Purchaser with copies of such completed Tax Returns at least twenty days prior
to the due date for filing thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for
Purchaser’s review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).  The Sellers’ Representatives and Purchaser shall attempt
in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to
the due date for filing.  In the event that the Sellers’
Representatives and the Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect
to such Tax Return at least ten days prior to the due date for filing, such
dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 
 8.5
 (f) which
resolution shall be binding on the parties.
       
      (ii) Following
the Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Company after the Closing Date and, subject to the rights to
payment from the Sellers under Section 
 8.5
 (b)
 (iii), pay or
cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon.
       
      (iii) Not later
than ten days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes on any Tax Returns
which Purchaser has the responsibility to cause to be filed pursuant to Section 
 8.5
 (b)
 (ii), the Sellers
shall pay to Purchaser the amount of Taxes, as reasonably determined by
Purchaser, owed by the Sellers pursuant to the provisions of Section 
 8.5.  No

      payment
pursuant to this Section 
 8.5
 (b)
 (iii) shall
excuse the Sellers from their indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 
 8.5 if the amount
of Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise) for the periods
covered by such Tax Returns exceeds the amount of the Sellers’ payment under
this Section 
 8.5
 (b)
 (iii).
       
      (c) Straddle Period Tax
Allocation.  The Company shall, unless prohibited by applicable
Law, close the taxable period of the Company as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.  If applicable law does not permit the Company to close
its taxable year on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed
with respect to a taxable period which includes the Closing Date (but does not
begin or end on that day) (a “Straddle Period”),
the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated
(i) to the Sellers for the period up to and including the close of business
on the Closing Date, except to the extent such Taxes were already accounted for
in the Net Working Capital Adjustment as a reduction to Closing Working Capital
on the Closing Working Capital Statement, and (ii) to Purchaser for the
period subsequent to the Closing Date.  Any allocation of income or
deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period
shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company as
of the close of the Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited
to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between
the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period.  In the case of
any Taxes of the Company imposed on a periodic basis (including real property
and ad valorem Taxes) the allocation between Purchaser and the Sellers described
in this Section 
 8.5
 (c) shall be made
based on the number of days during the Straddle Period on or before the Closing
Date, on the one hand, and the number of days in the Straddle Period after the
Closing Date, on the other hand.
       
      (d) Tax
Audits.
       
      (i) If notice
of any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company (a “Tax Claim”) shall be
received by either party for which the other party may reasonably be expected to
be liable pursuant to Section 
 8.5
 (a), the notified
party shall notify such other party in writing of such Tax Claim; provided,
however, that the failure of the notified party to give the other party notice
as provided herein shall not relieve such failing party of its obligations under
this Section 
 8.5 except to the
extent that the other party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby.
       
      (ii) Purchaser
shall have the right, at the expense of the Sellers to the extent such Tax Claim
is subject to indemnification by the Sellers pursuant to Section 
 8.5 hereof, to
represent the interests of the Company in any Tax Claim; provided, that with
respect to a Tax Claim relating exclusively to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date for which Sellers may reasonably be expected to be
liable pursuant to Section 
 8.5
 (a), Purchaser
shall not settle such claim without the consent of the Sellers, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
       
      (e) Transfer Taxes and Payment
of Other Taxes.  The Sellers shall severally be liable for and
shall pay (and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties against) all sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording,
transfer or similar fees or
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15

      taxes or
governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Authority including any
interest and penalties) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.  Each Party shall bear all other Taxes arising as a
result or payable in respect of this Agreement or its implementation, all to the
extent such Taxes apply on each Party under applicable law.
       
      (f) Disputes.  Any
dispute as to any matter covered hereby shall be resolved by an independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the
Purchaser.  The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be
borne equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser on the
other.  If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved
prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the
manner which the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems
correct.
       
      (g) Time
Limits.  Any claim for indemnity under this Section 
 8.5 may be made
at any time prior to sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable Tax
statute of limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (including
all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive).
       
      (h) Exclusivity.  The
indemnification provided for in this Section 
 8.5 shall be the
sole remedy for any claim in respect of Taxes, including any claim arising out
of or relating to a breach of Section 
 4.10.  In
the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 
 8.5, on the one
hand, and the provisions of Sections 
 8.1 through 
8.3, on the
other, the provisions of this Section 
 8.5 shall
control.
       
      (i) Tax Treatment of Indemnity
Payments.  The Sellers and the Purchaser agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this 
ARTICLE III as an
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for all income tax
purposes.  If, notwithstanding the treatment required by the preceding
sentence, any indemnification payment under 
ARTICLE III
(including this Section 
 8.5) is
determined to be taxable to the party receiving such payment by any Taxing
Authority, the paying party shall also indemnify the party receiving such
payment for any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of such payment and any
Losses incurred by the party receiving such payment in connection with such
Taxes (or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding,
judgment or assessment, including the defense or settlement thereof, relating to
such Taxes).
       
      8.6 Recourse for Indemnity
Claims.
       
      (a) Any
payment the Sellers are obligated to make to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this 
ARTICLE IV (other
than Section 
 8.7 hereof) shall
be paid:
       
      (i) first, to
the extent there are sufficient funds in the Escrow Account, by release of funds
to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent
within five (5) Business Days after the date notice of any sums due and owing is
given to the Sellers (by delivery to the Sellers’ Representatives) (with a copy
to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) by the applicable
Purchaser Indemnified Party and shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Balance;
and
       
      (ii) second,
by withholding of funds from any future Earnout Payments (including from the
portion of any Earnout Payment not constituting an Escrowed Earnout
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          71
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      Amount,
such that any Escrowed Earnout Amount will be deposited in the Escrow Account
without prior deduction).
       
      (b) Notwithstanding
Section 
 8.6
 (a), to the
extent that any Seller is obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 
 8.2(a)(ii), the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties (i) shall be permitted (but shall not be
required) to recover such sums due and owing in accordance with the priorities
specified in Section 
 8.6
 (a), and may in,
lieu thereof (ii) require such Seller to pay all sums due and owing to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice; provided, however,
that, except in the event of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the maximum
amount the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may recover from any Seller pursuant to
this clause (b) shall not exceed the cash distributions to such Seller pursuant
to this Agreement (including the actual or later release of any Escrow Amount or
any Earnout Payment) (treating any withholding Taxes withheld on amounts paid to
such Seller, or other amounts withheld pre-Tax on amounts otherwise payable to
any Sellers, as if they had been paid to such Seller for this
purpose).
       
      (c) To the
extent that, on the date any Earnout Payment is to be made there exist indemnity
claims which were asserted by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period and which are not yet resolved
(“Unresolved
Claims”) the Purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to) retain an
amount (up to the total amount of the Earnout Payment) equal to the amount of
the Unresolved Claims (subject to the limitations in Section 
 8.3) but only to
the extent that the amount of such Unresolved Claims exceeds the then-current
Escrow Balance (including any Escrowed Earnout Amount to be deposited into the
Escrow Account in connection with such Earnout Payment(s), if any) which is not
then subject to a notice on account to any prior Unresolved
Claim.  Any portion of an Earnout Payment retained by Purchaser for
Unresolved Claims shall be released by Purchaser (to the extent not utilized to
pay Purchaser for any such claims resolved in favor of a Purchaser Indemnified
Party) upon their resolution in accordance with this 
ARTICLE
III.
       
      8.7 Freedom to Operate Payments and
Recourse.  Except for any Royalty FTO Payments paid by
Purchaser or its Affiliates for any Base Earnout Year in which Deemed Net
Revenue does not exceed Target Net Revenue (which economic burden shall be borne
solely by Purchaser), each of Purchaser and Sellers shall bear fifty percent
(50%) of the economic burden of any FTO Payments in the manner set forth in this
Section 
 8.7.
       
      (a) One-Time FTO

Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business Days after the date
notice of any sums due and owing is given to the Sellers (by delivery to the
Sellers’ Representatives) (with a copy to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement) by Purchaser Indemnified Party and shall accordingly reduce
the Escrow Balance; and

portion of any Earnout Payment not constituting an Escrowed Earnout Amount, such
that any Escrowed Earnout Amount will be deposited in the Escrow Account without
prior deduction).
       
      (b) Royalty FTO
Payments.
       
      (i) Prior to
the Escrow Release Date Sellers shall bear the economic burden of fifty percent
of any Royalty FTO Payments solely through the deduction from Deemed Gross
Revenue contemplated by clause (ii) of the definition of “Deemed Net
Revenue.”
       
      (ii) Following
the Escrow Release Date Sellers shall bear the economic burden of fifty percent
(50%) of any Royalty FTO Payments solely by release of funds to Purchaser from
the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent (no more frequently than on a quarterly
basis) equal to fifty percent (50%) of such Royalty FTO Payments made by
Purchaser (and not previously recovered by Purchaser through an offset against
Deemed Gross Revenue or through a previous release from the Escrow Account), to
the extent there are sufficient funds in the Escrow Account, within five (5)
Business Days after the date notice of any sums due and owing is given to the
Sellers (with a copy to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) by
Purchaser and shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Balance.
       
      (c) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall not be obligated to bear fifty
percent (50%) of the economic burden of any FTO Payments to the extent that such
fifty percent (50%) burden (including by way of offset from Deemed Gross Revenue
in the computation of Deemed Net Revenue pursuant to clause (ii) of the
definition thereof and by way of recourse to the Escrow Account) exceeds in the
aggregate, when aggregated with any indemnifiable Losses which are subject to
the Cap, $200,000,000 (the “FTO
Cap”).

Documents and any agreements entered into by any of the Sellers amongst
themselves simultaneously with this Agreement.
       
      (b) Each
Releasor hereby expressly waives and relinquishes, to the full extent that such
rights and benefits may be waived, all rights and benefits under any statute or
law of the United States or any state, territory or jurisdiction thereof, which
provides that a general release does not extend to claims which such Releasor
does not know or suspect to exist in his, her or its favor at the time of
executing the release, which if known by him, her or it must have materially
affected his, her or its settlement with the released party.  Each Releasor acknowledges that
it is familiar with and understands the provisions of Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code, which provides as follows:
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          75
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      A GENERAL
RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO
EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN
BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY EFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE
DEBTOR.
       
      In this
regard, each Releasor acknowledges that he, she or it is aware that any of the
Releasors or their respective attorneys may hereafter discover claims or facts
in addition to or different from those which the Releasors or their respective
attorneys now know or believe to exist with respect to the subject matter of the
foregoing releases, and it is his, her or its intention hereby to fully,
finally, and forever settle and release all possible claims purported to be
released hereunder that he, she or it may have against the Released
Parties.  Further, it is expressly understood that notwithstanding the
discovery or existence of any such additional or different claims or facts, the
release given herein shall be and remain in effect as a full and complete
release with respect to all Claims released hereunder.  The release in
this Section 
 10.1 is for any
relief, no matter how denominated, including, but not limited to, injunctive
relief, wages, front pay, compensatory damages, or punitive
damages.  The release in this Section 
 10.1 may not be
changed orally or in writing, except as provided in Section 
 10.8
hereof.
       
      (c) The
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Section 
 10.1 shall not
affect or limit the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof and
if any particular provision of this Section 
 10.1 shall be
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed
amended to delete therefrom the portion thus adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such deletion to apply only with respect to the operation of such
provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Section 
 10.1 as to any
Releasor shall not affect or limit the validity or enforceability of this Section 
 10.1 to any other
Releasor.
       
      (d) Each
Releasor represents and agrees that (i) he, she or it has been encouraged
to consult with an attorney of his, her or its choice concerning his, her or its
rights and the release granted in this Section 
 10.1,
(ii) he, she or it has thoroughly discussed all aspects of the release
granted in this Section 
 10.1 and his, her
or its rights with his, her or its own attorney or other advisor of his, her or
its choice to the full extent he, she or it wanted to do so before signing this
Agreement, (iii) he, she or it understands he, she or it is waiving legal
rights or claims by signing this Agreement, (iv) he, she or it has
carefully read and fully understands this Agreement and the release granted in
this Section 
 10.1, and
(v) he, she or it is voluntarily signing this Agreement.
       
      (e) Each
Releasor acknowledges that in entering this Agreement and the release
contemplated hereby he, she or it has done so freely and voluntarily and with
knowledge of all the material facts, and not as a result of any duress,
concealment, fraud, or undue influence.
       
      (f) To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, each Releasor covenants, agrees and promises
that he, she or it will not file any claim, charge or action asserting any such
Claims and, that if such a Claim is brought on such Releasor’s behalf or for
such Releasor’s benefit in or by any court or administrative agency, such
Releasor hereby waives and agrees not to take any award or money or other
damages as a result of such Claim.  No Releasor shall aid
or
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15

      assist
any other Person in connection with the pursuit of any Claim that could not be
brought by such Releasor hereunder, except in the case of a court order or
validly issued subpoena.
       
      10.2 Sellers’
Representatives.
       
      (a) Appointment.  Each
Initial Seller and, upon execution of a counterpart signature page, each Joining
Seller party to this Agreement, irrevocably approves the constitution and
appointment of, and hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints William Link and
James Garvey (each
a “Seller
Representative” and together the “Sellers’
Representatives”) jointly and severally with all the rights, powers and
obligations contemplated by this Section 
 10.2, and any
successor Sellers’ Representative(s) designated under this Section 
 10.2 as the sole,
exclusive, true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact, with full
power of substitution, for and on behalf of all Sellers, and each of them, with
respect to any and all matters arising out of this Agreement following the
Closing (including in connection with the Escrow Account) and the Escrow
Agreement, including for purposes of taking any action or omitting to take
action on behalf of all Sellers or each of them hereunder.  All
actions, notices, communications and determinations by or on behalf of the
Sellers in accordance herewith shall be given or made by the Sellers’
Representatives and all such actions, notices, and determinations by the
Sellers’ Representative shall conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by,
and shall be binding upon, any and all Sellers.  This power of
attorney is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.
       
      (b) Each
Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on
instructions received from any one (1) of the Sellers’ Representatives
individually and shall not require joint instructions from both Sellers’
Representatives.
       
      (c) Authority After the Closing
Date.  From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers’
Representatives shall be authorized jointly and severally under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement to:
       
      (i) take all
actions required or permitted by, and exercise all rights granted to, the
Sellers’ Representatives in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;
       
      (ii) receive
all notices or other documents given or to be given to the Sellers’
Representatives or Sellers by Purchaser, the Company or the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;
       
      (iii) negotiate,
undertake, compromise, defend, resolve and settle any suit, proceeding or
dispute under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the
Sellers;
       
      (iv) execute
and deliver all agreements, certificates and documents required or deemed
appropriate by the Sellers’ Representatives in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement;
       
      (v) engage
special counsel, accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Sellers;
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15
          
           

        
        
          77
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
       
      (vi) apply the
Representative Expense Amount to the payment of (or reimbursement of the
Sellers’ Representatives for) expenses and liabilities which the Sellers’
Representatives may incur pursuant to this Section 
10.2;
       
      (vii) approve
of and execute amendments to the Escrow Agreement pursuant thereto and/or to
this Agreement in accordance with Section 
10.8;
and
       
      (viii) take such
other action as the Sellers’ Representatives may deem appropriate on behalf of
the Sellers.
       
      (d) Should
the Sellers’ Representatives die, become legally incapacitated or bankrupt,
dissolve, liquidate or otherwise similarly be unable or unwilling to serve or to
appoint his or her successor to serve in his or her stead, the Sellers’ Majority
shall designate in writing to Purchaser within five (5) Business Days a Person
or Persons to replace the deceased or legally incapacitated or otherwise
similarly unable Sellers’ Representatives as the successor Sellers’
Representative hereunder.  If at any time there shall not be a
Sellers’ Representative and a Sellers’ Majority fails to designate in writing a
successor Sellers’ Representative within five (5) Business Days after receipt of
a written request delivered by Purchaser to the Sellers’ Majority requesting
that a successor Sellers’ Representative be designated, then the Purchaser may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a new Sellers’
Representative hereunder.
       
      (e) All of
the costs and expenses incurred by the Sellers’ Representatives in connection
with this Agreement shall be payable by the Sellers, initially out of funds
(totaling $1,000,000) which each Seller instructs the Purchaser to transfer
to the Sellers’ Representatives’ expense fund (the “Representative Expense
Amount”) described in Exhibit G.  Any
remaining funds not used by the Sellers’ Representatives will be paid to the
Sellers on a pro rata basis upon conclusion of the Sellers’ Representatives’
duties as Sellers’ Representative.
       
      (f) The
Sellers’ Representatives shall not be liable to the Sellers for any act done or
omitted hereunder in their capacity as the Sellers’ Representatives, unless
caused by his or her willful misconduct, bad faith or gross
negligence.  In all questions arising in respect of any matter arising
under this Agreement, the Sellers’ Representatives may rely on the advice of
counsel and any action based upon such reliance shall relieve the Sellers’
Representatives of any liability hereunder.  The Purchaser shall not
be liable to the Sellers for any act done or omitted hereunder by the Sellers’
Representatives.
       
      (g) Each
Seller shall severally and not jointly indemnify and defend the Sellers’
Representatives and hold the Sellers’ Representatives harmless against such
Seller’s pro rata share of any loss, liability, deficiency, damage, cost, or
expense, or actions incurred by the Sellers’ Representatives and arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the
Sellers’ Representatives’ duties under this Agreement (including, to the extent
applicable, the Escrow Agreement), including the reasonable fees and expenses of
any legal counsel, accountants, auditors and other advisors retained by the
Sellers’ Representatives.  Without limiting any remedy of the Sellers’
Representatives with respect to such losses, liabilities, deficiencies, damages,
costs, or expenses, or actions, as aforesaid, the Sellers’ Representatives shall
have recourse against the Escrow Balance prior to any distribution thereof to
the Sellers.

      (h) Reduction of Earnout
Payments to Replenish Representative Expense Amount.  The
Sellers’ Representatives, upon written notice delivered to Purchaser, shall be
entitled to cause the Purchaser to deposit with the Paying Agent all or a
portion of the proceeds of any Earnout Payment prior to making any distribution
of such Earnout Payment or distribution from the Escrow Agent to any Sellers for
purposes of (i) replenishing the Representative Expense Amount hereunder (which
amount may be increased from time to time in the discretion of the Sellers’
Representatives), or (ii) reimbursing the Sellers’ Representatives for the
amount of any expenses of the Sellers’ Representatives previously paid by the
Sellers’ Representatives and not discharged out of the Representative Expense
Amount.  For purposes of clarity, the parties hereto acknowledge that
any amounts that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to deduct from
any Earnout Payment pursuant to Sections 
 8.6 and 
8.7 shall have
priority over any deductions pursuant to this Section 
 10.2
 (h).
       
      (i) Distribution of
Representative Expense Amount.  Any of the Representative
Expense Amount deposited with the Sellers’ Representatives at the Closing or
pursuant to Section

10.2 that has not
been consumed by the Sellers’ Representatives may, in the discretion of the
Sellers’ Representatives, at any time, be paid to the Paying Agent to be
distributed to the Sellers, either as an increase to an Earnout Payment
otherwise due to be paid to the Sellers, or as a separate Earnout Payment
payable in accordance with all of the applicable terms of Section 
10.2.
       
      (j) Distribution of Amounts
released from Escrow Agent.  Any amounts deposited with the
Escrow Agent under this Agreement that are ultimately disbursed to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the Sellers shall be distributed by the Paying Agent
pursuant to directions delivered by the Sellers’ Representatives.  The
Sellers’ Representatives shall be entitled, in the exercise of his sole
discretion, to determine the timing of any such distributions (giving due regard
to the likelihood of contemporaneous distributions of other amounts by the
Paying Agent, or other factors of convenience or efficiency), and the allocation
of such distribution among the Sellers.
       
      10.3 Notices.  All
notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand (with written
confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile (with written
confirmation of transmission) or (iii) one Business Day following the
day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in each
case at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or to such other address
or facsimile number as a party may have specified by notice given to the other

      10.4 Specific
Performance.  The Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that a breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other
party will not have an adequate remedy at law.  Therefore, the
obligations of the Sellers and Purchaser under this Agreement, including the
Sellers’ obligation to sell the Company Securities to Purchaser,
shall
       
      
        
          
             
             DAL:0506861/00010:1931463v15

      be
enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted
in connection therewith.  Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative
and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party
may have under this Agreement or otherwise.
       
      10.5 Successors and
Assignees.
       
      (a) If the
Company Securities shall at any time be sold or transferred by Purchaser
following the Closing, the burdens and benefits of each of the obligations,
undertakings, indemnities, representations or warranties undertaken or given by
the Sellers or the Purchaser under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
assignable to the purchaser or transferee of the Company Securities and such
purchaser or transferee shall be entitled to enforce the same against the
Sellers as if it were named in this Agreement as the Purchaser and Sellers shall
be entitled to enforce the same against any such purchaser or transferee as if
such purchaser or transferee were named in this Agreement as the
Purchaser.
       
      (b) Save as
set out herein, no assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by either the Sellers or Purchaser (by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto
and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void;
provided, however, that Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any or all
rights or obligations hereunder (including Purchaser’s rights to purchase the
Company Securities and Purchaser’s rights to seek indemnification hereunder) to
any Affiliate of Purchaser or any Person to which Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates proposes to sell all or substantially all of the assets relating to
the business.  Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in
this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.
       
      (c) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
       
      10.6 Expenses.  Except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein, Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers
shall each be responsible for their respective costs in connection with
transactions contemplated hereby.  The Sellers shall be responsible
for costs in connection with (a) any other documents or actions relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) all expenses and
charges incurred by the Company in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
or execution of this Agreement and all ancillary documents.
       
      10.7 Delays or Omissions;
Waiver.  The rights of a party may be waived by such party only
in writing and specifically; the conduct of any one of the parties shall not be
deemed a waiver of any of its rights pursuant to this Agreement and/or as a
waiver or consent on its part as to any breach or failure to meet any of the
terms of this Agreement or as an amendment hereto.  No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein.  The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach.  No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay
in exercising, any right, power or

hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.  All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any other remedies provided by Law.
       
      10.8 Amendment.  This
Agreement (together with the recitals, schedules, appendices, annexes and
exhibits attached hereto) may be amended, supplemented or changed, and any
provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any
such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought.
       
      10.9 Entire
Agreement.  This Agreement (together with the recitals,
schedules, appendices, annexes and exhibits attached hereto) contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and all
prior negotiations, discussions, agreements, commitments and understandings
between them with respect thereto not expressly contained herein shall be null
and void in their entirety, effective immediately with no further action
required.
       
      10.10 Severability.
       
      (a) If any
term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms or provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable
of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.
       
      (b) Where
provisions of any applicable Law resulting in such illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability may be waived, they are hereby waived by each party to the full
extent permitted so that this Agreement shall be deemed valid and binding
agreements, in each case enforceable in accordance with its terms.
       
      10.11 Counterparts, Facsimile
Signatures.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  A signed
Agreement received by a party hereto via facsimile will be deemed an original,
and binding upon the party who signed it.
       
      10.12 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent
to Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial.
       
      (a) The
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court located within the State of Texas over any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related thereto may be
heard and determined in such courts.  The parties hereby irrevocably
waive,

      to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court
or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any
such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law.
       
      (b) Each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any party to this
Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a copy thereof in
accordance with the provisions of Section 
 10.12.

THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION
(i) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR
OTHERWISE.  THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
       
      10.13 Governing Law.  The
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles thereof relating to
conflict of laws.
       
      10.14 Further Actions.  At
any time and from time to time, each party agrees, without further
consideration, to take such actions and to execute and deliver such documents as
may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this
Agreement.
       
      10.15 No Third-Party
Beneficiaries.  Nothing in this Agreement shall create or
confer upon any person or entity, other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations
or liabilities, except as expressly provided herein.
