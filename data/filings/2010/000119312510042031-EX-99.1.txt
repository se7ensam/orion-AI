No dividend on common shares Statement of Alex
Wynaendts, CEO  “Clearly, the steps we have taken over the past year have delivered solid results - a return to profit, reduced
expenses, and continued customer confidence, resulting in increased sales in all country units. AEGON today is in a stronger financial position, which enabled us to repay one-third of the capital we obtained from the Dutch government. Given the
uncertain environment, we believe that it continues to be prudent to maintain a substantial capital buffer, as reflected in our strong capital position. Although impairments improved during the quarter, they remained at elevated levels for the year,
which led to lower cash flows from our operating units. Consequently, AEGON will not declare a dividend to common shareholders. Looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy will continue to reinforce AEGON’s strong position in the
gradually improving economic environment.”  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

   STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS      AEGON continued to deliver on its strategic priorities:   







   ¡
  
To reallocate capital toward business with higher growth and return prospects




   ¡
  
To improve growth and returns from existing businesses




   ¡
  
To reduce financial markets risk




   ¡
  
To manage AEGON as an international company. Portfolio
review  AEGON continues to assess its businesses to ensure they meet requirements in terms of earnings growth, cash flow and return on
capital. As part of this review, AEGON sold its funeral insurance business in the Netherlands in January 2010 for EUR 212 million. The sale will have a positive effect on AEGON’s excess capital position and is expected to result in a modest
book gain in the first half of 2010.  Cost measures  During 2009, AEGON realized cost reduction measures of EUR 250 million, significantly above the company’s target for the year of EUR 150 million. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges,
increased employee benefit expenses in the United States and currency movements, operating costs decreased in 2009 by 5% on a comparable basis.  AEGON’s total workforce, excluding agent employees, declined by 7% during the year to just over 25,000 employees. The decline was due mainly to restructuring in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as the sale of real
estate brokerage activities in the Netherlands and the sale of the company’s life insurance operations in Taiwan.  Capital &
risk management  Capital preservation  During the fourth quarter of 2009, a further EUR 0.8 billion of capital was released from AEGON’s businesses, bringing the total for 2009 as a whole to EUR 3.3 billion.  Excess capital   







   ¡
  
Excess capital above S&P AA capital adequacy requirements amounted to EUR 3.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter 2009, down from EUR 4.8 billion at the end of third
quarter of 2009. The decline was due primarily to repayment of one-third of the EUR 3 billion in core capital provided by the Dutch State at the end of 2008. The repayment, including interest and premium for repayment, totaled EUR 1.15
billion.




   ¡
  
De-risking and capital efficiency measures added EUR 0.8 billion to excess capital but were offset by other items, mainly related to higher regulatory and rating agency capital
requirements for longevity and default provisioning. Statutory earnings of EUR 0.3 billion were partly offset by impairments of EUR 0.2 billion.




   ¡
  
Under current uncertain circumstances, AEGON aims to maintain a substantial capital buffer. Core capital   







   ¡
  
At year-end 2009, core capital, excluding the revaluation reserves, amounted to EUR 15.9 billion or 75% of the total capital base, well above AEGON’s self-imposed minimum
target of 70%6,7.




   ¡
  
Core capital, including the revaluation reserves, totaled EUR 14.2 billion, comprising EUR 12.2 billion in shareholders’ equity and a further EUR 2 billion in convertible
core capital securities.




   ¡
  
Shareholders’ equity per common share of EUR 5.88.




   ¡
  
The revaluation reserves amounted to a negative EUR 1.7 billion, a marginal improvement from the third quarter of 2009 as the positive effects of tightening credit spreads were
almost entirely offset by the impact of rising risk-free interest rates and realized gains.




   ¡
  
At the end of December 31, 2009, the Insurance Group Directive (IGD) capital surplus totaled EUR 6.7 billion, equivalent to a solvency ratio of
204%. Improved risk profile  As announced in February last year, AEGON is running off its institutional spread-based business in the United States. The run-off will significantly reduce AEGON’s exposure to credit risk and help
lessen overall sensitivity to fluctuations in financial markets. During the course of 2009, as planned, account balances of this business were reduced by USD 11.5 billion to USD 21.3 billion. During 2010, these balances are expected to be reduced by
a further USD 8.5 billion. In order to fund these outflows, assets from the institutional spread-based business have been transferred internally to other businesses in the United States in exchange for cash. As a result, the institutional
spread-based business realized a negative spread on these assets which adversely impacted underlying earnings.

 Dividend   AEGON’s dividend policy remains unchanged and is based on its capital position and cash flows. Although the capital position is strong, cash flows were impacted by higher than average impairments in
2009. Therefore, AEGON will not declare a dividend to common shareholders over the fiscal year 2009.  Manage AEGON as an international
company  At the end of the fourth quarter, AEGON launched a variable annuity product in the Netherlands, part of a broader effort to use
existing knowledge and expertise in the United States to expand the company’s variable annuities business in Europe and Japan. Currently, variable annuity products are being sold in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France. In addition,
toward the end of 2009, AEGON’s joint venture with Sony Life launched its first variable annuity product in the Japanese market. The product is being distributed through Sony Life’s Lifeplanner channel and several banks, including megabank
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. Sales will be reported starting in the first quarter of 2010.  New reporting structure  From the first quarter of 2010, AEGON will adjust its segment reporting structure to reflect recent structural changes in its organization. Comparable full
year 2008 and quarterly 2009 numbers will be published on April 12, 2010. The day after, on April 13, AEGON will host a meeting in London to provide a further explanation to analysts and investors.

   OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS       
 Underlying earnings before tax  AEGON’s underlying earnings before tax amounted to EUR 427 million for the fourth quarter. Financial markets had a positive effect particularly compared with the same quarter last year, when the
company’s earnings were severely impacted by the turmoil in world financial markets.  In the Americas, underlying earnings totaled
USD 446 million compared with a loss of USD 412 million a year earlier. The improvement was due mainly to the recovery in financial markets, which had a positive effect on both technical results and fee income. These more than offset lower
investment income as a result of increased cash balances in relation to the run-off of AEGON’s institutional spread-based business in the United States.  Underlying earnings in the Netherlands increased to EUR 95 million, up from EUR 75 million in the fourth quarter last year. This increase was mainly the result of improved technical
results including several provision releases. Investment income was lower, primarily because the fourth quarter of 2008 included substantial non-recurring dividend income.  In the United Kingdom, underlying earnings amounted to GBP 30 million, a sharp increase from the fourth quarter of 2008, as significantly higher fee income from improved equity and bond
markets offset lower earnings from life and protection and losses from distribution companies.  Underlying earnings from Other
Countries totaled EUR 42 million in the fourth quarter, driven mainly by further growth in Central & Eastern Europe and Spain. Earnings for the same quarter last year included a sizeable one-time charge in Taiwan. AEGON’s
Taiwanese life insurance operations were sold during 2009 and its results are no longer included in the company’s income statements. Excluding Taiwan, underlying earnings before tax increased 24%.  Expenses for the holding company amounted to EUR 48 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with EUR 17 million last year, primarily a
result of higher funding costs.  Fair value items  Fair value items include the over- or underperformance on certain assets held at fair value through profit or loss. In the fourth quarter, these showed an underperformance of EUR 174 million, a
significant improvement compared with an underperformance of EUR 770 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the Americas, the underperformance of EUR 103 million was primarily attributable to losses on a macro equity hedge and negative
revaluation of real estate related assets. Underperformance of fair value items in the Netherlands of EUR 43 million was due mainly to the impact of movements in the fair value of guarantees and related hedges. In addition, the further
narrowing of AEGON’s own credit spread resulted in a loss of EUR 26 million for the holding company.  Gains on investments 
 Gains on investments amounted to EUR 324 million in the fourth quarter, a result primarily of trading in AEGON’s bond portfolios. In
the Netherlands, investment gains were mainly the result of adjustments in the bond portfolio, in part driven by asset and liability management.  Impairment charges  Impairment charges decreased sharply compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 to EUR 209 million, the
lowest level in six quarters, though they remained above AEGON’s long-term average expectations. Impairments on US housing related assets totaled EUR 92 million, while the remainder was related mostly to hybrid securities issued by Irish
and UK banks.  Income tax  Income tax in the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 20 million and included a tax benefit of EUR 20 million related to cross border intercompany reinsurance transactions between Ireland and the United States. Tax gains related to
these internal transactions totaled EUR 419 million in 2009, and are a partial reversal of the EUR 490 million in tax charges incurred during 2008.  Net income  AEGON’s net income increased to EUR 393 million compared with a loss
in the fourth quarter of 2008. The improvement was the result of higher underlying earnings, as well as a significant improvement in the performance of fair value items, gains on investments, a sharp decline in the level of impairments and taxes.
 Commissions & expenses  Total commissions and expenses declined by 25% compared with Q4 2008 to EUR 1.4 billion, a result primarily of accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in the Americas in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to last
year’s lower equity markets. Operating expenses decreased by 11% to EUR 830 million as a result of significant cost savings and weakening of the US dollar.

 New life sales  New life sales totaled EUR 549 million, up 13% compared with the third quarter. Most businesses reported increased sales for the quarter. In the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, sales increased
primarily as a result of a rise in demand for AEGON’s pension products. In Spain and Asia, sales increased as AEGON’s businesses continued to expand, while in Central & Eastern Europe sales were unchanged from the third quarter.
 Deposits  Gross deposits,
excluding institutional guaranteed products, totaled EUR 5.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Pension deposits, saving deposits and variable annuities were all strong. However, as anticipated, fixed annuity deposits were lower, and will continue to be
managed toward a lower level. Net deposits, excluding institutional guaranteed products, remained strong at EUR 1.5 billion.  Value of new
business  Value of new business showed a substantial improvement across almost all countries compared with the third quarter and amounted
to EUR 216 million. In the Americas, the increase was due mainly to higher margins for variable annuities and life reinsurance, while in the Netherlands higher spreads on mortgages was the main driver. Higher sales volumes were the main reason for
an increase in value of new business in Spain.  Revenue-generating investments  Revenue-generating investments rose to EUR 361 billion at the end of December 2009, up 2% from the third quarter. The increase was mainly the result of a
further rise in equity markets and a stronger US dollar at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009.

Underlying earnings before tax increase to USD 446 million




   ¡
  
New life sales up 3% from previous quarter to USD 208 million




   ¡
  
Net deposits excluding IGP* total USD 1.4 billion, driven by strong pension sales




   ¡
  
Value of new business rises to USD 128 million as a result of higher margins Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax for the fourth quarter of
2009 amounted to USD 446 million.   







¡
  
Earnings from Life & Protection were strong in the fourth quarter and totaled USD 269 million.




   ¡
  
Individual Savings & Retirement earnings amounted to USD 136 million. Within variable annuities, a write-down of intangible assets related to the Merrill Lynch Life
company acquisition of USD 22 million was offset by a positive unlocking of deferred policy acquisition costs.




   ¡
  
Pensions & Asset Management earnings were in line with the same quarter last year as higher fees from higher asset balances were offset by increased employee benefit
plan expenses.




   ¡
  
Institutional guaranteed products spreads declined significantly due to an accumulation of cash necessary to run-off the business as well as the amortization of unrealized losses
on assets transferred to other portfolios in exchange for cash.




   ¡
  
Earnings from Life Reinsurance totaled USD 22 million. Net reserve strengthening was partly offset by favorable mortality experience during the quarter.
Net income  Net income amounted to USD
266 million, a strong improvement from the loss in Q4 2008. The improvement was the result of higher underlying earnings, the improved performance of fair value items, gains on investments and substantially lower impairment charges. 
The underperformance of fair value items of USD 143 million was attributable to macro equity hedge losses (USD 72 million), negative revaluations of
real estate related assets partly offset by strong private equity and hedge fund returns (USD 36 million), and fair value annuity losses (USD 35 million) driven by a tightening in credit spreads and policyholder behavior assumption changes.
 Gains on investments totaled USD 74 million, primarily the result of profits realized by trading in the bond portfolio.  Impairments, though still above AEGON’s long-term expectations, continued to trend down from the high levels experienced during the second half of
2008. During the fourth quarter, impairments amounted to USD 231 million.  Net income included a tax gain of USD 42 million related to
cross border intercompany reinsurance treaties. Tax gains from these internal transactions totaled USD 590 million in 2009 and are a partial reversal of tax charges of USD 718 million during 2008.  Commissions and expenses  Total commissions
and expenses decreased 21% to USD 1.1 billion. The fourth quarter last year included substantial accelerated deferred policy acquisition costs amortization following lower equity markets. Operating expenses increased 4% to USD 549 million as
significant expense reductions were more than offset by an increase in employee benefit plan expenses.  Sales and deposits 
Total new life sales increased 3% compared with Q3 2009. New premium production for accident and health products increased 3% compared with Q3 2009 as new
initiatives more than offset the run-off of the automotive credit business in the United States.  Total gross deposits, excluding IGP*,
increased 13% compared with Q3 2009. As a result of active management of the fixed annuity book, deposits declined to USD 648 million in Q4 2009, while variable annuity deposits continued to develop favorably and amounted to USD 965 million.
Mutual fund deposits increased by 18% to USD 862 million as a result of improved market conditions.  Pension deposits increased 22% in
the quarter to USD 3.3 billion. Net pension deposits remained very strong at USD 1.6 billion for the fourth quarter.

 Value of new business  Value of new business improved to USD 128 million due primarily to higher margins in the variable annuity and life reinsurance businesses. The internal rate of return increased to 14.7%, mainly as a
result of improved margins on variable annuities.  Revenue-generating investments  Revenue-generating investments declined by 1% in the fourth quarter to USD 307 billion at the end of December 2009 as outflows related to the run-off of the
institutional spread-based business were partly offset by strong net inflows from pension and retail businesses.  AMERICAS - EARNINGS

   ¡
  
Underlying earnings increase 27% to EUR 95 million




   ¡
  
Net income improves 65% to EUR 204 million




   ¡
  
Strong demand for pensions leads to new life sales of EUR 93 million




   ¡
  
Value of new business rises to EUR 66 million on higher margins and volumes Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax amounted to EUR 95 million.
Several separate provision releases totaling EUR 36 million more than offset charges of EUR 22 million related to a reorganization of the sales operations and EUR 9 million for the deposit guarantee scheme in the Netherlands following
the failures of two banks, Icesave and DSB.   







   ¡
  
Earnings from Life & Protection increased to EUR 62 million. Life results improved mainly as a result of higher investment income, higher earnings from mortgages and
lower costs, partly offset by charges related to a reorganization of the sales operations. Earnings also included several releases of provisions.




   ¡
  
For Savings, improved margins were more than offset by charges related to a reorganization of the sales operations and the failures of Icesave and DSB, which led to an underlying
loss of EUR 27 million.




   ¡
  
Pensions & Asset Management earnings declined compared with last year to EUR 53 million. Q4 2008 included a one-off dividend of EUR 75 million and exceptional
technical results of EUR 37 million. Current quarter results included a release of provisions.




   ¡
  
Earnings from Distribution amounted to EUR 1 million. Lower volumes in the Dutch insurance market continue to have repercussions for the earnings of this
business.




   ¡
  
General insurance earnings increased to EUR 8 million and included a charge related to the reorganization of the Dutch sales operations. Net income  Net income increased by
two-thirds compared with Q4 2008 to EUR 204 million. The improvement was a result of higher underlying earnings, lower impairment charges and increased gains on investments partly offset by an underperformance on fair value items. Gains on
investments totaled EUR 190 million, mainly the result of adjustments in the bond portfolio, in part driven by asset and liability management. Fair value items underperformed by EUR 43 million mainly because of the impact of fair value
movements of guarantees and related hedges. Impairments amounted to a positive EUR 7 million as a result of the recovery of previously impaired securities.  Commissions and expenses  Commissions and expenses decreased by 15% compared with Q4 2008
to EUR 321 million. As a result of significant cost savings, operating costs declined by 13% to EUR 258 million.  Sales and deposits 
 As a result of improved service and customer satisfaction, evidenced by recent surveys, demand for AEGON’s group pension products
increased. This resulted in pension sales of EUR 72 million. Meanwhile, life sales rose to EUR 21 million as a result of an increase in recurring premium production related to mortgages. In total, new life sales amounted to EUR 93 million.
 Value of new business  Higher volumes and margins in the mortgage business resulted in an increase in the value of new business to EUR 66 million. The internal rate of return for AEGON’s Dutch activities continues to be high at 14.9%, driven mainly by the
mortgage business.  Revenue-generating investments  Revenue-generating investments rose to EUR 70.9 billion at the end of December 2009, up 2% compared with the previous quarter, primarily the result of continued net inflows.

and expenses were up 8% compared with Q4 2008 to GBP 186 million, mainly as a result of a lower deferral of expenses and the release of employee benefit reserves in the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses decreased by 1%, as cost
savings measures led to lower expenses.  Sales and deposits  New life sales increased by 9% compared with Q3 2009 to GBP 237 million. Sales of group and individual pensions increased, though annuity production was lower, as planned following repricing. Gross
deposits declined to GBP 270 million, compared with a very strong third quarter.  Value of new business  Value of new business increased compared with Q3 2009, in line with higher pension sales, to GBP 32 million. The internal rate of return on new business
remained stable at 13.5%.  Revenue-generating investments  As a result of a further recovery in financial markets and net inflows, revenue-generating investments increased to GBP 55.8 billion at the end of December 2009.

   ¡

  
Underlying earnings before tax increase to EUR 42 million




   ¡

  
New life sales increase 39% to EUR 57 million compared with Q3 2009, primarily driven by higher sales in Spain




   ¡

  
Value of new business rises to EUR 30 million, due mainly to growth in sales Underlying earnings before tax  Underlying earnings before tax totaled EUR 42 million,
driven mainly by further growth in Central & Eastern Europe (CEE) and Spain. Earnings for the same quarter last year had included a sizeable one-off charge associated with the company’s Taiwanese operations. The sale of these
operations was completed in August 2009, and results are no longer included in AEGON’s earnings.   







   ¡
  
Earnings from Life & Protection increased to EUR 15 million, mainly as a result of growth in CEE – particularly in Slovakia and the Czech Republic – as well
as improved results from AEGON’s joint ventures in Spain. Results last year were impacted by an accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs in Taiwan of EUR 43 million.




   ¡
  
Individual Savings & Retirement earnings improved to EUR 4 million as AEGON’s Chinese asset management joint venture increased its asset balances on the back of a
strong recovery in the Chinese equity market.




   ¡
  
Earnings from Pensions & Asset Management rose to EUR 5 million as a result of higher asset balances and cost efficiencies in CEE.




   ¡
  
General Insurance earnings remained high at EUR 10 million, while the fourth quarter last year had included a reserve release of EUR 2 million. Net income  Net income from Other Countries
increased to EUR 18 million as a result of higher underlying earnings, lower losses on investments and lower impairments. Net income for the fourth quarter last year had included an equity impairment in Taiwan of EUR 45 million.  Commissions and expenses  Commissions and
expenses, excluding Taiwan, were unchanged compared with the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses, also excluding Taiwan, were also stable, despite continued growth in the business.  Sales and deposits  As a result of strong
growth in both single and recurring premium production, total new life sales increased 39% from the third quarter to EUR 57 million.   







   ¡
  
In Spain, new life sales increased to EUR 30 million as a result of the introduction of new products and successful sales campaigns. Sales for the partnership with regional
savings bank CAM, which are not consolidated in the company’s accounts, amounted to EUR 26 million on a 100% basis;




   ¡
  
In CEE, new life sales remained unchanged at EUR 21 million, while new premium production for non-life increased to EUR 14 million as a result of a greater focus on
sales of household insurance;




   ¡
  
In Asia, new life sales in China increased to EUR 6 million, as a result of higher recurring premium production in most distribution channels. AEGON’s joint venture in
India, which is not consolidated, recorded new life sales for the quarter of EUR 7 million on a 100% basis. Gross deposits
decreased compared with the third quarter to EUR 591 million primarily as a result of the introduction of new retail mutual funds in China resulted in high inflows during the third quarter.  Value of new business  Value of new
business increased 43% compared with the previous quarter to EUR 30 million, mainly as a result of improved sales in both Spain and Hungary. The internal rate of return remained at a high level.  Revenue-generating investments  Revenue-generating investments increased 6% during the quarter to EUR 12.3 billion at the end of December 2009. The increase was due mainly to market appreciation and net inflows.

 Notes:   


1)
 Certain assets held by AEGON Americas, AEGON The Netherlands and AEGON UK are carried at fair value, and managed on a total return basis, with no
offsetting changes in the valuation of related liabilities. These include assets such as hedge funds, private equities, real estate limited partnerships, convertible bonds and structured products. Underlying earnings exclude any over- or
underperformance compared to management’s long-term expected return on these assets. Based on current holdings and asset class returns, the long-term expected return on an annual basis is 8-10%, depending on the asset class, including cash
income and market value changes. The expected earnings from these asset classes are net of DPAC where applicable. In addition, certain products offered by AEGON Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a fair value basis, including the
segregated funds offered by AEGON Canada and the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities of AEGON USA. The earnings on these products are impacted by movements in equity markets and risk free interest rates. Short-term
developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings. Included in underlying earnings is a long-term expected return on these products, and any over- or underperformance compared to management’s expected return is
excluded from underlying earnings. The fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees of AEGON the Netherlands and Variable Annuities Europe (included in Other
countries) are excluded from underlying earnings. 


  
The Holding includes certain issued bonds that are held at fair value through profit or loss. The interest rate risk on these bonds is hedged using swaps. The change in
AEGON's credit spread resulted in a loss of EUR 26 mln in Q4 2009 on the fair value movement on these bonds. 


2)
 Net income refers to net income attributable to equity holders of AEGON N.V. 


3)
 New life sales is defined as new recurring premiums + 1/10 of single premiums. 


4)
 Deposits on and off balance sheet. In the previous quarters of 2009 gross saving deposits of AEGON The Netherlands were overstated by EUR
130 million, EUR 192 million and EUR 817 million in Q1, Q2 and Q3, respectively. Net deposits were not impacted. Comparative figures have been restated. 


5)
 Return on equity is calculated by dividing the net underlying earnings after cost of leverage by the average shareholders' equity excluding the
preferred shares and the revaluation reserve. 


6)
 Capital securities that are denominated in foreign currencies are, for purposes of calculating the capital base ratio, revalued to the period-end
exchange rate. 


7)
 All ratios exclude AEGON’s revaluation reserve. 


8)
 Included in other non-operating income/(charges) are charges made to policyholders with respect to income tax. 


9)
 There is an equal and opposite tax charge which is reported in the line Income tax attributable to policyholder return. 
Includes production on investment contracts without a discretionary participation feature of which the proceeds are not recognized as
revenues but are directly added to our investment contract liabilities. 


10)
 APE = recurring premium + 1/10 single premium. 


11)
 PVNBP: Present Value New Business Premium.   


a)
The calculation of the IGD (Insurance Group Directive) capital surplus and ratio are based on Solvency I capital requirements on IFRS for entities within the EU (Pillar
I for AEGON UK), and local regulatory solvency measurements for non-EU entities. Specifically, required capital for the life insurance companies in the US is calculated as two times the upper end of the Company Action Level range (200%) as
applied by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the US. The calculation of the IGD ratio excludes the available and required capital of the UK With-Profit funds. In the UK solvency surplus calculation the local regulator only
allows the available capital number of the With-Profits funds included in overall local available capital to be equal to the amount of With-Profits funds’ required capital. 


b)
The results in this release are unaudited.  Currencies  Income statement items: average rate 1 EUR = USD 1.4071 (2008: USD 1.4660)  Income statement items: average rate 1 EUR = GBP 0.8903 (2008: GBP 0.7961)  Balance sheet items: closing rate 1 EUR = USD 1.4406 (2008: USD 1.3917)  Balance sheet items:
closing rate 1 EUR = GBP 0.8881 (2008: GBP 0.9525)

 Cautionary note regarding non-GAAP measures  This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures: net operating earnings, operating earnings before tax, underlying earnings before tax, net
underlying earnings and value of new business. The reconciliation of underlying earnings before tax and operating earnings before tax to the most comparable IFRS measures is provided on pages 7 and 8. A reconciliation of (net) underlying earnings to
operating earnings before tax is provided on page 23. Value of new business is not based on IFRS, which are used to report AEGON’s quarterly statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for IFRS financial measures. AEGON believes that
these non-GAAP measures, together with the IFRS information, provide a meaningful measure for the investment community to evaluate AEGON’s business relative to the businesses of our peers.  Local currencies and constant currency exchange rates  This press release contains certain information about our results and financial condition in USD for the Americas and GBP for the United Kingdom, because those businesses operate and are managed primarily
in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about us
presented in EUR, which is the currency of our primary financial statements.  Forward-looking statements  The statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following are words that identify such forward-looking statements: aim, believe, estimate, target, intend, may, expect, anticipate, predict, project, counting on, plan, continue, want, forecast, goal, should,
would, is confident, will, and similar expressions as they relate to our company. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which merely reflect company expectations at the time of writing. Actual results may differ materially
from expectations conveyed in forward-looking statements due to changes caused by various risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following:
