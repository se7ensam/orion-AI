Forward-Looking Statements
Forward-Looking
Statements:
Certain
statements
made
in
this
announcement
may
include
“forward-looking 
statements”
within
the
meaning
of
Section
27A
of
the
Securities
Act
and
Section
21E
of
the
US
Securities
Exchange
Act
of
1934.
These
statements
may
be
identified
by
the
use
of
words
like
“anticipate,”
“believe,”
“estimate,”
“expect,”
“intend,”
“may,”
“plan,”
“forecast”,
“project,”
“will,”
“should,”
“seek,”
and
similar
expressions.
The
forward-looking
statements
reflect
our
current
views
and
assumptions
and
are
subject
to
risks
and
uncertainties. 
The
following
factors,
and
others
which
are
discussed
in
our
public
filings
and
submissions
with
the
U.S.
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission,
are
among
those
that
may
cause
actual
and
future
results
and
trends
to
differ
materially
from
our
forward-looking
statements:
our
ability
to
recover
costs
on
significant
projects;
the
general
economic
conditions
and
competition
in
the
markets
and
businesses
in
which
we
operate;
our
relationship
with
significant
clients;
the
outcome
of
legal
and
administrative
proceedings
or
governmental
enquiries;
uncertainties
inherent
in
operating
internationally;
the
timely
delivery
of
ships
on
order
and
the
timely
completion
of
ship
conversion
programmes;
the
impact
of
laws
and
regulations;
and
operating
hazards,
including
spills
and
environmental
damage.
Many
of
these
factors
are
beyond
our
ability
to
control
or
predict.
Given
these
factors,
you
should
not
place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

Revenue in line with 2009
an Adjusted EBITDA margin lower than 2009 outturn, namely lower 
than 22.1%
Emerging factors for consideration for 2010 margin:
Strength of the Q1 2010 results
Conventional activity in West Africa continued to strengthen
Strong contribution from our joint ventures expected 
Expectation of continued excellent execution
Pricing environment for shorter-term work in the UK North Sea remains 
very competitive
Impact of further delays in contract awards, beyond our current positive 
sentiment towards shorter-term work in UK North Sea or Conventional 
work in West Africa
2010 Guidance 


  


 

seabed-to-surface
April 14, 2010
slide 5
Stronger oil price and more stable macro environment inspiring 
greater confidence in industry
SURF market:
Increased tendering activity worldwide
Encouraged that certain major SURF contracts, delayed during 2009, are 
expected to come to market award
Given the size and complexity of these new major SURF projects –
offshore installation expected to commence beyond 2011
Pricing environment for shorter-term work, particularly in UK North Sea 
and Gulf of Mexico, remains very competitive
Conventional market in West Africa:
Continues to strengthen -
anticipate more activity at good margins
Expect to remain strong in short and medium-term
Acergy’s substantial local presence a competitive strength
Medium-term fundamentals remain strong

strong
Well placed to combine our competitive strengths of high calibre
engineering and project management skills, together with our high 
quality assets to capture future growth opportunities
Well positioned to capture growth opportunities

Adjusted
EBITDA:
The
Group
calculates
Adjusted
EBITDA
from
continuing
operations
(adjusted
earnings
before
interest,
income 
taxation,
depreciation
and
amortisation)
as
net
income
from
continuing
operations
plus
finance
costs,
other
gains
and
losses,
taxation, 
depreciation
and
amortisation
and
adjusted
to
exclude
investment
income
and
impairment
of
property,
plant
and
equipment
and 
intangibles.
Adjusted
EBITDA
margin
from
continuing
operations
is
defined
as
Adjusted
EBITDA
divided
by
revenue
from
continuing 
operations.
Management
believes
that
Adjusted
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
margin
from
continuing
operations
are
important 
indicators
of
our
operational
strength
and
the
performance
of
our
business.
Adjusted
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
margin
from 
continuing
operations
have
not
been
prepared
in
accordance
with
International
Financial
Reporting
Standards
(“IFRS”)
as
issued
by
the 
IASB
nor
as
adopted
for
use
in
the
European
Union.
These
non-IFRS
measures
provide
management
with
a
meaningful
comparison 
amongst
our
various
regions,
as
they
eliminate
the
effects
of
financing
and
depreciation.
Adjusted
EBITDA
margin
from
continuing 
operations
may
also
be
a
useful
ratio
to
compare
our
performance
to
our
competitors
and
is
widely
used
by
shareholders
and
analysts 
following
the
Group’s
performance.
However,
Adjusted
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
margin
from
continuing
operations
as
presented
by 
the
Group
may
not
be
comparable
to
similarly
titled
measures
reported
by
other
companies.
Such
supplementary
adjustments
to 
EBITDA
may
not
be
in
accordance
with
current
practices
or
the
rules
and
regulations
adopted
by
the
US
Securities
and
Exchange 
Commission
(the
“SEC”)
that
apply
to
reports
filed
under
the
Securities
Exchange
Act
of
1934.
Accordingly,
the
SEC
may
require
that 
Adjusted
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
margin
from
continuing
operations
be
presented
differently
in
filings
made
with
the
SEC
than
as 
presented
in
this
release,
or
not
be
presented
at
all.
Adjusted
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
margin
from
continuing
operations
are
not 
measures
determined
in
accordance
with
IFRS
and
should
not
be
considered
as
an
alternative
to,
or
more
meaningful
than,
net
income 
(as
determined
in
accordance
with
IFRS),
as
a
measure
of
the
Group’s
operating
results
or
cash
flows
from
operations
(as
determined
in 
accordance
with
IFRS)
or
as
a
measure
of
the
Group’s
liquidity.
The
reconciliation
of
the
Group’s
net
income
from
continuing
operations 
to
Adjusted
EBITDA
from
continuing
operations
is
included
in
this
release.
This
release
also
includes
a
supplemental
calculation
of 
Adjusted
EBITDA
from
continuing
operations
calculated
as
net
operating
income
from
continuing
operations,
plus
depreciation
and 
amortisation
and
impairment
charges
on
property,
plant
and
equipment
and
intangibles.
Management
believes
that
this
supplemental 
presentation
of
Adjusted
EBITDA
from
continuing
operations
is
also
useful
as
it
is
more
in
line
with
the
presentation
of
similarly
titled 
measures
by
companies
within
Acergy’s
peer
group
and
therefore
believes
it
to
be
a
helpful
calculation
for
those
evaluating
companies 
within
Acergy’s
industry.
Adjusted
EBITDA
for
discontinued
operations
is
calculated
as
per
methodology
outlined
above.
Adjusted 
EBITDA
for
total
operations
is
the
total
of
continuing
operations
and
discontinued
operations.
