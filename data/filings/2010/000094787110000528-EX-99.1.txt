      Advantest’s
business focuses on test systems for semiconductors, and relies heavily on the
capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, test houses and
foundries.  The capital expenditures of these companies are determined
primarily by factors such as current or future trends in the demand for
semiconductors. Amid the developing consensus that the global economy has
bottomed out, the semiconductor industry appears to be set for a period of
renewed expansion. Chip-makers are proactively ramping up capital expenditures
to support increased production volumes and enhanced productivity, producing
signs of improvement in Advantest’s business environment. However, it remains
difficult to predict whether the momentum of capital expenditures will be
sustained. In this environment, Advantest is unable to provide a detailed
forecast at this time. Therefore the earnings forecast for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2011 has not been presented. Advantest intends to promptly
disclose the relevant earnings forecast when such disclosure becomes
possible.

        Advantest’s
FY2009 (April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010) dawned with the global economy in
recession triggered by the financial crisis of late 2008. However, a mild
upswing has now taken hold worldwide, led by economic growth in China, India,
and other emerging nations, and underpinned by the stimulus measures adopted by
many national governments.
        In the
semiconductor industry, chip-makers were also impacted by the global downturn,
and restricted capital expenditures sharply at the beginning of the period. They
gradually resumed capital expenditures as chip prices rose and equipment
utilization rates climbed, driven by increasing demand for PCs, flat-screen TVs,
and cellular phones.
        Advantest
benefited from these positive market factors. Additionally, throughout the
period, the Company strove to improve profitability by cutting costs and
reducing fixed expenses through integration of manufacturing subsidiaries, while
expanding its sources of revenue by reorganizing its sales structure and
launching new products that adapt to customer needs. These measures enabled
Advantest to return to profitability in the fourth quarter of
FY2009.
        As a
result of the above, although sales for the period totaled only (Y) 53.2 billion
(a 30.6% decrease in comparison to FY2008), due to the drop in orders seen in
late FY2008, orders and earnings improved significantly year on year. Orders
input received was (Y) 67.7 billion (a 35.2% increase in comparison to FY2008).
Operating loss was (Y) 11.6 billion ((Y) 37.8 billion improvement in comparison
to FY2008). Loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated company
was (Y) 9.9 billion ((Y) 42.8 billion improvement in comparison to FY2008). Net
loss was (Y) 11.5 billion ((Y) 63.4 billion improvement in comparison to
FY2008). The percentage of net sales to overseas customers was 77.5%, compared
to 67.7% in FY2008.

        In the
Semiconductor and Component Test Systems segment, orders input received improved
significantly. Sales remained weak, due to the impact of weakened orders carried
over from the second half of FY2008.
        In the
memory sector, the Company was mired in an extremely challenging environment at
the beginning of the period, as memory makers continued to take a cautious
stance on capital expenditures. However, the upturn in PC shipments left
manufacturers struggling to keep up with demand, sparking fears of DRAM
shortages. Prices for DDR3-DRAM and other DRAM devices rose, encouraging memory
makers to resume capital expenditures, which led to a jump in orders for memory
test systems towards the end of the period.
        In
non-memory, orders for MPU test systems continued to be robust. Demand for LCD
driver IC test systems and consumer SoC test systems also expanded from the
second half of the period, as the global recovery stimulated demand for consumer
electronics including LCD TVs, cellular phones, and notebook
computers.
        As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 42.5 billion (a 62.7%
increase in comparison to FY2008), net sales were (Y) 32.6 billion (a 33.8%
decrease in comparison to FY2008) and operating loss was (Y) 7.0 billion ((Y)
21.9 billion improvement in comparison to FY2008).

        Demand
for Advantest’s test handlers also improved sharply during the second half of
FY2009, supported by increased activity in the DDR3-DRAM and analog IC markets.
However, the steep drop in orders in the second half of FY2008 kept sales at a
low level for the full year.
        As a
result of the above, orders input received was (Y) 14.8 billion (a 62.7%

      for the Upcoming Fiscal Year
                
              
        
        Amid the
developing consensus that the global economy has bottomed out, the semiconductor
industry appears to be set for a period of renewed expansion. Chip-makers are
proactively ramping up capital expenditures to support increased production
volumes and enhance productivity, producing signs of improvement in Advantest’s
business environment. However, it remains difficult to predict whether the
momentum of capital expenditures will be sustained. In this environment,
Advantest is unable to provide a detailed forecast at this time.
        With due
consideration of the above, Advantest continues to strive for improved
profitability through its corporate initiative “1000 Days,” launched in July
2009, by boosting the efficiency of its business processes and enriching its
pipeline of new products. The Company will also continue its push into new
markets, exemplified by the TAS7000, a 3D imaging and analysis system launched
in April 2010. Concurrently with these efforts, Advantest will focus on further
reinforcing its management structure. An additional merger of two manufacturing
and service subsidiaries scheduled for July 2010 will also enhance the Company’s
ability to deliver solutions characterized by Advantest’s best-in-class
technology and optimized for current market needs.

        Total
assets at the end of FY2009 was (Y) 188.7 billion, a decrease of (Y) 13.4
billion compared to the previous fiscal year, due primarily due to a decrease of
(Y) 14.6 billion and (Y) 9.0 billion in short-term investments and cash and cash
equivalents, respectively, and an increase of (Y) 6.9 billion and (Y) 5.5
billion in inventories and trade receivable,
respectively.  Stockholders’ equity was (Y) 150.2

decrease in short-term investments in the amount of (Y) 13.9 billion and
purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount of (Y) 2.8
billion.
        Net cash
used in financing activities was (Y) 1.8 billion (Net cash outflow (Y) 8.9

                  Basic
      Policy on Distribution of Profits and Distribution for FY2009 and
      Distribution Forecast for FY2010
                
              
        
        Based on
the premise that long-term and continued growth in corporate value is
fundamental to the creation of shareholder value, Advantest deems the consistent
distribution of profits to be the most important management
priority.  Accordingly, Advantest engages in active distribution of
profits based on consolidated business performance.
        With
respect to the distribution of retained earnings, Advantest makes payout
decisions after taking into consideration consolidated business performance,
financial conditions, as well as the need for strategic investment for
mid-to-long-term business development.  While aiming to make
consistent distributions, because of the fluctuation of the market in which it
operates, Advantest makes dividend payouts following a target payout ratio of
20% or more.
        Retained
earnings are devoted to research and development, streamlining efforts, overseas
expansion, investments in new businesses and resources for M&A activities,
with an aim to strengthen Advantest’s business position and enhance its
corporate value.
        In order
to maintain capital strategies responsive to changes in the operating
environment, Advantest will repurchase its own shares from time to time through
taking into account factors such as trends in stock price, capital efficiency
and cash flow.
        In this
fiscal year, Advantest decided, pursuant to the above profit distribution
policy, to distribute a year end dividend of (Y) 5 consistent with the revised
forecast announced on January 28, 2010, with a payment date of June 2, 2010.
Since Advantest paid an interim dividend of (Y) 5 on December 1, 2009, the total
dividend per share for the fiscal year will be (Y) 10.
        Advantest
has elected not to publish a dividend forecast for fiscal 2010 at this time, due
to the Company’s view that its results will take time to recover, despite the
improvement of the Company’s business environment, as explicated in the
prospects section above. Payout decisions will take future results into
consideration and will be announced when they are available.

        Advantest
has established a corporate vision of “Technology Support on the Leading Edge”,
and its corporate mission of “Quest for the Essence”.  Guided by these
principles, Advantest respects each of its stakeholders, strives to maintain
harmony with society, and aims for the sustained development of the Company and
the improvement of corporate value while contributing to the goal of a
sustainable society.

        Advantest
applies the “AVA” (Advantest Value Added), a financial index incorporating the
concept of EVA®(Economic
Value Added) *, as a significant management indicator, along with profit margin,
ROE and cash flows.  Specifically, Advantest will set the minimum
return-on-investment ratio (“hurdle rate”) for evaluating AVA at 8% and a
mid-term target at 12% or more with an aim to further enhance corporate value
and shareholder value.

                  Mid-and-Long-term
      Business Strategy and Issues to be
Addressed
                
              
        
        While
maintaining “Measurements” as our core competence in mid-and-long term,
Advantest intends to improve its corporate value by establishing a management
and financial structure that responds timely to changes in the global market,
and by aiming to increase market share by introducing fine products that will
inspire the market demands of the next generation.  To achieve these
objectives, Advantest promotes to further strengthen its product development
operations and improve production efficiency while strengthening its overseas
operations and support system in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
        As
semiconductor manufacturers relax their restrictions on capital expenditures,
Advantest is responding to signs of improvement in its business environment by
speeding up the implementation of its management strategy and seeking greater
business efficiencies. In the upcoming fiscal year, the Company will merge with
one of its manufacturing subsidiaries and one of its service subsidiaries, and
will review its R&D, manufacturing, sales, and service processes to further
align them with customer requirements, enhancing the Company’s ability to
respond actively to market shifts.
        Through
“1000 Days,” a corporate initiative launched in July 2009, Advantest will
continue to strive to reduce lead times, provide timely new solutions optimized
for market needs, explore new markets outside the semiconductor industry, and
pursue overall cost savings, as part of a concerted strategy to improve
profitability and swiftly return to financial health.

diluted net income per share but could potentially dilute net income per share
in future periods.

      　(Significant
subsequent event)
      The
Merger of Subsidiaries
      The
Company resolved at the meeting of its Board of Directors on April 27, 2010 to
merge its consolidated subsidiaries.
      1.
Purpose of the Merger
      The
subsidiaries to be merged are wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the
Company, which engage in manufacture and/or maintenance service of the Company’s
products. The Company will merge the subsidiaries, and review their R&D,
manufacturing, sales, and service processes to further align them with the
Company’s customer requirements, speeding up the implementation of its
management strategy and seeking greater business efficiency.
      2.
Overview of the Merger
      
        

              
                ①  
              
              
                Merger
      method
              
            
      
      Each
subsidiary will be merged into the Company as the surviving company and such
subsidiary will be dissolved.
      
        

              
                ②  
              
              
                Details
      of the allotment upon the Merger
              
            
      
      As the
Company owns all shares of each subsidiary, there will be no issuance of new
shares, increase of share capital or cash payment upon the merger for either
subsidiary.
