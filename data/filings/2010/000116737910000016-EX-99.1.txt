Shareholders
                        
                      
                
                
                  
                  
                    HUENENBERG, Switzerland – January 20,
2010 – The Independent Director Committee (the “Committee”) of Alcon, Inc. (NYSE:
ACL) today
announced that it formally responded to the January 4 proposal from Novartis AG
(“Novartis”) to attempt to acquire the minority publicly traded shares of Alcon
pursuant to a compulsory merger under Swiss law.  In its letter to Dr.
Daniel Vasella, Chairman and CEO of Novartis and an Alcon Board member, the
Committee stated that based on, among other things, advice from its independent
financial advisor, it had determined that the price and other terms proposed by
Novartis are grossly inadequate and that the financial analysis upon which
Novartis’ unilateral proposal is based is fundamentally flawed.
                    The
Committee also announced that the coercive tactics deployed by Novartis are
offensive and demonstrate a profound disrespect for Alcon’s minority
shareholders, many of whom are employees who, for more than 60 years, created
the value in Alcon.  The Novartis proposal would inequitably and
unfairly distribute that value to its two largest shareholders, which is neither
befitting a company of Novartis’ stature nor equitable to the Alcon
shareholders, many of whom have been long-term investors since the initial
public offering in 2002.  The Committee notes that Alcon employees are
one of the largest minority shareholders.
                    The
Committee reached this decision after a careful review of the terms and
financial aspects of Novartis’ proposal and analysis of information provided by
Alcon and its senior management team about the company’s past and anticipated
financial performance, growth prospects and merger synergy
opportunities.  The Committee worked closely with its independent
financial and legal advisors, Greenhill & Co., Sullivan & Cromwell LLP
and Pestalozzi, Zurich, in undertaking its analysis.
                    Novartis
proposed acquiring Alcon shares at a price of 2.8 shares of Novartis for each
share of Alcon through a compulsory merger transaction.  As of January
19, 2010, the proposal is valued at $151.43 per Alcon share due to the decline
in Novartis’ stock price, significantly below the $180 in cash that will be paid
by Novartis to acquire its majority position.

                          Thomas G.
Plaskett, Chairman of the Committee, said, “The Committee strongly believes that
the underlying historical record and Management’s expected future financial
performance of Alcon justify a significantly higher price than that reflected in
the current proposal by Novartis.  Moreover, minority shareholders
have rights accorded to them that must be respected.”
                          Plaskett
added, “We understand and are concerned that the current situation is
disconcerting to the highly valuable employee asset base at Alcon, many of whom
are shareholders, and we appreciate their continuing hard work and dedication as
we work through these issues at the Board level.”
                          The
Committee believes that the financial methodology used by Novartis intentionally
ignored Alcon’s documented market and operational performance, including Alcon’s
history of trading at a premium valuation compared to its peers.  The
market has consistently recognized and awarded Alcon a premium for its
attractive fundamentals, industry leadership and outperformance of quarterly
earnings expectations 26 out of 29 times since its 2002 IPO.
                          The
Committee also recognizes that the price offered to public shareholders is
substantially lower than that which will be paid to Nestlé for the controlling
stake, which is virtually unprecedented in the recent history of similar
transactions.
                          The
Committee also reiterates its disappointment with Novartis’ public implication
that Novartis can essentially force Alcon’s minority shareholders to accept the
terms of its proposal.  In fact, the Committee believes that Swiss law
and Alcon’s Organizational Regulations specifically protect minority rights by
requiring that a committee of independent directors approve a proposed merger
with a majority shareholder.  The Committee believes those rights were
reaffirmed and strengthened by Alcon’s full board of directors as recently as
December 2008 when, following Novartis’ initial purchase from Nestlé of an
approximately 25 percent stake in Alcon, the Alcon Board of Directors approved
the formation of a standing committee of independent directors whose stated
purpose is to protect the minority shareholders.  Dr. Vasella, the
Novartis representative on the Alcon Board, was a board member at the time and
approved the formation of the Committee.
                          Plaskett
continued, “Advocates of sound corporate governance and well-established
principles of fairness and equity in both Switzerland and the U.S. are rightly
offended by Novartis’ coercive attempts to take advantage of the Alcon minority
shareholders.  The Committee will evaluate and take all appropriate
and available steps to ensure that the rights of Alcon’s minority shareholders
are not trampled on in the manner proposed by Novartis.”
                          The
Committee also believes that Swiss law and Alcon’s organizational documents
require directors to recuse themselves from decisions on which they are
conflicted, which means that the non-independent Novartis-appointed directors
would be required to abstain from any Alcon Board decision as to whether or not
to approve Novartis’ merger proposal.  Likewise, conflicted directors
would also be required to abstain from voting with respect to the replacement of
any Committee members and any other action taken with the purpose of
circumventing the authority of the truly independent Committee members to accept
or reject the merger proposal.

                                            I am
writing to you on behalf of the Independent Director Committee (the “Committee”) of the
Alcon, Inc.  (“Alcon”) Board of
Directors in response to the January 4th proposal by Novartis AG (“Novartis”) to attempt
to squeeze-out Alcon’s minority shareholders in a compulsory merger in which
each Alcon share would be exchanged for 2.8 shares of Novartis stock (the “Novartis Merger
Proposal”), which is currently valued at approximately US$151.43 per
Alcon share in Novartis shares (as compared to the US$180 in cash that Novartis
has agreed to pay Nestlé AG (“Nestlé”)).
                                            
                                              Response to Novartis Merger
Proposal
                                              
                                                After
careful consideration with its independent financial and legal advisors, the
Committee has determined that the Novartis Merger Proposal is grossly
inadequate, that the analysis underlying the Novartis Merger Proposal is
fundamentally flawed and that the Novartis Merger Proposal is not in the best
interests of Alcon and its minority shareholders.  For these reasons,
as more fully explained below and in the attached “Summary of Financial
Analysis” exhibit, the Committee rejects the Novartis Merger
Proposal.

      Committee believes, based on the advice of its independent financial
      advisor, Greenhill & Co., that the fundamental value of Alcon on a
      standalone basis significantly exceeds the price that Novartis has

      flawed.

      described in the attached Summary of Financial Analysis, Novartis’
      “Methodology 1” applies price-to-earnings ratios across inconsistent time
      periods.  Correcting this misleading approach would produce a
      range of implied unaffected share prices that approximates the US$164.35

2009.

      “Methodology 2”  asserts that Alcon should trade in line with a
      number of broad healthcare stock indices, ignoring the fact that, since
      its IPO in 2002, Alcon has consistently outperformed every one of the 12
      indices that Novartis cited (both through April 4, 2008 and
      since).

      community in an attempt to demonstrate support for Novartis’ viewpoint,
      highlighting three analysts (of 12 who cover Alcon) who refer to an
      unaffected share price that approximates US$137.  While not all
      analysts covering Alcon comment on unaffected share price, seven of the
      eight analysts (including the three cited by Novartis) who express a view
      of the expected Novartis squeeze-out price cite prices of US$181 or
      greater.

      on input from Alcon’s management, the Committee believes that Novartis has
      understated achievable synergies in the transaction, by failing to
      quantify the significant revenue synergies that
      exist.  Additionally, Novartis has overstated its ability to
      realize cost synergies absent a full combination and Novartis does not
      accord the minority shareholders any synergy
      value.

      Committee disagrees with Novartis’ assertion that a 12% premium to the
      unaffected share price is “very much in line with what minority
      shareholders in similar transactions have
  received.”

      review of the approximately 250 squeeze-out transactions (of US$100
      million in size or greater) that were announced over the past decade shows
      that the final premium paid for the minority shares over the share price
      one week and one month prior to announcement were 27% and 30% on average,
      respectively, with median values of 18% and 21%,

      approximately 25% to the unaffected share price to squeeze-out the
      minority shareholders of Eon Labs, which also represented a premium of 9%
      to the price paid for the majority
stake.

      Alcon’s minority shares, the Committee notes the compulsory nature of
      Novartis’ proposal.

                                                                                    Due
      to the uncertainties in value inherent in using equity (as opposed to
      cash) as transaction currency, the Committee views Novartis’ proposal to
      exchange its shares for Alcon shares as inferior to the terms offered to
      Nestlé.
                                                                                  
                                                                                
                                                                          
                                                                          
                                                                            In
summary, the Committee, after careful consideration with its independent
financial advisor, has concluded that Novartis has dramatically understated
Alcon’s “unaffected share price” and that the premium that should be applied to
such share price is significantly higher than the 12% proposed by
Novartis.

Alcon Employees

employees are its greatest asset and it is only through their hard work and
unparalleled talent that Alcon became the successful company that you praised
when Novartis first acquired its stake in Alcon in April 2008 and again when
Novartis exercised its call option to acquire Nestlé’s remaining stake in Alcon
at a price of US$180 in cash per Alcon share.  These employees are
extremely loyal to, and are highly invested in, Alcon, collectively owning
millions of Alcon shares through various types of employee stock ownership
plans, making the Alcon employees one of the largest minority
shareholders.  These employees can observe that

proposal inequitably and unfairly distributes the value created by such
employees over time to Alcon’s two largest shareholders, at the expense of all
minority shareholders.

Director Committee

member of the Alcon Board of Directors that approved our Committee’s formation
and charter in December 2008, you are well aware that the Committee’s stated
purpose is to act as a disinterested body with respect to related party
transactions involving major shareholders of Alcon (such as Novartis) and to
protect the interests of Alcon and the minority shareholders of Alcon in this
type of transaction.
                                                                                          
                                                                                            Our
review and analysis over the past few weeks confirms the view expressed in the
Committee’s January 4th press release that the Novartis Merger Proposal amounts
to an attempt to circumvent the minority shareholder protections accorded by
Swiss law and embodied in Alcon’s Organizational Regulations.  After
further review with our legal advisors, the Committee has reached the
determination that Novartis cannot unilaterally
impose the terms of the Novartis Merger Proposal on the minority shareholders
without the approval of a disinterested body of directors.  By
operation of Article VIII of the Organizational Regulations and relevant
provisions of Swiss law, including Article 717 of the Code of Obligations, any
conflicted directors, which would include the non-independent directors
appointed by Novartis, would be required to abstain from voting with respect to
matters relating to the Novartis Merger Proposal.  This fundamental
protection was implemented to protect minority shareholders against potential
coercive actions that could be taken by controlling shareholders, and the
Committee is disappointed that Novartis appears to be attempting to flout such
protections so brazenly.
                                                                                            
                                                                                              You and
the Novartis management team appear to have publicly implied that Novartis will
simply replace the members of the Committee once Novartis consummates its
purchase of Nestlé’s remaining Alcon shares if we do not agree with Novartis’
assessment of the fairness of the Novartis Merger Proposal to the minority
shareholders.  Obviously, we do not believe that this strategy works,
and note that any attempted actions to effect it (such as replacing the members
of the Committee, changing the Committee’s composition or otherwise stripping
protections for the minority shareholders in the Organizational Regulations)
would result in the same conflict of interest noted above in respect of the
Novartis Merger Proposal and, as such, the conflicted directors would be
required to abstain from voting with respect to such actions.
                                                                                              
                                                                                                It is
important that you understand that the Committee’s response today is only the
first of potentially many steps that the Committee may take in the fulfillment
of its obligations to defend Alcon and the minority shareholders pursuant to
Alcon’s organizational documents and Swiss law.

response to the feedback and questions that we have received from myriad
shareholders, the Committee has prepared responses to Frequently Asked
Questions, which detail the legal hurdles that Novartis faces in any attempt to
unilaterally impose the terms of the Novartis Merger Proposal on the minority
shareholders, even after the point at which this becomes a “different game,” to

sure you will appreciate, the Committee has committed to make its views with
respect to the Novartis Merger Proposal known to all of the minority
shareholders, and is therefore including this letter in the materials that it is
making publicly available today.  We believe that it is in everyone’s
interests to resolve this matter in an expeditious and equitable
manner.

      Novartis calculates the 2010E price-to-earnings ratio as of April 2008
      (i.e. a 3-year forward multiple) and applies that same multiple to 2010E
      expected earnings today (i.e., a 1-year forward earnings estimate),
      ignoring
      the fact that nearly two years have passed since April 2008, and that
      3-year forward multiples are typically lower than 1-year forward multiples

      community in an attempt to demonstrate support for Novartis’ view,
      highlighting three analysts (of 12 who cover Alcon) who discussed an
      unaffected share price that approximates US$137, while ignoring these same
      analysts’ views of the appropriate price to be paid for the minority

      on input from Alcon’s management, the Committee believes that Novartis has
      understated achievable synergies in the transaction, by failing to
      quantify the significant revenue synergies that
      exist.  Additionally, Novartis has overstated its ability to
      realize cost synergies absent a full combination and Novartis does not
      accord the minority shareholders any synergy
      value.

      addition to the US$300 million of cost synergies cited by Novartis, the
      Committee believes that there is an even greater amount of revenue
      synergies, none of which appear to be reflected in the Novartis
      proposal.

      review of 247 squeeze-out transactions announced over the past decade with
      a value greater than US$100 million showed that the final premium paid for

      announcement were 27% and 30% on average, respectively, with median values
      of 18% and 21%, respectively.

      Novartis itself set a precedent in 2005 when they paid a premium of
      approximately 25% to the unaffected price to squeeze-out the minority
      shareholders of Eon Labs, which also represented a premium of 9% to the
      price they paid for their majority
