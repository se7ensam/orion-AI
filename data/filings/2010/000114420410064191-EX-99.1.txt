              Guidance
      for the year 2010 has been revised downward to revenues of $310 million
      and net income of $50 million due to lower-than-expected wind turbine
      sales.
            
          
      
    
     
    Mr.
Jinxiang Lu, A-Power's Chairman and CEO said, “A-Power’s results in the third
quarter were less than we hoped we would achieve. The shortfall was due mainly
to lower revenues in our Distributed power generation segment because of the
timing of work under contracts, and to less-than-planned sales in our Wind power
segment. Although Wind power achieved revenues of $15.5 million in the third
quarter, we had assumed we would be able to book revenues from a major customer,
Spinning Star LLC. However to date, Spinning Star has been unable to secure the
expected construction financing for its wind farm project in Texas.
    
    “We
believe our strategy to benefit from alternative power generation, in the forms
of distributed power, wind power, and photovoltaic solar power, continues to be
valid for the Company’s long-term success and is in the best interests of our
shareholders. Our design, engineering, suppliers, and operations are all in very
good shape and remain competitive in the marketplace.

    “Recently,
we have won a major new contract in our Distributed power business for the
engineering, procurement, and construction of four hydropower plants over a
period of six years, to be located in the Jilin province of China. The project
is expected to generate RMB 1.87 billion (about $279 million) over project’s
anticipated six year life.
    
    “We are
very aware of our responsibility to shareholders and are doing everything
possible to simultaneously expand our businesses and protect our assets in the
most prudent of ways.
     
    “We hope
to see greater predictability in financing for our customers in 2011 and the
years ahead.”
    
    Third
quarter 2010 financial results
    
    Revenues
in the 2010 third quarter decreased 40.7% or $39.3 million to $57.3 million in
the third quarter 2010 from $96.6 million in the third quarter 2009. The
decrease was primarily due to the decrease of $65.2 million in the Distributed
power segment, partly offset by an increase of $15.5 million in the Wind power
segment in the third quarter 2010 (the Wind power segment had no revenues in the
third quarter 2009), an increase of $9.6 million in the Other construction
segment, and revenue of $0.9 million in the newly established Solar power
segment. The lower revenues in Distributed power segment were mainly due to
fewer projects constructed in the third quarter of 2010 than the third quarter
of 2009. Please see our financial statement of segment information below for
more results by segment.
    
    Gross
profit in the third quarter decreased $0.3 million or 2.5% to $12.3 million in
the third quarter 2010 from $12.6 million in the third quarter 2009. The gross
profit margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenues, was 21.5% in the
third quarter, up from 13.1% in the third quarter of 2009. The improvement in
gross margin was due mainly to an increase in revenue in the Wind power segment
in the third quarter 2010, which had a gross margin during the quarter of
32.4%, compared with no revenue in the Wind power segment in the third quarter
of 2009.
    
    Selling,
general, and administrative expenses in the third quarter increased $5.6 million
or 172.2% to $8.9 million compared with $3.3 million in the third quarter 2009.
The increase was mainly due the acquisitions of Evatech Co. Ltd. ("Evatech") and
Hallys Corporation (“Hallys”) in 2010 that added $3.9 million in selling,
general, and administrative expenses in the third quarter 2010 ($2.7
million in excess of revenues from these subsidiaries), and due to higher costs
in the Distributed power and Wind power segments to further develop the
businesses, and higher costs in the Wind power segment associated with the
higher sales achieved. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general, and
administrative expenses were 15.5% in the third quarter 2010 compared with 3.4%
in the third quarter 2009.

    Operating
income was $3.4 million or 5.9% of revenues in the third quarter of 2010
compared with $9.4 million or 9.7% of revenues in the third quarter 2009. The
decreases were primarily due to higher selling, general, and administrative
expenses associated with the Evatech and Hallys operations acquired in 2010,
which, as noted above, were higher than revenues realized by them.
    
    Net loss
attributable to A-Power Energy Generation Systems, Ltd., increased $(0.4)
million or 66.7% to $(1.0) million, or $(0.02) per diluted common share, in the
third quarter 2010 from $(0.6) million, or $(0.02) per common diluted share, in
the third quarter 2009.
    
    Non-GAAP
net income, declined $7.5 million or 76.1% to $2.4 million in the third quarter
2010 from $9.9 million in the third quarter 2009.
    
    Weighted
average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis in the third quarter 2010
were 46.3 million shares, an increase of 34.0%, compared with 34.6 million
shares in the third quarter 2009.

    Recent
developments and updates
    
    Hydropower
engineering, procurement, and construction contract
    
    In
September, the Company signed a three-phase, six-year RMB 1.87 billion
(approximately $279 million) engineering, procurement, and construction contract
with Baishan Long Run Water Conservancy in Baishan city, Jilin province of
China. A-Power will be responsible for all the planning, engineering, and
construction within the hydropower stations, the building and repairing of
access roads to the facilities, and the construction of the power stations'
auxiliary projects, including office buildings, staff apartments, and hotels.
Phase one requires completion of a 12.8 megawatt water control project. Phase
two includes the design and construction of a 64 megawatt hydropower facility
over the Hun river. The third phase includes the design and construction of two
16 megawatt hydropower facilities over the Baijianghe river. The Company expects
to recognize revenues from this contract using the percentage of competition
method of accounting over the anticipated six years of the project’s
life.
    
    Reduction
of interest in Shenyang Power Group
    
    In
October 2010, the Company sold a portion of its shares of Shenyang Power Group
(“SPG”), representing 42.5% of SPG’s share capital, to three unaffiliated
purchasers, Liaoning Northern Electrical Energy Construction Limited, Liaoning
Northern Electrical Pipeline Construction Limited, and Liaoning Hi-tech Furnace
Construction Insulation Antisepsis Construction Limited.  The sale reduced
the Company’s ownership of SPG’s share capital from 62% to 19.5%. The
consideration for the sale consisted of the purchasers’ assumption of a total of
RMB 425 million (approximately $62.5 million) of the Company’s indebtedness to
SPG representing advances to the Company by Shenyang Power Group. The Company
did not receive any cash in the transaction.
    
    The
Company will furnish to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, under cover of a Form 6-K, unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial statements for the Company, giving effect to the sale of
42.5% of the share capital of SPG and reduction of the Company’s interest in SPG
to 19.5%.
    
    The
Company reduced its interest in SPG so as to surrender effective control of SPG
with a view to facilitating recognition of revenues attributable to projects in
which SPG invests. The sale has been completed and the Company is currently
taking care of the daily management of the operation. The Company will account
for its remaining investment in SPG using the equity method of accounting.
Additional information regarding the reduction in interest will be included in
the pro forma financial statements to be furnished by the
Company.

    Gearbox
joint venture with General Electric
    
    The
Company is conducting negotiations with GE (China) Co. Ltd ("GE China") to
acquire GE China's interest in GE Drivetrain Technologies (Shenyang) Co., Ltd.,
a joint venture between an affiliate of the Company and GE China formed in March
2009 to manufacture and distribute wind turbine gearboxes in China, and to
terminate the related gearbox supply agreement between an affiliate of the
Company and GE Transportation, a unit of the General Electric
Company.
    
    The
transactions with GE China and GE Transportation are subject to agreement on
mutually beneficial terms and execution of definitive documents, and there
can be no assurance that the transactions will be implemented. The Company will
issue an update about its discussions with GE China at an appropriate
time.
    
    Wind
power –
China
    
    As noted
above, the Company recognized revenues from the sale of four wind turbines to a
third-party purchaser in China during the third quarter 2010.
    
    Wind
power –
United States – Spinning Star
    
    To date,
the Company has not received a binding purchase order for turbines from Spinning
Star Energy LLC ("Spinning Star"), the joint venture enterprise owned
by United States Renewable Energy Group Wind Partners I, LLC (“USREG Wind”) and
SPG developing the proposed 615 megawatt Texas wind farm project (the
"Project"). Spinning Star has not been able to secure the debt or equity
financing that would allow it to make requisite payments to us under such a
purchase order. In addition, we have not reached agreement with Spinning Star as
to price and other commercial terms for the sale of turbines
(assuming Spinning Star otherwise had funds available to pay for
turbines).
    
    Spinning
Star has applied for a loan from the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE"), which
has approved Part I of such application.  Funding for the Project from the
DOE (which would be considered after submission of Part II of the application )
is not a certainty. The application process requires information that is not
presently available and involves a number of steps which may not be timely
achieved and securing funding is competitive in nature and at DOE’s
discretion.
    
      
         

      
      
         

        
          
        
      
      
         

      
    
     
    
      
          
            
              A-Power
      Energy Generation Systems, Ltd.
            
          
          
            
              44
      Jingxing North Street, Tiexi District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China 110021,
      telephone +86 24 8561 7888
            
          
          
            
                
            
          
      
    
    
    If
Spinning Star is unable to obtain funding from the DOE or from other public
or private financing sources for the Project, Spinning Star will not be able to
acquire our wind turbines, proceed with construction and commercial
operation of the Project, or obtain the benefits of U.S. Treasury Department tax
credits or tax credit cash grants that may be available for constructed U.S.
renewable energy generation projects.
    
    Under
Spinning Star’s organizational documents, if construction financing for the
Project has not been arranged by December 31, 2010, each member of Spinning Star
has the right to require the dissolution and liquidation of Spinning Star. In
our view, it is not likely that Spinning Star will be able to arrange the
requisite construction financing by December 31, 2010, in which event each of
USREG Wind and SPG would then accordingly have the right to elect to dissolve
Spinning Star, although neither party has expressed to us an intention to do
so.
    
    Wind power – other
U.S. opportunities
    
    We are in discussions with several different wind energy
project developers in the United States who have expressed interest in acquiring
turbines from us and jointly investing in wind project developments with us. As
of the date hereof, we do not however, have
any binding letters of intent or firm orders from any purchasers of turbines in
the United States.
    
    Other
developments
    
    In July,
we entered into a strategic partnership with Baoding Huide Wind Power
Engineering Co. Ltd., that will seek to align A-Power's brands, marketing
initiatives, and developing presence in the U.S. with the production and
technology of Baoding Huide's assets. Baoding Huide is a renewable energy
company primarily focused on the development, manufacture, and sales of 2.0
megawatt wind turbines and various design parts of wind power equipment in
China. 
     
    In July,
we renewed our license agreement with German wind technology company, Fuhrländer
AG, for the right to manufacture, sell, operate, and service 2.7 megawatt wind
turbines using Fuhrländer's F2500 technology throughout China.
    
    Effective
September 30, 2010, Mr. Morris Li, Ph.D., was named to the position of Vice
President of Solar Research and Development. Dr. Li will contribute to the
Company's proprietary photovoltaic cell production business and has more than 13
years of semiconductor industry experience.

    Business outlook and
guidance
     
    In light
of the general softness in the wind energy business and, in particular, the lack
of turbines purchases from Spinning Star and the consequent impact of these
factors on the near-term demand for A-Power’s wind turbines, the Company has
reduced its guidance for the full year 2010. It now expects revenues of $310
million (reduced from $500 million) and net income of $50 million (reduced from
$60 million).

able to successfully develop our business in new jurisdictional markets, which
would have a negative impact on the results of our operations derived from such
new jurisdictional markets; our customers may not be able to obtain the
