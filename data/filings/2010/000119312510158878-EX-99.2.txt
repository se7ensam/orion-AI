Forward-Looking Statements
Forward-Looking Statements:
Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking 
statements”
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities
Exchange  Act
of
1934.
These
statements
may
be
identified
by
the
use
of
words
like
“anticipate,”
“believe,”
“estimate,”
“expect,”
“intend,”
“may,”
“plan,”
“forecast”, “project,”
“will,”
“should,”
“seek,”
and similar expressions. The 
forward-looking
statements
reflect
our
current
views
and
assumptions
and
are
subject
to
risks
and
uncertainties. 
The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions
with the U.S. Securities  and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual
and future results and trends to differ materially  from our forward-looking
statements: actions by regulatory authorities or other third parties; unanticipated costs 
and difficulties related to the integration of Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7 Inc. and our ability
to achieve benefits  therefrom; unanticipated delays, costs and difficulties related to
the combination transaction, including satisfaction  of closing conditions; our ability
to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and 
competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with
significant clients; the  outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or
governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating  internationally; the timely
delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the 
impact
of
laws
and
regulations;
and
operating
hazards,
including
spills
and
environmental
damage.
Many
of
these 
factors are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Given these factors, you should
not place undue reliance on the  forward-looking statements.
This communication does not constitute an offer to purchase, sell, or exchange or the
solicitation of an offer to sell,  purchase, or exchange any securities of Subsea 7 or
Acergy.

slide 4
Medium-term
fundamentals
remain
strong
More stable oil price underpins confidence in our business
SURF market:
Continue to see strong tendering activity worldwide
Expect
some
of
the
delayed
major
SURF
contracts,
particularly
in
West
Africa and Australia, to proceed to market award this year
Given the size and complexity of these new major SURF projects –
offshore installation expected to commence beyond 2011
Conventional market in West Africa:
Expected to remain strong in short and medium-term
Acergy’s
substantial local presence a competitive strength
Expect to see further activity this year 


  




 

seabed-to-surface
July 14, 2010
slide 5
Short-term:
limited
visibility
in
the
North
Sea
and 
Gulf of Mexico
North Sea:
Visibility activity remains somewhat limited
Significant increase in tendering in H1 2010
Projects slow to come to award
Pricing environment for shorter-term work remains very competitive
Project awards expected to create margin headwind for 2010 and 2011 
Gulf of Mexico:
Tragic events raised questions in Industry
Anticipate that deepwater projects due to come to market award over 
next 12 months likely to be delayed until 2011 or possibly later
Acergy has very limited exposure to Gulf of Mexico
Do not anticipate direct impact on financial performance in short or 
medium-term 


  




 

seabed-to-surface

slide 6
Confident in the future
Continue to perform strongly and to deliver excellent execution for 
our clients
Order in take in the quarter relatively low, resulting in backlog falling 
to $2.3 billion, excluding joint ventures
Remain comfortable with the projects in the pipeline which should be 
awarded to the industry in remaining part of 2010, both in SURF and 
Conventional 


  




 

seabed-to-surface

Well
positioned
to
capture
opportunities
Continued, focused investment in people and assets
Confidence in the future demonstrated by ongoing fleet 
development:
Good progress continues on Acergy Borealis; work proceeding to plan; 
continue to discuss potential projects with clients
Post quarter end captured two investment opportunities:
Post quarter end, acquisition of Antares, new shallow water barge for use 
in the Conventional market for pipelay and hook-up projects in West 
Africa. Following modifications, expected to commence work on the Oso
contract, offshore Nigeria
Post quarter end, acquisition of Polar Queen, joined fleet in 2006 on long-
term charter. Following significant upgrade and customisation, she is one 
of the most advanced flexible pipelay and subsea construction vessels 
operating today

Summary
Remain confident in our performance and in the future
Guidance for fiscal year 2010 reiterated
For continuing operations:
Revenue in line with 2009
an Adjusted EBITDA margin lower than 2009 outturn, namely lower 
than 22.1% but close
Clear and focused strategy –
growth expected to be driven by global 
SURF market, driven by increasingly large and complex projects, 
while Conventional market in West Africa remains strong
Well placed to combine our competitive strengths of high calibre
engineering and project management skills, together with our high 
quality assets to capture future growth opportunities

Adjusted EBITDA
               
               The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs,
other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude
investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA 
margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from
continuing operations.  Management believes that  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the 
performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing
operations have not been prepared in  accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the European Union.  
These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our
various regions, as they eliminate the effects of  financing and depreciation. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to 
our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the Group’s
performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing
operations as presented by the Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other 
companies.  Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with
current practices or the rules and regulations  adopted by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from
continuing operations be presented differently in  filings made with the SEC than as
presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from 
continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be
considered as an alternative to, or more  meaningful than, net income (as determined in
accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s operating results or cash flows from 
operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s
liquidity.  The reconciliation of the Group’s net income  from continuing
operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this release.  This release also includes a 
supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net
operating income from continuing operations, plus  depreciation and amortisation and
impairment charges on property, plant and equipment and intangibles.  Management believes that this 
supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it
is more in line with the presentation of similarly  titled measures by companies within
Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies 
within Acergy’s industry.  Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated
as per methodology outlined above.  Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the
total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.
