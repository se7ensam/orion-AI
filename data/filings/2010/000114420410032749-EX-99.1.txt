    Mr.
Jinxiang Lu, A-Power's Chairman and CEO commented, "We are very excited with our
strong revenue growth and solid gross margin expansion in the first quarter.
Although the first quarter is typically a slow season in our DG activities in
most parts of China due to the winter weather condition, we set new records for
both revenue and net income growth in first quarter of 2010. Our geographic
diversification into southern China and international projects are contributing
more DG revenues. Our wind turbine business continues to gain traction and we
remain confident on the market outlook, as our larger turbines are receiving
favorable consideration in China, and the outlook for future turbine exports
also appears promising. With more components arriving and our production
expanding, we are continuing to move forward on all facets of our wind turbine
business, both domestically and internationally. On the financial side, we
continued to work to strengthen our balance sheet and manage our cash flow to
prepare ourselves for further expansion during 2010."
     
    First
Quarter 2010 Financial Results
     
    Revenues
in the 2010 first quarter increased 115.8% to $67.3 million from $31.2 million
in the first quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to continuing DG
contracts including $9.8 million in revenue from our DG project in
Vietnam.
     
    Gross
profit increased 248.4% to $9.8 million from $3.9 million in the same period of
2009. Gross margin was 14.5%, up from 12.6% in the same quarter of 2009. The
improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to higher sales and improved
operating efficiencies.
     
    Selling,
general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses amounted to $8.9 million
compared with $2.6 million in the previous year’s same quarter. The increase in
SG&A expenses was mainly due to the growth of the businesses and $2.8
million of SG&A expenses from Evatech Co. Ltd. (“Evatech”)which we
acquired in January 2010. As a percentage of revenues,
SG&A expenses increased to 13.2% for the first quarter of 2010 from 8.2% in
the first quarter of 2009.
     
    
      
        
        
      
      
        
        
        
          
        
      
      
        
        
      
    
     
    Operating
income was $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $1.4 million
in the same period of 2009. This reduction in operating income was attributable
principally to increased SG&A expenses, including $2.8 million of
Evatech-related operating expenses.
    
    During
the 2010 first quarter, the Company recorded a one-time gain of $13.6 million
from the investment in and acquisition of Evatech and a $14.2 million increase
in the fair value of outstanding warrants.
    
    GAAP net
income attributable to A-Power for the 2010 first
quarter was $29.3 million compared with net income of $1.6 million in the same
period of 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $0.64 compared with diluted
earnings per share $0.04 in the same quarter of 2009. In the 2010 first quarter,
total shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 45.7 million shares compared
with 34.7 million in the same period of 2009.
    
    Non-GAAP
net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $2.0 million, representing a 13.5%
year-over-year increase from $1.8 million at the end of March 2009. Non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share were $0.05, flat year-over-year, but based upon a
significantly greater number of diluted shares outstanding in the 2010
quarter.
     
    As of
March 31, 2010, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
totaling $220.4 million compared with $179.8 million at December 31, 2009.
Prepayments, deposits, other receivables from customers were $102.4 million
compared with $52.5 million at the end of 2009. Short-term loans outstanding, as
of March 31, 2010, were $69.1 million. Working capital increased by
approximately $18.0 million in the 2010 first quarter to $173.4 million. Total
stockholders' equity rose to $339.6 million at March 31, 2010 from $252.6
million at December 31, 2009.

    Safe
Harbor Statement
    
    This
press release may contain forward-looking statements. Any such statement is made
within the 'safe harbor' provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as “may”, "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future,"
"intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates," and other similar statements.
Statements that are not historical facts, including statements relating to
anticipated future earnings, margins, and other operating results, future
growth, construction plans and anticipated capacities, production schedules and
entry into expanded markets are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements, based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management,
are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to
differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including but not limited
to, the risk that: inclement weather conditions could adversely affect our
operating results in particular quarters and/or fiscal years; we may experience
construction, manufacturing and development delays on our projects which could
adversely affect our financial condition and operating results; our limited
operating history and recent entrance into new jurisdictional markets may make
it difficult for you to evaluate our business and future prospects; we may not
be able to successfully develop our business in new jurisdictional markets,
which would have a negative impact on the results of our operations derived from
such new jurisdictional markets; our customers may not be able to obtain the
financing required for these projects, and thus, we may not be able to derive
revenues from such agreements, as well as other relevant risks detailed in our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those set forth
in our annual report filed on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2009. The information set forth herein should be read in light of such risks. We
assume no obligation to update the information contained in this press release,
except as required under applicable law.
     
    Use
of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     
    To
supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we have presented
the non-GAAP measure indicated in the table and language in this press release,
which excludes certain business combination accounting entries and expenses
related to acquisitions, as well as expenses for stock-based compensations. We
believe both management and investors benefit from the ability to assess our
business operations and financial performance after elimination of the
non-recurring effects of the acquisition and other identified non-cash
activities and that our presentation of non-GAAP net income is useful for
understanding and assessing underlying business performance and operating
trends. Our presentation of non-GAAP net income is not meant to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP,
and should be read only in conjunction with the accompanying financial
information, which is derived from our consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP net income as presented herein may
not be comparable to any similar measures presented by other companies. Our
non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: 1)
Stock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based
compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income
measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our
employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned
during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the
generation of future period revenues such expense is not an indicator used by
management to measure the Company’s core operating results and business outlook.
2) Gain from acquisition: We have excluded the effect of Gain from acquisition
from our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. The gain from
acquisition is non-recurring and is not indicative of the Company's core
operating results. 3) Change in fair value of warrants: We have excluded the
effect of change in fair value of warrants from our non-GAAP operating expenses
and net income measures. The Company values the warrants quarterly and the
Change in fair value of warrants does not represent cash inflows or
outflows.
