   AEGON to enhance disclosure with new reporting
format  THE HAGUE – As previously announced, AEGON will introduce a new reporting format that better aligns with the way AEGON
manages its businesses, beginning on May 12 when the company announces its financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Today’s announcement is intended to provide an explanation of the new reporting format and prepare financial
analysts and media with the key changes to ensure proper comparison of 2010 first quarter results with previous quarters.  Going forward,
AEGON will report its underlying earnings primarily on the following segments:   


 
•
 
 Americas   


 
•
 
 The Netherlands   


 
•
 
 United Kingdom   


 
•
 
 New markets  AEGON will
continue to provide details of underlying earnings by lines of business. “Underlying earnings” changed based on the new reporting format, however, net income remains unchanged. 
AEGON CFO Jan Nooitgedagt stated: “In recent months, we have implemented a number of significant reorganizational changes within AEGON’s
businesses, particularly in our operations in the Americas. In doing so, we recognized the need to enhance our reporting and ensure that it reflects the way we manage our business. As part of this process, we have also evaluated our disclosures and
eliminated elements which are redundant or not particularly useful with the aim of providing the most relevant measurements for the progress of our business.” 
In anticipation of AEGON’s first quarter 2010 results on May 12, AEGON is providing its full-year 2008 and quarterly 2009 earnings and sales
numbers according to the new format to facilitate comparison. Tomorrow, at 4.30 p.m. CET, Mr. Nooitgedagt will host a briefing in London to provide a further explanation of the changes to analysts and investors. Mr. Nooitgedagt’s
presentation will be available at 8 a.m. CET on April 13 on the corporate website. The meeting will also be broadcast live via AEGON’s website: www.aegon.com. 
AEGON’s new reporting structure will also include a number of other changes: 
 


 
•
 
 The use of “operating earnings” will be discontinued to further simplify AEGON’s reporting and to focus on the key performance
indicator, “underlying earnings.” 


 
•
 
 “Run-off businesses”, mainly consisting of US institutional spread-based business, will be reported in a separate line.
  


 
•
 
 Earnings from AEGON Asset Management will also be reported separately within “New markets” as of Q1 2010. 
 


 
•
 
 “Earnings from associates” will be reported on an underlying earnings basis and sales from associates will be reported proportionately as
well.

 GLOSSARY 
These descriptions are intended to provide general guidance, but are not exhaustive and are subject to change. 
OPERATING SEGMENTS  Americas
 Covers business units operating in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, including any of the units’ activities located
outside these countries.  The Netherlands 
Covers businesses operating in the Netherlands. 
United Kingdom  Covers businesses
operating in the United Kingdom.  New markets 
Covers businesses operating in Central & Eastern Europe, Asia, Spain and France as well as AEGON’s variable annuity activities in Europe and
AEGON Asset Management.  ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM UNDERLYING EARNINGS 
Fair value items  Fair value items
include the ‘over’ or ‘under’ performance of investments and guarantees held at fair value for which the expected long-term return is included in underlying earnings, the gains (losses) on real estate and hedge ineffectiveness.
 Certain assets held are carried at fair value, and managed on a total return basis, with no offsetting changes in the valuation of related
liabilities. These include assets such as hedge funds, private equities, real estate limited partnerships, convertible bonds and structured products. Underlying earnings exclude any over- or underperformance compared to management’s long-term
expected return on these assets. Based on current holdings and asset class returns, the long-term expected return on an annual basis is 8-10%, depending on the asset class, including cash income and market value changes. The expected earnings from
these asset classes are net of DPAC where applicable.  In addition, certain products offered in the Americas contain guarantees and are
reported on a fair value basis, including the segregated funds offered in Canada and the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities in the United States. The earnings on these products are impacted by movements in equity markets and
risk free interest rates. Short-term developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings. Included in underlying earnings is a long-term expected return on these products, and any over- or underperformance compared to
management’s expected return is excluded from underlying earnings. The fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees in the Netherlands and Variable Annuities
Europe (included in New market) are excluded from underlying earnings.  Realized gains or losses on investments 
Includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, as well as mortgage and loan portfolios. 
Impairment charges  Impairments
(reversals) on available-for-sale shares and bonds, including the effect of deferred policyholder acquisition costs and mortgage and loan portfolios on amortized costs and associates.
