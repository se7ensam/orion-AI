    MANAGEMENT'S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
    
    Alcon, Inc.'s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting.  Alcon, Inc.'s internal control system was designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of
its published consolidated financial statements.
    
    All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
    
    Alcon, Inc.'s management assessed the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria
established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this
assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, Alcon,
Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria.

    REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
    
    To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of
    Alcon,
Inc.:
    
    We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alcon, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2009.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
    
    We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
    
    In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Alcon, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
    
    We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Alcon, Inc.'s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 15, 2010 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

    REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
    
    To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of
    Alcon,
Inc.:
    
    We have
audited Alcon, Inc.'s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).  Alcon, Inc.'s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
    
    We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
    
    A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
    
    Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
    
    In our
opinion, Alcon, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
    
    We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Alcon, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009,
and our report dated March 15, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

              Summary
      of Significant Accounting Policies and
Practices
            
          
    
    
    
      

            
              (a)  
            
            
              Description
      of Business
            
          
    
    
    Alcon,
Inc. ("Alcon"), a Swiss corporation, is a majority owned subsidiary of Nestlé
S.A. ("Nestlé").  During July 2008, Nestlé sold approximately 74
million of its Alcon common shares to Novartis AG.  At December 31,
2009, Nestlé owned 156,076,263 common shares of Alcon. In January 2010, Novartis
exercised its call option for Nestlé's remaining Alcon common shares and
proposed a merger of Alcon with and into Novartis, as discussed in note
17.
    
    The
principal business of Alcon and all of its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") is the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals,
surgical equipment and devices, contact lens care and other vision care products
that treat eye diseases and disorders and promote the general health and
function of the human eye.  Due to the nature of the Company's
worldwide operations, it is not subject to significant concentration
risks.
    
    
      

            
              (b)  
            
            
              Principles
      of Consolidation
            
          
    
    
    The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company.  All significant balances and transactions among the
consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation.  All
consolidated entities are included on the basis of a calendar year.
    
    
      

            
              (c)
            
            
              Management
      Estimates
            
          
    
    
    Management
of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the
reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP").  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
    
    (d)   Foreign
Currency
    
    The
reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar.  The
financial position and results of operations of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries are generally determined using the local currency as the functional
currency.  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries have been
translated at the rate of exchange at the end of each
period.  Revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted
average rate of exchange in effect during the period.  Gains and
losses resulting from translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.  The impact of
subsidiaries located in countries whose economies are considered highly
inflationary is insignificant.  Gains and losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in nonoperating
earnings.  Under Swiss corporate law, Alcon is required to declare any
dividends on its common shares in Swiss francs.
    
    (e)   Cash
and Cash Equivalents
    
    Cash
equivalents include demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less.
    
    (f)    Inventories
    
    Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined
primarily using the first-in, first-out method.
    
    
      
         

      
      
        12
         

      
      
         

      
    
    (g)   Investments
    
    
      

            
               
      
            
            
              The
      Company holds investments of various types, maturities and
      classifications.
            
          
    
    
    Trading
Securities.  Trading securities are stated at fair value, with
gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in
earnings.  Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these
securities are included in the consolidated statements of earnings in other,
net.
    
    Available-for-Sale
Investments.  Investments designated as available-for-sale
include marketable debt and equity securities.  Investments designated
as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholders' equity.  The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification
method.  Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are
recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings in other,
net.  Should the decline in value of any investment be deemed to be
other-than-temporary, the investment basis is written down to fair value and the
write-down is recorded to earnings as a loss in other, net.
    
    
      

            
               
      
            
            
              Held-to-Maturity
      Investments.  The Company holds no investments classified
      as held-to-maturity.
            
          
    
    
    Short Term/Long Term
Classification.  The Company considers all liquid
interest-earning investments with original maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.  Debt securities with maturities greater than
three months and less than one year are classified as short term
investments.  Generally, debt securities with remaining maturities
greater than one year are classified as long term
investments.  However, investments with maturities greater than one
year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and
because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations.
    
    (h)   Financial
Instruments
    
    The
Company uses various derivative financial instruments on a limited basis as part
of a strategy to manage the Company's exposure to certain market risks
associated with interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
expected to occur within the next twelve months.  The Company
evaluates the use of interest rate swaps and periodically uses such arrangements
to manage its interest risk on selected debt instruments.
    
    The
Company regularly uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the
effect of exchange rate changes on certain foreign currency denominated
intercompany and third-party transactions.  The forward exchange
contracts establish the exchange rates at which the Company purchases or sells
the contracted amount of foreign currencies for specified local currencies at a
future date.  The Company uses forward contracts, which are short term
in nature, and receives or pays the difference between the contracted forward
rate and the exchange rate at the settlement date.
    
    All of
the Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair
value.  For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as fair
value hedges, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded immediately in
earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities
being hedged.  For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as
cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders' equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transaction affects earnings.
    
    (i)   
Property, Plant and Equipment
    
    Property,
plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.  Additions, major
renewals and improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs
are expensed.  Upon disposition, the book value of assets and related
accumulated depreciation is relieved and the resulting gains or losses are
reflected in earnings.
    
    
      
         

      
      
        13
         

      
      
         

      
    
    Depreciation
on plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
    
    
      

            
              Land
      improvements

      and
      improvements                                                                                                          
            
            
              12-50
      years
            
          
            
              Machinery,
      other equipment and
      software                                                                                                          
            
            
              3-12
      years
            
          
    
    
    (j)    Goodwill
and Intangible Assets, Net
    
    Goodwill
is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least
annually.  Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives to their residual values and
reviewed for recoverability upon the occurrence of an event that might indicate
conditions for impairment could exist.
    
    Intangible
assets, net, include acquired customer base, trademarks, patents and licensed
technology.  The cost of these intangible assets is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
which are 4 to 20 years.
    
    Intangible
assets, net, also include the costs of purchased in process research and
development projects.  The costs of these projects are not amortized
but are tested for impairment at least annually and the projects are monitored
to determine if commercialization has been achieved.  If these
projects reach commercialization, the related costs will be amortized over the
useful lives of the respective assets.
    
    (k)   Impairment
    
    Long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
    
    (l)    Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans
    
    The
Company sponsors several defined contribution plans, defined benefit retirement
plans and a postretirement healthcare plan.
    
    The
Company provides for the benefits payable to employees on retirement by charging
current service costs to income systematically over the expected service lives
of employees who participate in defined benefit plans.  An actuarially
computed amount is determined at the beginning of each year by using valuation
methods that attribute the cost of the retirement benefits to periods of
employee service.  Such valuation methods incorporate assumptions
concerning employees' projected compensation and healthcare cost
trends.  Prior service costs for plan amendments are generally charged
to income systematically over the remaining expected service lives of
participating employees.
    
    The
overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans (other
than multiemployer plans) is shown as an asset or liability in the balance sheet
and changes in the funded status are recognized in the year in which the changes
occur through other comprehensive income.  Effective January 1, 2008,
the Company adopted a provision to measure the funded status of a plan as of the
date of its year-end balance sheet.  The Company utilized the
alternate transition method to transition the measurement date for its defined
pension benefit plan in Japan from September 30 to December 31.  Under
this transition method, the Company charged 3/15ths of the estimated pension
cost from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 (or $1, net of taxes) to retained
earnings as of January 1, 2008.  Retrospective application was not
permitted.
    
    The cost
recognized for defined contribution plans is based upon the contribution
required for the period.

    (m)  Revenue
Recognition
    
    The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104.
    
    The
Company recognizes revenue on product sales when the customer takes title and
assumes risk of loss except for surgical equipment sales.  If the
customer takes title and assumes risk of loss upon shipment, revenue is
recognized on the shipment date.  If the customer takes title and
assumes risk of loss upon delivery, revenue is recognized on the delivery
date.  Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after
deducting estimated amounts for rebates and product returns.
    
    The
Company recognizes revenue on surgical equipment sales when the customer takes
title and assumes risk of loss and when installation and any required training
have been completed.  Per procedure technology fees related to LADARVision®
refractive laser systems are recognized in the period when the procedure is
performed.  Per procedure technology fees associated with treatment
cards related to refractive products manufactured by WaveLight AG are recognized
when the treatment cards are delivered and title and risks of ownership are
transferred.
    
    When the
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products, certain items, such as
cash discounts, allowances and rebates, which are known and estimable at the
time of sale, are recorded as a reduction of sales.  To the extent the
customer will, or is expected to, reduce its payment on the related invoice
amounts, these items are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable and
sales.
    
    In
accordance with certain government rebate requirements (such as those under U.S.
Medicaid and Medicare) and with certain contractual agreements, the Company is
required to pay rebates to customers, their customers or government agencies
under provisions that limit the amounts that may be paid for pharmaceuticals and
surgical devices.  The amount of accrued product rebates is included
in other current liabilities.
    
    The
Company records a reduction of sales for estimated discounts, allowances and
rebates in the period in which the related sales occur, based upon historical
experience of amounts paid and amounts as a percentage of sales.  The
Company also considers the effects of changes in product pricing, in sales
trends, in contract terms and in laws and regulations.
    
    Value
added taxes and other sales taxes are excluded from sales.
    
    (n)   Research
and Development
    
    Internal
research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Third-party
research and development costs are expensed as the contracted work is performed
or as milestone results have been achieved.
    
    (o)   Selling,
General and Administrative
    
    Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $129, $144 and
$143 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    
    Shipping
and handling costs amounted to $70, $76 and $66 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
    
    Legal
costs are expensed during the period incurred.
    
    (p)   Income
Taxes
    
    The
Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary
differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Company's assets, liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing

    operating
loss and credit carryforwards.  The impact on deferred income taxes of
changes in tax rates and laws, if any, are applied to the years during which
temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected in the financial
statements in the period of enactment.  Withholding taxes have been
provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries which are not reinvested
indefinitely in such operations.  Taxes have not been provided on
permanent investments in certain subsidiaries that would be taxable in the event
of liquidation.  Dividends paid by subsidiaries to Alcon, Inc. do not
result in Swiss income taxes.
    
    (q)   Basic
and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share
    
    Basic
earnings per common share were computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the relevant
period.  The unvested portion of restricted common shares was excluded
in the calculation of basic weighted average common shares
outstanding.  Diluted weighted average common shares reflect the
potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, that could occur if
employee stock options for the purchase of common shares and share-settled stock
appreciation rights were exercised and if share-settled restricted share units
and performance share units and contingent restricted common shares granted to
employees were vested.
    
    The
following table reconciles the weighted average shares of the basic and diluted
share computations:

    Certain
executives of the Company had deferred the receipt of 118,180 and 146,883 Alcon
common shares at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, into the Alcon
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan discussed in note 14.  Alcon
common shares held in the plan were reflected as outstanding in the consolidated
balance sheets and were included in the applicable basic and diluted earnings
per share calculations.
    
    The
computations of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 did not include the following
instruments, as their exercise prices and unrecognized costs were greater than
the average market price of the common shares:

    (r)   Comprehensive
Income
    
    Comprehensive
income consists of net earnings, foreign currency translation adjustments,
unrealized gains (losses) on investments and the changes in the funded status of
defined benefit postretirement plans and is presented in the consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income.

    (s)   Share-Based
Compensation
    
    U.S. GAAP
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, based on estimated
"fair values."
    
    The Company estimates the "fair value"
of share-based payment awards as of the date of grant using an option-pricing
model.  The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period.  Share-based compensation expenses
recognized in net earnings were based on awards ultimately expected to vest, and
therefore the amounts were reduced for estimated forfeitures.  The
Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ materially from those
estimates.  Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation
are reflected as financing cash flows rather than operating cash
flows.
    
    The Company records deferred tax assets
for share-based awards that result in deductions on the Company's income tax
returns, based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the Company's
statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it expects to receive a
deduction.  Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for
financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the
Company's income tax return are recorded in additional paid-in capital (if the
tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset) or in the consolidated statement
of earnings (if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no
additional paid-in capital exists from previous awards).
    
    (t)    Treasury
Shares
    
    Treasury
shares are accounted for by the cost method.  The board of directors
has approved the purchase of Alcon common shares for various purposes as
described in notes 13 and 17.
    
    (u)   Warranty
Reserves
    
    The
Company generally warrants its surgical equipment against defects for a period
of one year from the installation date.  Warranty costs are estimated
and expensed at the date of sale and the resulting accrued liability is
amortized over the warranty period.  Such costs are estimated based on
actual cost experience.
    
    (v)   Reclassifications
    
    In note
11, certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform with
current year presentation.  These reclassifications had no effect on
reported earnings, working capital or shareholders' equity.

              During
      the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, certain individuals
      terminated employment prior to the vesting of their restricted Alcon
      common shares and forfeited 5,420 shares, 17,622 shares and 18,969 shares,
      respectively.  (See note 13 for discussion of restricted common
      shares.)  The forfeited shares were recorded as treasury shares
      during the respective periods.

              During
      the year ended December 31, 2009, 1,085 treasury shares, representing
      previously declared dividends applicable to common shares withdrawn from
      the Alcon Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, were delivered to plan
      participants.  No such shares were delivered in 2008 and
      2007.

    A
revision to the Financial Instruments Topic 825-10-45 in the Accounting
Standards Codification ("ASC") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") became effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and
generally does not permit retrospective application.  This revision
directs entities to classify cash receipts and cash payments related to items
measured at fair value according to their nature and purpose.  As a
result, cash receipts and payments related to trading securities, which were
reported in net cash from operating activities in 2007, were reported in cash
flows from investing activities in 2009 and 2008 and cash flows for 2009 and
2008 are not directly comparable to those reported in 2007.  Cash
payments and receipts related to available-for-sale securities have been
included in cash flows from investing activities in 2009, 2008 and
2007.

    Foreign Currency Risk
Management
    
    A
significant portion of the Company's cash flows is denominated in foreign
currencies.  Alcon relies on ongoing cash flows generated from foreign
sources to support its long term commitments to U.S. dollar-based research and
development.  To the extent the dollar value of cash flows is
diminished as a result of weakening local currencies relative to the dollar, the
Company's ability to fund research and other dollar-based strategic initiatives
at a consistent level may be impaired.  The Company has established a
foreign currency risk management program to protect against volatility of
non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and changes in fair
value caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
    
    The
Company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts in countries where they
are available and economically beneficial to offset the impact of fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and their related cash
flows.  All outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts are entered
into to protect the value of assets or liabilities denominated in currencies
other than the entity's functional currency.  To the extent hedged,
the changes in fair value of the forward contracts offset the changes in the
value of the assets or liabilities.  The changes in value of the
foreign exchange forward contracts and the assets/liabilities that are being
protected are recorded in foreign exchange gains and losses within other income
(expense).
    
    The fair
values of forward exchange and option contracts are reported in other current
assets and other current liabilities.  At December 31, 2009, the fair
value hedge derivative instruments have settlement dates in the first half of
2010 and cover a gross notional amount of $521.
    
    The
Company believes that, at the balance sheet date, counterparty credit risk was
not significant due to the credit quality of the counterparties to the
derivatives, which were all large financial institutions in Switzerland, and the
short-term maturities of most derivatives.  The credit exposure
related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of
contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date.
    
    For the year ended December 31, 2009,
the effects of foreign exchange derivative instruments were:

    Interest Rate Risk
Management
    
    The
Company may use interest rate swaps on certain investing and borrowing
transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce
its overall cost of borrowing.  The Company does not use leveraged
swaps and does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put
capital at risk.
    
    At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, in connection with a long term bank loan, the
Company had an interest rate swap fair value hedge outstanding in the notional
principal amount of $54 and $55 at the respective year-end exchange
rates.  The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are reported
in other current assets and other current liabilities.  This interest
rate swap did not have a significant effect on results of operations in 2009 and
2008.
    
    Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
    
    At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company's financial instruments included cash
and cash equivalents, investments, trade receivables, accounts payable, short
term borrowings, long term debt and the estimated fair value of certain
contingent payments.  The estimated fair value of all of these
financial instruments is as noted below.  Due to the short term
maturities of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable and
short term borrowings, the carrying amount approximates fair
value.  The fair value of long term debt was based on interest rates
then currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms
and remaining maturities.  The fair values of investments and
acquisition-related contingent payments were determined as discussed
below.

    Financial instruments, such as equity
or fixed income securities, other investments, financial liabilities and
derivatives, are presented at fair value.  Fair value is defined as
the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability could be
transferred in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable and willing market
participants within the principal or most advantageous market at the measurement
date.  Where available, fair value is based on or derived from
observable market prices or parameters.  Where observable prices or
inputs are not available, pricing for similar financial assets or liabilities,
dealer quotes or valuation models are applied.  These valuation
techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree
of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market
and the instruments' complexity.
    
    Financial
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets
were categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs
used to measure their fair value.  These categories, from lowest to
highest based on the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair
valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:
    
    Level 1 –
Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities at the measurement date.
     
    
      
         

      
      
        25
         

      
      
         

      
    
     
    The types
of Company assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equities listed in active
markets.
    
    Level 2 –
Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or
indirectly observable for the assets or liabilities through correlation with
market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's
anticipated life.
    
    The
Company's assets generally included in this fair value category are various
government agency securities, certain investment funds, mortgage backed
securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, foreign exchange derivatives
and certain interest rate derivatives.  Foreign exchange derivatives
and interest rate derivatives are valued using corroborated, observable market
data.  The Company's liabilities generally included in this fair value
category consist of certain foreign exchange derivatives.
    
    Level 3 –
Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  These
inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement
date.  Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation
technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
    
    Generally,
the Company's assets carried at fair value included in this category are various
investment funds.
    
    The
Company's liabilities carried at fair value in this category are
acquisition-related contingent payments.
    
    The Company's Level 3 financial
investments are held in funds professionally managed by investment
managers.  The net asset values are furnished in statements received
from fund custodians whose statements reflect valuations conducted according to
their respective fund pricing policies and asset types.  The complete
details of the fund holdings of several of the Company's professionally managed
funds may be unavailable at times, limiting the Company's ability to look
through to the underlying assets at the date the financial statements are
prepared.  Because of these constraints, the Company classifies these
fund investments as Level 3.
    
    In
connection with an acquisition, the Company is obligated to make
acquisition-related contingent payments of up to $439 based upon the achievement
of future research and development milestones that would be expected to create
value for Alcon. At the acquisition date, the fair value of these payments was
estimated to be $71 and was included as a cost of the acquisition.
    
    There are
a number of milestones that could potentially lead to such payments to the
sellers.  This valuation was based on the Company's estimates of the
probability and timing of these contingent payments. The fair value measurement
was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents
a Level 3 measurement.  Each milestone was assigned a probability
based on its current status.  The resultant probability-weighted cash
flows were then discounted using a discount rate of 6%, which the Company
believes is appropriate and representative of a market participant
assumption.  The probabilities assigned to payment streams ranged from
5% to 39%.  An increase or decrease of 10 percentage points in the
probability assumptions would result in an adjustment to the estimated value of
approximately $30.
    
    The fair
value of these contingent payments will be reviewed on a periodic
basis.  Any future changes in this estimated value not associated with
the original purchase price valuation will be recorded in the Company's results
of operations.

Value by Category
    
    Financial assets and financial
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were categorized in the
tables below based upon the lowest hierarchical level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.

    Level
3 Gains and Losses
    
    At December 31, 2009, trading
securities were the only type of financial assets included in Level
3.  The trading securities were professionally managed investment
funds, which included hedge funds of $22.  The fair value of the
investment funds classified as Level 3 could not be determined by independent
market observation or through the use of other observable valuation
techniques.  The valuation was based on net asset values as furnished
by the funds' custodian.  If more than an insignificant proportion of
a particular fund's assets were Level 3, the entire fund was classified as Level
3, although many of the fund's individual holdings may meet the definition of
Level 1 or Level 2.  The only liabilities included in Level 3 were the
acquisition-related contingency payments, as discussed earlier in this
note.
    
    Total
gains or losses (realized and unrealized) for financial assets and liabilities
classified as Level 3 that were included in earnings before income taxes were a
component of other, net, in the consolidated statements of
earnings.  For the year ended December 31, 2009, there were net gains
(realized and unrealized) of $7 from trading securities, 
     
    
      
        
           

        
        
          27
           

        
        
           

        
      
      and the
Company received proceeds from sales of Level 3 trading securities of
$246.  Realized and unrealized net gains
during the period were approximately 3% of the beginning balance for Level 3
trading securities and did not negatively affect or materially impact
operations, liquidity or capital resources.
    
    
    The table presented below summarizes
the change in carrying values associated with Level 3 financial instruments
during the year ended December 31, 2009.

    At
December 31, 2008, trading securities were the only type of financial assets
included in Level 3.  The trading securities were professionally
managed investment funds, which included fixed income funds of $107, a senior
secured bank loans fund of $41 and hedge funds of $113.  The financial
assets included in Level 3 were approximately 44% of the total amounts measured
at fair value on a recurring basis.  The fair value of the investment
funds classified as Level 3 could not be determined by independent market
observation or through the use of other observable valuation
techniques.  If more than an insignificant proportion of a particular
fund's assets were Level 3, the entire fund was classified as Level 3, although
many of the fund's individual holdings may meet the definition of Level 1 or
Level 2.
    
    Total
gains and losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings before income
taxes for financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 were a
component of other, net, in the consolidated statements of
earnings.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, there were losses
(realized and unrealized) of $77 from trading securities, and the Company
received proceeds from sales of Level 3 trading securities of
$148.  Realized and unrealized losses during the period were
approximately 16% of the beginning balance for Level 3 trading securities and
did not negatively affect or materially impact operations, liquidity or capital
resources.

    Valuation
Techniques
    
    Valuation techniques used for financial
assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized
into three types:  market approach, income approach and cost
approach.  The Company valued its Level 3 financial assets and
liabilities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 primarily using the market approach
and, to a lesser extent, the income approach.
    
    Market
Approach.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant
information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable
assets or liabilities.  Valuation techniques consistent with the
market approach include comparables.  A majority of the Company's
balances measured at fair value on a recurring basis were valued using the
market approach.  Most measurements were market quotes or obtained
from other reliable market sources.  The Company did not use market
indices for valuing material balances measured at fair value.
    
    Income
Approach.  Income approach valuation techniques convert future
amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present or discounted
amount.  The measurement is based on the value indicated by current
market expectations about those future amounts.  Examples of income
approach valuation techniques include present value techniques, option-pricing
models, binomial or lattice models that incorporate present value techniques and
option-pricing models.  The Company valued certain derivatives, in
part or whole, and acquisition-related contingent payments using the income
approach.
    
    Cost Approach.  The
cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace
the service capacity of an asset.  The Company did not employ the cost
approach for determining fair value of financial assets and
liabilities.
     
    
      
         

      
      
        29
         

      
      
         

      
    
    The valuation approaches are consistent
with generally accepted valuation methodologies.  While all three
approaches are not applicable to all assets or liabilities accounted for at fair
value, where appropriate and possible, one or more valuation techniques may be
used.  Professionally managed investment funds may use a combination
of market, income and cost approaches.  The process of selecting which
valuation method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and the
nature of the asset or liability being valued and significant expertise and
judgment is required.
    
    In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance
for both estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the
asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances
that indicate a transaction is not orderly.  If there has been a
significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or
liability, transactions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value
and would require further analysis or adjustment in a fair value
assessment.  Similarly, if a transaction is determined to be not
orderly, significant adjustment to transaction prices may be necessary in order
to estimate fair value using those prices.  This guidance became
effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009.  The Company
determined the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial
statements was not significant.
    
    Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment of Available-for-Sale Investments
    
    The Company reviews quarterly its
available-for-sale investments to identify impaired equity and debt
securities.  An individual security is impaired if the fair value of
the investment is less than its amortized cost basis.  Impairment may
be either temporary or other-than-temporary.
    
    The Company normally reviews securities
held in its portfolio that have been in a continuous loss position for twelve
months or longer and securities whose fair value is significantly lower than its
amortized cost basis.  Impairment is evaluated using a combination of
quantitative and qualitative factors such as considering the length of time and
extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer, as well as the Company's ability and intent
to hold the investments for an adequate period of time until an anticipated
market price recovery or maturity.  If an impairment is determined to
be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value, and a
loss is recognized immediately through earnings.
    
    In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance
on assessing other-than-temporary impairment on debt
securities.   Under U.S. GAAP, if debt securities are evaluated
for impairment, management must assess its intent and ability to hold the
security until recovery in its impairment analysis.  The additional
guidance states that, in its impairment analysis of debt securities, management
must assess whether it does not have the intent to sell the security before
maturity and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the
security before recovery of its cost basis.  This guidance became
effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009.  The Company
determined the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial
statements was not significant.
    
    In addition, the Company assesses
whether there are probable credit losses associated with impaired
available-for-sale debt securities.  The portion of an
other-than-temporary impairment of an available-for-sale debt security that is
related to credit loss is recognized in earnings and the remainder of the
difference between the cost basis of the debt security and its fair value is
recorded in other comprehensive income.
    
    The Company determined that, at
December 31, 2009, there were no unrealized losses on available-for-sale
investments that were other-than-temporarily impaired and there were no credit
losses on any investments.
    
    The Company determined that, at
December 31, 2008, unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale equity
securities and a senior secured bank loans fund were other-than-temporarily
impaired due to deteriorating general market conditions, particularly during the
fourth quarter of 2008, coupled with the unlikely near term prospects for
achieving a sustainable recovery, uncertainty about future market conditions,
and declines in certain quantitative or qualitative factors.  The
other-than-temporary impairment recognized for the senior secured bank loans
fund also was deemed appropriate to bring a significant portion of the
unrealized losses in line with current market conditions for credit default
rates and loss recovery rates.  The Company recognized losses for
other-than-temporary impairment during the year ended December 31, 2008 of
$37.

    Concentrations of Credit
Risk
    
    As part
of its ongoing control procedures, the Company monitors concentrations of credit
risk associated with corporate issuers of securities and financial institutions
with which it conducts business.  Credit risk is minimal as credit
exposure limits are established to avoid a concentration with any single issuer
or institution.  The Company also monitors the creditworthiness of its
customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of
business.  Concentrations of credit risk associated with these trade
receivables are considered minimal due to the Company's diverse customer
base.  Bad debts have been minimal.  The Company does not
normally require collateral or other security to support credit
sales.

      of Long-Lived Assets Held and Used
            
          
    
    
    During the year ended December 31,
2007, the Company recognized losses totaling $33 related to the impairment of
certain plant, equipment and intangible assets used in its refractive product
line and to the valuation of refractive product inventories.  The
losses were recorded in cost of goods sold ($24) and amortization of intangibles
($9) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31,
2007.
    
    During March 2007, in connection with
the Company's ongoing review of its refractive product line, the Company
determined that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets used in the refractive
product line probably would not be recovered through the respective projected
cash flows, although the Company continued to use those
assets.  Consequently, the impairment review was conducted using the
then-latest projections on a gross basis to determine whether the carrying
amounts of the refractive assets were recoverable.  After the carrying
amounts were determined not recoverable, a traditional discounted cash flow
calculation was used to estimate the fair values of the refractive
assets for the purpose of measuring the impairment losses, as the Company
believes this approach provided the most reasonable estimate of the fair values
of those assets.

    At
December 31, 2009, the Company had several unsecured line of credit agreements
with third parties totaling $541 that were denominated in various
currencies.  The commitment fees related to unused borrowings under
these facilities were less than $1 during 2009, 2008 and 2007.  The
weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 2.2% and
3.8%, respectively.  The amounts outstanding under these agreements at
December 31, 2009 were due at various dates during 2010.
    
    At December 31, 2009, the Company had a
$2,000 commercial paper facility.  At December 31, 2009, the
outstanding balance carried an average interest rate of 0.1% before
fees.  Nestlé guarantees the commercial paper facility and assists in
its management, for which the Company pays Nestlé an annual fee based on the
average outstanding commercial paper balances.  The Company's
management believes that any fees paid by the Company to Nestlé for their
guarantee of any indebtedness or for the management of the commercial paper
program are comparable to the fees that would be paid in an arm's length
transaction.  Total fees paid to Nestlé in connection with this
facility for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were less than $1
per year.
    
    The
Company had various unsecured promissory notes and line of credit agreements
denominated in various currencies with several subsidiaries of
Nestlé.  These short term borrowings at December 31, 2009 were either
due on demand or at various dates during 2010.  The weighted average
interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 10.7% and 2.4%,
respectively.  The unused portion under the line of credit agreements
was $213 at December 31, 2009.  In the event of a change of control,
these agreements would no longer be available for additional borrowings, and any
outstanding balances would become payable in accordance with the related
terms.
    
    The
Company had several unsecured bank overdraft lines of credit denominated in
various currencies totaling $191 at December 31, 2009.  The weighted
average interest rates on bank overdrafts at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
4.5% and 8.1%, respectively.

obligation in the event that Nestlé's ownership of Alcon falls below
51%.
    
    Interest

    Income
tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflected a net reduction of
$271 for period items, including a reduction of $236 related to losses
associated with the Company's investment in and advances to its former
subsidiary, Summit Autonomous, Inc., as well as reductions related to progress
in audit settlements, advance pricing agreement negotiations, the lapse of
statutes of limitation and other minor items.
    
    Current
tax expense does not reflect benefits of $22, $61 and $111 for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to restricted shares and
the exercise of employee stock options, recorded directly to additional paid-in
capital.
    
    In 2009 and 2008, the Company realized
certain Swiss tax benefits totaling approximately $145 and $130, respectively,
for its commitment to relocate and significantly expand its global
administration operations in Switzerland.  The initial term of these
benefits is expected to continue from 2008 for a period of five
years.  These benefits would be extended for an additional five years
if the Company fulfills certain employment commitments and maintains these
commitments through 2022.
    
    A reconciliation of income tax expense
at the statutory tax rate of 7.8% in Switzerland to the consolidated effective
tax rate follows:

be realized.  Based on the Company's historical pretax earnings,
management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the
benefit of the existing net deferred income tax assets at December 31,
2009.  Management believes the existing net deductible temporary
differences will reverse during periods in which the Company generates net
taxable earnings; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will
generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future
years.  Certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented,
if necessary, to supplement earnings from operations to fully realize tax
benefits.
    
    Withholding
taxes of approximately $91 have not been provided on approximately $1,821 of
unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries since such earnings are, or will be,
reinvested in operations indefinitely.  Taxes of approximately $14
have not been provided on temporary differences of approximately $175 for
permanent investments in certain subsidiaries that will be taxable upon
liquidation.
    
    The Company or one of its subsidiaries
files income tax returns in Switzerland, the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and
various state and foreign jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to Swiss, U.S. federal, state and local, or
non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before
2003.  In the first quarter of 2007, the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") commenced an examination of the Company's U.S. income tax returns for
2003 through 2005 that was substantially completed in May 2009.  In
June 2009, the IRS commenced an examination of the Company's U.S. income tax
returns for 2006 and 2007 that is anticipated to be completed substantially by
the end of 2010.  In May 2009, the IRS and the Company entered the
Compliance Assurance Process (″CAP″) program for 2009.  The Company
also currently is subject to income tax examinations by various

    state,
local and foreign tax authorities.  In addition, in June 2009, the
Company and the IRS signed an advance pricing agreement ("APA") contract
memorializing the mutual agreement letter between Switzerland and the United
States for years through 2014 that covers all material intercompany transactions
involving the Company and its subsidiaries in these two
jurisdictions.  Finally, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the
Company submitted a similar request for a bilateral APA between Japanese and
Swiss tax authorities that would cover the tax years 2008 through
2012.  The Company expects that the Japanese-Swiss APA will be
concluded in 2010.
    
    The Company believes that it takes
reasonable positions on its tax returns filed throughout the world; however, tax
laws are complex and susceptible to differing interpretations.  Tax
authorities throughout the world, from time to time, routinely challenge
positions taken by the Company, particularly in the case of transfer pricing
issues.  The Company has identified its uncertain tax positions and
prepared its reserve for contingent tax liabilities to reflect the associated
unrecognized tax benefits (the "Tax Reserves") in accordance with FASB guidance
which, among other things, requires that the Company assume that it will be
subject to examination in every jurisdiction in which it is subject to
tax.  Management believes that the Tax Reserves are fairly stated but
believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits related to transfer pricing, currency translations and other tax
positions reflected in the Tax Reserves will significantly increase or decrease
within 12 months of the reporting of this financial statement as the result of,
among other things, (i) developments with respect to currently active audits or
advance pricing agreements and/or (ii) the further development of tax laws
through judicial or administrative actions.  Although tax laws are
complex and significant uncertainty exists with respect to the actual date that
any of the currently active audits or APA negotiations could reach final
resolution or a new audit could commence, management believes it is reasonably
possible that unrecognized tax benefits could increase in the next 12 months by
at least 10% or decrease by over 60% as a result of actual payment of amounts
included in the Tax Reserves and/or developments in various negotiations with
tax authorities.
    
    A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and
penalties, related to uncertain tax positions is as follows:

    During the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest
and penalties, included in the Tax Reserves decreased by $56 to $74 and
decreased by $195 to $130, respectively.  The net decrease in
unrecognized tax benefits in 2009 reflected the resolution of various audits,
progress on ongoing audits, APA negotiations, the development of case law, the
lapse of statutes of limitations and other minor items.  The net
decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in 2008 reflected (i) the Company's Pre-Filing Agreement with the
IRS related to losses associated with the Company's investment in and advances to
its former subsidiary, Summit Autonomous, Inc., of $179 and (ii) net reductions
of $16 related to progress on audit settlements, APA negotiations, the lapse of
statutes of limitation and other minor items.  The amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized
at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $69 and $120, respectively.
    
    The Company's policy is to classify
interest and penalties in income tax expense.  The gross amount of
interest and penalties accrued as part of the Tax Reserves at December 31, 2009
and 2008 were $9 and $18, respectively.  At December 31, 2009, the
consolidated balance sheet included $19 in other current liabilities and $57 in
other long term liabilities for the Tax Reserves, net of deposits with statutory
authorities.  At December 31, 2008, the

    consolidated
balance sheet included $1 in other current liabilities and $29 in other long

authorities.  The gross amounts of interest and penalties included in
the consolidated statements of earnings for 2009 and 2008 were not
significant.

    The
Company conducts its global business through two business segments: Alcon United
States and Alcon International.  Alcon United States includes sales to
unaffiliated customers located in the United States of America, excluding Puerto
Rico.  Alcon United States operating income is derived from operating
profits within the United States.  Alcon International includes sales
to all other unaffiliated customers.
    
    Each
business segment markets and sells products principally in three product
categories of the ophthalmic market:  (1) pharmaceutical (prescription
drugs), (2) surgical equipment and devices (cataract, vitreoretinal and
refractive), and (3) consumer eye care (contact lens disinfectants and cleaning
solutions, artificial tears and ocular vitamins).  Business segment
operations generally do not include research and development, certain
manufacturing and other corporate functions.
    
    Segment
performance is measured based on sales and operating income reported in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.
    
    Certain manufacturing costs and
manufacturing variances are not assigned to business segments because most
manufacturing operations produce products for more than one business
segment.  Research and development costs, excluding regulatory costs
which are included in the business segments, are treated as general corporate
costs and are not assigned to business segments.
    
    Identifiable
assets are not assigned by business segment and are not considered in evaluating
the performance of the business segments.

    Certain
2008 and 2007 expenses were reclassified to align with the 2009 reporting
structure, the most significant of which was to move the operating expenses of
the Swiss service center from the general corporate function to the
International business segment.
    
    On
February 11, 2009, the Company announced that it initiated programs to align its
operations with the evolving economic conditions and market
environment.  These programs included a staffing reduction of
approximately 260 employee positions that resulted in a pre-tax charge of $19
for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was included in general corporate
expenses.
    
    For the
year ended December 31, 2007, losses related to the impairment discussed in note
6 increased general corporate expenses within operating income by $33 and
increased depreciation and amortization by $19.

              Share-Based
      Compensation Plans
            
          
    
    
    Under the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive
Plan, the Company's board of directors may award to officers, directors and key
employees share-based compensation, including stock options, share-settled stock
appreciation rights ("SSARs"), restricted shares, share-settled restricted share
units ("RSUs"), performance share units and certain cash-settled liability
awards.  The total number of shares that may be issued under the plan
with respect to such awards cumulatively shall not exceed 40 million Alcon
common shares.  The number of shares that may be delivered pursuant to
an exercise or after a lapse of a restriction period may not exceed 10% of the
total number of shares issued and outstanding at that time.  The grant
prices for stock options or stock appreciation rights shall not be lower than
the prevailing stock exchange price upon the grant of the award, unless
specifically approved by the board.
    
    Individual grants become exercisable
generally on or after the third anniversary of the grant and lapse on the tenth
anniversary of the grant.  Grants prior to February 2006 also become
exercisable upon early retirement at or after age 55.  If there is a
change in control (as defined by the plan), the exercise or vesting of the
awards accelerates.
    
    Beginning in February 2006, consistent
with earlier grants, participants may vest in the stock option and SSAR grants
upon early retirement at or after age 55; however, under grants subsequent to
January 2006, participants may exercise these instruments only on or after the
third anniversary of the grant.  Restricted share and restricted share
unit awards are subject to a three-year cliff vesting; furthermore, participants
retiring before reaching age 60 for awards granted subsequent to January 2006
through December 2008, or age 62 for awards granted subsequent to January 2009,
will forfeit some or all of such awards if the three-year service period has not
expired.
    
    The Company intends to satisfy all
equity awards granted prior to December 31, 2003 and after December 31, 2007
with the issuance of new shares from conditional capital authorized for the
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan.  At December 31, 2009, the Company
had reserved approximately 12.3 million Alcon common shares for issuance
pursuant to the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan.

    The Company's board of directors has
authorized the acquisition on the open market of Alcon common shares to, among
other things, satisfy the share-based awards requirements granted under the
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan.  At December 31, 2009, outstanding
authorizations by the Company's board of directors would have permitted the
purchase of approximately 1.8 million Alcon common shares.  The
Company has purchased treasury shares on the open market to satisfy the majority
of the outstanding equity awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2003 and
prior to January 1, 2008.  Additional treasury shares were purchased
during 2008 and 2007 in anticipation of presenting the shares to the
shareholders for approval of cancellation (note 17).
    
    Change
of Control Provisions
    
    Upon a
change of control in the ownership of Alcon, such as Novartis's intended
purchase of Nestlé's common shares of Alcon (discussed in note 17), the
Company's share-based compensation awards granted to employees prior to January
1, 2009 will vest immediately.  However, the vesting of similar awards
granted after January 1, 2009 will accelerate only if the respective
participant's employment with the Company or its successor is terminated without
cause, or by the participant under certain circumstances, within six months
preceding or during the two years following a change of control.  If
Alcon is not the surviving corporation under a change in control, the equivalent
value of the successor's securities may be substituted for Alcon shares under
the awards.
     
    Equity Awards
    
    Net
earnings for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 reflected the
impact of compensation cost for all share-based payments based on the estimated
grant-date "fair value."
    
    The
effects of share-based equity awards on operating income and net earnings for
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

    Compensation expense for equity awards
was calculated on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period of
the applicable share-based awards, with acceleration of the expense for
individuals meeting the requirements for retirement, as described
above.
    
    As of December 31, 2009, total
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based equity
compensation arrangements (including share options, SSARs and nonvested share
and share unit awards) granted under the plan was $72.  That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4
years.
    
    Options
and SSARs
    
    The "fair value" of each stock option
and SSAR grant was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions:

        The Company based
its estimates of expected volatility on daily historical trading data of its
common shares from March 2002 through the grant dates and, due to its short
history as a public company when compared to length of the term of the
instruments, other factors, such as the volatility of the common share prices of
other pharmaceutical and surgical companies.
     
    The risk-free interest rate assumptions
were based on implied yields, at the grant dates, of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
bonds having a remaining term equal to the expected term of the employee share
awards.
    
    The expected dividend yield was
estimated generally based upon the Company's historic dividend yield since 2003,
projected dividend increases and other relevant information.
    
    The Company estimated the expected term
consistent with historical exercise and cancellation activity of its previous
share-based grants with a ten-year contractual term, as well as that of other
pharmaceutical and surgical companies.
    
    Forfeitures of stock options and SSARs
were estimated to be 6.3% in 2009 (7.3% in 2008 and 6.0% in 2007) of the number
granted, based on historical experience.
    
    If factors change and the Company
employs different assumptions to account for share-based payments in future
periods, the compensation expense that the Company records may differ
significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current
period.

SSARs as of December 31, 2009 and the changes during the year then ended are

shares and RSUs were estimated to be 8.3% of the number granted, based on
historical experience.  The status of the nonvested restricted shares
and RSUs as of December 31, 2009 and the changes during the year then ended are

    The weighted average grant-date market
values of restricted shares granted during the year ended December 31, 2007 was
$131.  No such instruments were granted during 2009 and
2008.  The total market values of restricted shares that vested during
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $14, $4 and $1,
respectively.
    
    The weighted average grant-date market
values of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
were $89, $147 and $131 per share, respectively.  The total market
values of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007 were $6, less than $1 and less than $1, respectively.
    
    Performance
Share Units
    
    In February 2009 and 2008, pursuant to
the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, the Company's board of directors approved
the grants of approximately 47,000 and 37,000 performance share units,
respectively, to the senior executive officers and other selected
executives.  The performance share units are designed to award
additional compensation in the form of Alcon shares if certain earnings per
share targets are met.  The final awards may be adjusted by a total
shareholder return multiplier.  If minimum earnings per share targets
are not met, no Alcon shares are delivered under the awards.  These
awards do not pay dividend equivalents during the performance
period.  The 2009 and 2008 performance share units vest at the end of
a three-year service period, with forfeitures if the recipient is not fully
vested before age 62 or 60, respectively.
    
    The "fair value" of each performance
share unit was estimated at the grant date assuming that the target performance
goal will be achieved and using a Monte Carlo simulation approach to model
adjustments for total shareholder return modifier provisions.  The
following weighted average assumptions were incorporated into the valuation
model:

    In the
event that the minimum performance goals are not met, previously recognized
compensation cost will be reversed.  The Company recognizes the "fair
values" of performance share units over the required service
period.
    
    Forfeitures of performance share units
were estimated to be 1.5% in 2009 (2.3% in 2008) of the number granted, based on
historical experience of other types of awards and the limited number of
executives receiving

    The weighted average grant-date "fair
values" of performance share units granted during the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008 were $86 and $152 per instrument, respectively.  No
performance share units vested during the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008.  No such instruments were granted or vested prior to
2008.
     
    Liability Awards
    
    The Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan
also provides that the board may grant cash-settled stock appreciation rights
("CSARs") whereby the grantee may receive the appreciation in share value over
the grant price.  Individual grants become exercisable generally on or
after the third anniversary of the grant and lapse on the tenth anniversary of
the grant.  In addition to scheduled vesting, shares are fully vested
upon meeting the requirements for retirement.
    
    The Company accounts for CSARs as
share-based liability awards that are remeasured each reporting period through
the awards' settlement dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and
similar assumptions to those used for measuring equity grants.  At
December 31, 2009, all CSARs were fully vested and were measured at their
intrinsic value.  The market price for Alcon common shares was $164
per share.  The risk-free interest rates used at December 31, 2008
were 0.11% to 3.05% and the market price for Alcon's common shares was $89 per
share.  The risk-free interest rates used at December 31, 2007 were
3.05% to 3.34% and the market price for Alcon's common shares was $143 per
share.
    
    The Company's operating results
included expenses (reversals) related to the CSARs of $2, $(2) and $5 for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The
weighted average grant-date "fair values" of CSARs granted during the year ended
December 31, 2007 was $131.  No such instruments were granted in 2009
and 2008.  During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
the total intrinsic values of CSARs paid were less than $1, $7 and $7,
respectively.
    
    The status of the CSARs as of December
31, 2009 and the changes during the year then ended are presented

    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
Company had 30,106 and 34,756 CSARs outstanding representing liabilities of $3
and $1, respectively.  The awards outstanding had expiration dates
ranging from March 2012 through February 2015.
    
    The Company expects to use liability
awards minimally in the future.  As of December 31, 2009, there was no
unrecognized compensation cost related to CSARs granted under the
plan.

              Deferred
      Compensation
            
          
    
    
    The Alcon
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan permits certain executives of the Company
to defer receipt of compensation and certain stock gains otherwise payable
currently and to accumulate earnings thereon on a tax-deferred
basis.  The plan is designed to permit executives' deferral elections
to be held and owned by the Company in a Rabbi trust.  During the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, certain executives elected to
defer compensation totaling $1 annually.  At December 31, 2009 and
2008, other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets included liabilities under the plan of $13 at each date.
    
    In 2004, the Company established the
Alcon Excess 401(k) Plan, allowing deferral of excess employer contributions
that cannot be made to the Alcon 401(k) Retirement Plan because of limitations
under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  During the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, deferrals under the plan were $3, $3 and $2
respectively.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, liabilities under the
plan, included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, were $13 and $9, respectively.

    The
Company leases certain facilities from Nestlé subsidiaries which resulted in
rent expense of $3, $2 and $2 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  Nestlé provides the Company with certain services,
including a portion of the Company's information technology licenses, corporate
legal services, certain treasury and cash management activities and certain
internal audit activities.  Nestlé charges the Company for its portion
of the costs of these services based on arm's length prices.  Such
charges were less than $3 in each of the three years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007.
    
    During
2008, Lehman Brothers International (Europe) London filed for administration in
England.  At that time the Company's cash and cash equivalents
included $707 of short term securities held in a segregated custodial account of
Lehman Brothers International (Europe) London pursuant to a Custody
Agreement.  Nestlé invoiced the Company in December 2008, and in 2009
the Company reimbursed Nestlé, for a total of $5 in fees paid by Nestlé to the
Joint Administrators of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (in
administration) related to the release of the short-term securities held in the
custodial account.  This amount of fees is subject to adjustment
depending on the final costs incurred to settle the administration of Lehman
Brothers International (Europe).
    
    The
Company executes certain foreign exchange contracts through Nestlé Finance SA,
Cham to benefit from Nestlé's foreign exchange transaction volumes and
expertise.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had no notional
amounts outstanding with Nestlé.
    
    The
Company participates with certain Nestlé affiliates in specific cash pooling
accounts under which overdraft lines of credit are available and are jointly and
severally guaranteed by all participants, including the Company.  At
December 31, 2009, the total maximum under these lines of credit was
approximately $305.
    
    The
Company is part of the Nestlé Swiss Value-Added Tax Group and therefore jointly
and severally liable for any Swiss value-added tax liabilities of all other
Group participants.
    
    On
January 9, 2009, Alcon Pharmaceuticals Ltd. entered into an agreement with
Novartis Pharma AG (an affiliate of Novartis) providing for the co-promotion
under their license of the Lucentis®

December 31, 2011.  The Company received co-promotion fees totaling $3
in 2009.

Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans, which in aggregate cover
substantially all employees in the United States and employees in certain other
countries, consist of defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans
and a postretirement healthcare plan.  The Company's cost of defined
contribution plans was $86, $78 and $76 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

    The
discount rate for the defined benefit pension plans was determined by matching,
as of the measurement date, the expected future cash flows with high-quality
fixed-income securities of the same duration.  This resulted in a
weighted average discount rate of 5.4% as an appropriate equivalent annualized
rate.
    
    The
discount rate for the postretirement benefit plan was determined by matching the
expected future cash flows with high quality fixed-income securities of the same
duration as of the measurement date, resulting in a discount rate of
6.0%.
    
    The
expected long term rates of return on plan assets were based on historical
market index returns for the applicable asset classes weighted in proportion to
the target allocation of the plan.  The return assumption for the
postretirement benefits plan also took into account the estimated cost of life
insurance coverage and insurer profit due to the use of the trust-owned life
insurance investment vehicle.
    
    At December 31, 2009, the Company
adopted the provisions of the Compensation-Defined Benefits-Disclosure Topic of
the ASC, as adopted by the FASB, which enhances disclosure requirements for fair
value measurements.  The required hierarchical levels were discussed
in note 5.
    
    Pension Plan
Assets
    
    The Company's overall investment
strategy is to achieve a mix of investments for long-term growth and investments
for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund
strategies, and fund managers.  The strategies use a variety of asset
classes to provide return opportunities that are consistent with the

    Company's
acceptable risk tolerance.  The majority of the Company's plans are
unfunded, with the major funded plans designated for employees in Japan, Belgium
and Spain.
    
    The target allocations for plan assets
at December 31, 2009 (on a weighted-average basis) were 14% equity securities,
15% debt securities, 38% guaranteed investment contracts and 33% other
investments.  Equity securities primarily included investment in large
capitalization companies and index funds located in the United States and
Europe.  Debt securities were primarily government bonds in Europe,
Japan and the United States.  The guaranteed investment contract was
with an insurance company located in Japan used to fund benefits for employees
in Japan.  Other investments consisted of investment funds mainly
invested in a mix of debt and equity securities for employees in Belgium and the
Netherlands.
    
    Expected long-term rates-of-return on
assets were based primarily on historical returns and asset-liability modeling
studies and considered expected real returns, inflation fluctuations and
volatility of each asset category.
    
    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
Company's asset allocations by asset category were as follows:

              This
      category is primarily guaranteed investment contracts in Japan
      administered through insurance companies with guaranteed returns of
      0.75%.  The life insurance companies pool pension plan assets
      together from all the participating companies and generally invest in a
      relatively conservative asset mix

      domestic and foreign equity, loans and other
  investments.
            
          
    
    
      

            
              (d)  
            
            
              This
      category includes assets held in a variety of funds primarily managed by
      Nestlé Capital Management (a Nestlé affiliate) and State Street Global
      Advisors for the benefit of employees in Belgium and the
      Netherlands.  Equity funds consist of Robusta European, Common
      Contractual and Emerging Market funds (operated by Nestlé's investment
      management company) and State Street Global Advisors Asia Pacific and
      World Index funds.  Fixed income funds consist of Euro
      government bonds, Robusta Inflation Linked and Global Credit Bonds
      (operated by Nestlé's investment management company).  A minor
      portion of the funds are invested in real estate, commodities and absolute
      return hedge funds.
            
          
    
    
    In 2005,
the Company transferred $200 to an irrevocable Rabbi trust to be held and
invested in an unfunded arrangement for the payment of benefits to participants
under certain defined benefit pension plans of the Company.  At
December 31, 2009, the accompanying balance sheet included net assets of the
trust (cash and cash equivalents of $44 and short term investments of $245) that
were restricted to the payment of pension benefits except under certain
conditions, such as the Company's insolvency or termination of the
trust.  The Alcon Executive Retirement Plans Trust Agreement provides
for the Company to fund the current actuarially determined present value of the
aggregate accrued pension benefits of all participants in the event the Company
undergoes a change of control, such as Novartis's intended purchase of Nestlé's
common shares of Alcon (discussed in note 17).  Management estimates
that a significant contribution to the trust would be required.
    
    The
Company does not anticipate that any assets from defined benefit plans would be
returned to the Company during the year ending December 31, 2010.
    
    Postretirement Benefits
Assets
    
    The Company's overall investment
strategy for these fund assets is to invest in long-term growth assets
(excluding necessary cash for near-term benefit payments) with a wide
diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and fund
managers.  The strategies use a variety of asset classes to provide
return opportunities that are consistent with the Company's acceptable risk
tolerances.  The post retirement plan is a U.S. plan having assets
funded to a Voluntary Employee Benefit Association ("VEBA") trust and to a
401(h) account under the Alcon Retirement Plan.  The target
allocations for plan assets at December 31, 2009 were 6% cash and cash
equivalents, 61% global equity securities, 25% corporate bonds, and 8% other
investments.  Equity securities primarily included investment in large
cap companies located around the world.  Corporate bonds were
primarily investment-grade bonds of companies in diversified industries
primarily located in the United States.  Other investments consisted
of real estate investments, hedge funds and commodities.  Expected
long-term rates-of-return on assets were primarily based on historical
returns.
    
    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
Company's asset allocations by asset category were as follows:

    Effective January 1, 2008, the Company
adopted a provision to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its
year-end balance sheet.  The Company utilized the alternate transition
method to transition the measurement date for its defined pension benefit plan
in Japan from September 30 to December 31.  Under this transition
method, the Company charged 3/15ths of the estimated pension cost from October
1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 (or $1, net of taxes) to retained earnings as of
January 1, 2008.
    
    Certain
U.S. defined benefit plans contain change of control provisions such that, upon
a change in control in the ownership of Alcon such as Novartis's intended
purchase of Nestlé's common shares of Alcon (discussed in note 17), special
termination benefits and curtailment charges would be recognized immediately and
payments of related pension benefits would be accelerated.  Management
estimates that such charges would impact significantly the Company's results of
operations in the period in which a change of control occurs.
    
    The
healthcare cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered
by the postretirement plan is 8.7% at December 31, 2009, declining to 5% in 2014
and after.  The effect of a one percentage point change in assumed
medical cost trend rates is as follows:

      material
to the Company or to Nestlé.  Accordingly, these plans are treated as
multi-employer plans.  Annual contributions to these plans are
determined by Nestlé and charged to the Company.  Company
contributions to these plans during 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $9, $10 and $8,
respectively.  Due to the recent financial market decline, future
contributions may not reflect past trends.  During 2009, the Company
obtained a separate valuation for its Belgium and Netherlands subsidiaries'
defined benefit pension plans and converted from multi-employer plans to
single-employer plans.  The Company obtained a separate valuation for
its Spanish subsidiary's defined benefit pension plan in 2007 and converted from
a multi-employer plan to a single-employer plan.

shares, which the Company purchased during 2008.  After the
fulfillment of certain formal Swiss law requirements, the cancellation became

    On May 6,
2008, the Company's shareholders approved the cancellation of 7,657,400 Alcon

      Proposed
Change of Control
       
    
    On April
6, 2008, Nestlé and Novartis AG ("Novartis") executed the Purchase and Option
Agreement pursuant to which Nestlé agreed to sell approximately 74 million of
its shares of Alcon common stock to Novartis in a cash transaction at a price of
$143.18 per share.  This sale was consummated on July 7, 2008, and
Novartis now owns a minority stake in Alcon of slightly less than 25% of Alcon's
outstanding shares, while Nestlé remains Alcon's majority shareholder with
approximately 156 million Alcon shares comprising approximately 52% of the
Company's outstanding shares.
    
    The Purchase and Option Agreement
between Nestlé and Novartis also contains put and call option rights on the
balance of approximately 156 million Alcon shares owned by
Nestlé.  The option rights commenced on January 1, 2010 and expire on
July 31, 2011.  As outlined by the two parties, these rights
grant (i) Novartis a call option to buy all but 4.1 million (or 2.5%) of
Nestlé's remaining Alcon shares at a fixed price of $181 per share and the 4.1
million shares at the first stage price of $143.18 per share, and (ii) Nestlé a
put option to sell to Novartis all but 4.1 million of its remaining Alcon shares
to Novartis at the lower of Novartis's call price
of $181 per share or a premium of approximately 20.5% above the then-market
price of Alcon shares, which will be calculated as the average market price
of Alcon shares
during the five trading days immediately preceding the exercise date of the
put option, with the 4.1 million share balance to be sold at the first stage
closing price of $143.18 per share.
    
    On
January 4, 2010, Novartis announced that it had exercised its option to purchase
the remaining approximately 156 million Alcon shares owned by Nestlé at a
weighted average price of $180 per share in cash, pursuant to the Purchase and
Option Agreement.  Upon consummation of the purchase, Novartis would
own an approximate 77% interest in Alcon.
    
    The
consummation of a purchase and sale transaction under the option right is
subject to regulatory approvals.  The consummation would trigger
certain change of control provisions in the Company's share-based awards plan
(including the vesting of certain outstanding share-based awards), certain
retirement plans for Company employees and other agreements.
    
    Upon
consummation, the Company will no longer benefit from certain synergies as a
result of Nestlé's ownership.  Alcon has taken advantage of the
synergies in several functional areas.  Management does not anticipate
a significant financial impact to Alcon due to the loss of these synergies
because the Company is currently 
     
    
      
        
           

        
        
          53
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
      negotiating
with certain vendors/suppliers and financial services providers to mitigate any
potential impact from a change of control.  However, no assurances can
be made at this time.
    
    
    As a
result of Novartis's planned acquisition of Nestlé's remaining Alcon shares,
Alcon's relationships with third parties in the pharmaceutical and other
industries may be impacted, which in some cases may affect Alcon's business
development and licensing opportunities.
    
    Novartis
also announced that it submitted to the Alcon board of directors a proposal for
a merger of Alcon with and into Novartis to be effected under Swiss merger
law.  Under the terms of the merger proposal, holders of the
approximate 23% of Alcon shares that are publicly traded would receive 2.8
Novartis shares for each Alcon share.  The proposed merger would be
contingent upon, among other things, approval by the Alcon board of directors,
the closing of the purchase and sale transaction related to the Novartis option
exercise as well as receipt of required regulatory approvals.  Upon
Novartis becoming a majority shareholder of Alcon, management believes that the
Organizational Regulations provide that the Alcon board of directors may only
approve the proposed merger if a majority of the Independent Director Committee
so recommends; however, management cannot predict the outcome of any judicial
proceeding that might be initiated to interpret or challenge this
position.
    
    The Independent Director Committee was
formed in 2008 in connection with Novartis's initial purchase of slightly less
than 25% of the Alcon shares from Nestlé to evaluate transactions such as the
merger proposed by Novartis.  The Independent Director Committee
engaged independent financial and legal advisors in connection with its
evaluation of the proposed merger.  On January 20, 2010, the
Independent Director Committee issued its formal response rejecting the Novartis
merger proposal.  The committee rejected the merger proposal based on
its assessment that the price offered and other terms were not acceptable and
that Novartis's merger proposal was not in the best interests of Alcon and its
minority shareholders.
     
    
      Share
Repurchase Agreement Terminated
    
    
    In March 2008, as a result of the
then-pending agreement between Nestlé and Novartis discussed above, the Company
halted the purchase of Alcon common shares in the open market under all share
repurchase programs, and terminated the pro rata share repurchase agreement that
it had entered into following the December 2007 authorization by the board of
directors of the share repurchase program that provided for the purchase of up
to $1,100 of Alcon common shares.  Prior to its termination, the
Company had purchased a total of 150,000 shares under the agreement, comprised
of 112,500 shares from the Company's majority shareholder, Nestlé, and 37,500
shares from the market, for a total of $20.  The price for the shares
purchased from Nestlé under the agreement was equal to the volume-weighted
average price for such shares determined in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    
    The program authorized in December 2007
was in addition to the Company's pre-existing share repurchase program, under
which, as of December 31, 2008, the Company had remaining authorization to
purchase up to 1.8 million shares.  In April 2008, the Company halted
the purchase of Alcon common shares in the open market under all share
repurchase programs.  In September 2008, the Company continued to
purchase from the public under the pre-existing program up to 1 million Alcon
common shares to be presented to the shareholders for
retirement.  Neither Nestlé nor Novartis participated in this program
and their ownership interests did not change materially as a result of these
share repurchases.

Shareholder Class Action Lawsuits
    
    On January 4, 2010, Novartis announced
that it submitted to the Alcon board of directors a proposal for a merger of
Alcon with and into Novartis to be effected under Swiss merger law (note
17).  Under the terms of the merger proposal, holders of the
approximate 23% of Alcon shares that are publicly traded would receive 2.8

of slightly
less than 25% of the Alcon shares from Nestlé to evaluate transactions such as

its assessment that the price offered and other terms were not acceptable and
that Novartis's merger proposal was not in the best interests of Alcon and its
minority shareholders.
    
    
    Certain Alcon minority shareholders
have filed several class action lawsuits related to Novartis's merger proposal
concerning the acquisition of the remaining 23% publicly held minority
interest.  The claims vary among the cases, but include allegations
of: (i) breach of contract against Alcon; (ii) tortious interference with
contract against Novartis and Nestlé; (iii) breach of fiduciary duties against
the Alcon board of directors, Nestlé and Novartis; (iv) aiding and abetting
breaches of fiduciary duties against the Alcon board of directors, Nestlé and
Novartis; (v) breach of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act against Novartis and
Nestlé for an alleged failure to disclose that they were acting as a "group;"
and (vi) breach of Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act against Novartis and Nestlé
for an alleged failure to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
the materials required in connection with a "tender offer."  Seven of
the cases were filed in the Southern District of New York, all of which have
been consolidated into one class action case.  One case, which does
not name Alcon, Inc. and its board of directors as parties, has been filed in
the Eastern District of New York.  Two cases are pending in District
Court, Tarrant County, Texas; one case is pending in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division; and two cases have been
filed in the County Court at Law, Dallas County, Texas.
    
    We are currently unable to express an
opinion on the outcome of these class action cases due to their
infancy.
    
    Other
Contingencies
    
    Alcon, either alone or jointly with
its commercial partners, has filed thirteen North American patent infringement
actions against six different generic drug companies.  With the
exception of international generic challenges, all of these generic drug
companies are seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval to
market generic versions of Alcon products, under what are known as Abbreviated
New Drug Applications ("ANDAs").
    
    The first
infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice that Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. had filed an ANDA seeking approval to sell a generic
version of Alcon's Vigamox®
antibiotic ophthalmic solution.  Moxifloxacin, the primary ingredient
in Vigamox®, is
licensed to Alcon by Bayer Schering Pharma AG.  As part of its ANDA,
Teva challenged three patents covering Alcon's innovator product Vigamox®. Two
of the patents are owned by Alcon's licensor, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, and the
third, which expires in 2020, is owned by Alcon.  The two Bayer
Schering Pharma AG patents were also the subject of another Teva ANDA seeking
approval to sell a generic version of Bayer Schering Pharma AG's systemic
moxifloxacin product, Avelox®.  Suit
was filed by Alcon and Bayer Schering Pharma AG as co-plaintiffs against Teva
relative to the ANDA challenging Vigamox® on
April 5, 2006 in the U.S. District Court in Delaware.  Bayer Schering
Pharma AG subsequently filed suit in the same court relative to the Avelox® ANDA,
and the two suits were merged.  Trial was scheduled to begin February
26, 2008, but the dispute between Bayer Schering Pharma AG and Teva relative to
the two Bayer Schering Pharma AG patents was resolved by settlement on the eve
of trial.  Under the terms of the settlement, Teva acknowledged the
validity and enforceability of both Bayer Schering Pharma AG patents, and
further acknowledged that its proposed generic ophthalmic product would infringe
both patents.  Teva has therefore relinquished any claim that it is
entitled to market the generic ophthalmic product prior to September 4,
2014.  Alcon remains the exclusive ophthalmic licensee under the Bayer
Schering Pharma patents.  The trial relative to the Alcon patent began
on February 28, 2008 and concluded on March 6, 2008.  Since then,
Alcon has received a notice of allowance on a related patent application with
claims that will cover the Vigamox®
product and Teva's proposed generic product.  The issue fee has been
paid on that application, and the patent should issue by the first quarter of
2010.  On October 19, 2009, the court ruled in Alcon's favor on all
counts, finding the Alcon patent to be valid and infringed by the proposed
generic product.  On November 19, 2009, Teva filed a Notice of Appeal,
but that appeal was subsequently set aside by the Federal Circuit Court of
Appeals as being premature.  It is expected that the appeal will be
reinstated after the lower
    
      
        
           

        
        
          55
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
      court
amends its form of judgment.  However, even if Teva were to succeed in
having the district court decision reversed on appeal, it would still have to
address Alcon's recently allowed second patent before competing with
Alcon's
Vigamox®
product in September 2014 when the underlying Bayer patent
expires.  If Teva were to win on appeal and overcome Alcon's second
patent, the resulting generic competition would be expected to
impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.  On a related
note, Alcon's European counterpart patent to the patent-in-suit was determined
to be invalid in a European Patent Office Opposition Proceeding.  That
invalidity decision was upheld by an Enlarged Board of Appeal on October 22,
2009.
    
     
    
      The
second patent infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice that
Apotex, a Canadian-based generic drug company, had filed an ANDA challenging one
of the patents covering Alcon's Patanol®
anti-allergy eye product.  Alcon's raw material supplier, Kyowa Hakko
Kirin Co., Ltd., holds another U.S. patent, which has not been challenged in
this case and which expires on December 18, 2010.  In addition, Alcon
has secured a six-month pediatric extension to the patent coverage, which means
this generic challenge poses no threat to the Patanol®
product market prior to June 2011.  The patent that Apotex has
challenged, which is co-owned by Alcon and Kyowa, will expire in
2015.  Alcon and Kyowa, as co-plaintiffs, filed suit against Apotex
Inc. and Apotex Corp. on November 15, 2006 in the U.S. District Court in
Indianapolis, Indiana.  As a result of the lawsuit filing, the FDA was
required to delay any approval of the Apotex ANDA for 30 months until April
2009, unless the litigation were earlier resolved or the court were to modify
the 30-month stay on FDA approval.  Because of the protection until
June 2011, provided by the unchallenged Kyowa patent, the expiration of the
30-month period was inconsequential. Trial had
been scheduled for July 27, 2009, but was postponed and has now been rescheduled
for April 26, 2010 (consolidated with the Sandoz case described
below).  Should Apotex succeed in overcoming the challenged patent and
secure FDA approval, it would not be entitled to begin selling a generic
olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon's Patanol®
product in the United States until June 18, 2011.  Such competition
would be expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.
    
    
    The third
patent infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice on October 1,
2007 that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had filed an ANDA challenging the patents
underlying Alcon's Patanol®
product.  Unlike the Apotex ANDA described above, which is challenging
only the patent jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon, the Barr ANDA was also
challenging Kyowa's composition patent on olopatadine, the active agent in Patanol®.  Alcon
and Kyowa filed suit in the Federal District Court in Indianapolis (where the
Apotex case is pending) on October 23, 2007.  As a result of the
lawsuit filing, the FDA was required to delay any approval of the Barr ANDA for
30 months unless the litigation were earlier resolved or the court modified the
30-month stay on FDA approval.  The 30-month period after which the
FDA could approve Barr's generic product would expire at the end of March 2010,
nine months before the Kyowa composition patent expires.  Trial was
scheduled for late April 2010.  However, in September 2009, Barr
withdrew its ANDA and subsequently has been dismissed from the
suit.
    
    The
fourth patent infringement action was filed after Alcon received notice in late
November 2008 that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had filed an ANDA challenging the
patents underlying Alcon's Pataday™ once daily
olopatadine product.  The Barr ANDA is challenging the patent jointly
owned by Kyowa and Alcon (described above), as well as two later issued patents
owned by Alcon that cover the Pataday™
formulation.  Of the two Alcon patents, the latest expiry date is
November 2023.  Barr is not challenging the Kyowa patent on
olopatadine that expires in December 2010 (effectively extended until June 2011
by a pediatric extension).   Alcon and Kyowa filed suit in the
Federal District Court in Indianapolis on January 8, 2009.  As a
result of the lawsuit filing, the FDA must delay any approval of the Barr ANDA
for 30 months unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies
the 30-month stay on FDA approval.  The 30-month period after which
the FDA could approve Barr's generic product will expire in May
2011.  This case has been consolidated with the Apotex case (Pataday™) described
below. Trial has not
yet been scheduled in this case.  If Barr succeeds in overcoming all
of the challenged patents and secures FDA approval, it would be entitled to
begin selling a generic olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon's
Pataday™ product in the
United States on June 18, 2011.  Such competition would be expected to
impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    The fifth
and sixth ANDA patent suits were filed February 2, 2009 in the U.S. District
Court in Indianapolis against Apotex and Sandoz, respectively.

ANDA challenging the patents underlying Alcon's Pataday™ once daily
olopatadine product.  Like Barr's ANDA, the Apotex ANDA is challenging
the patent jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon (described above), as well as two
later issued patents owned by
Alcon that cover the Pataday™
formulation.  Apotex is not challenging the Kyowa patent on
olopatadine that expires in December 2010 (June 2011 with the pediatric
extension).  Because the suit was filed within the statutory 45-day
period, the FDA must delay any approval of the Apotex ANDA for 30 months (until
June 2011), unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies the
30-month stay on FDA approval.  In addition, because Apotex is the
second filer, it is also subject to the first filer's 180-day exclusivity
period, which could further delay its FDA approval. Trial has not yet been
scheduled in this case.  If Apotex succeeds in overcoming both of the
challenged patents and secures FDA approval, then after the expiration of Barr's
potential 180-day "first filer" exclusivity period, it would be entitled to
begin selling a generic olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon's
Pataday™ product in the
United States in June 2011.  Such competition would be expected to
impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
      
    
     
           
Alcon received notice on January 15, 2009 that Sandoz Inc. (an affiliate of
Novartis) has filed an ANDA challenging one of the patents underlying Alcon's
Patanol®
product.  Similar to the Apotex ANDA on Patanol®, the
Sandoz ANDA is challenging only the patent jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon, but
not the Kyowa-owned patent on olopatadine, which expires December 2010 (June
2011 with the pediatric extension).  Because the suit was filed within
the statutory 45-day period, the FDA must delay any approval of the Sandoz ANDA
for 30 months (until June 2011) unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the
court modifies the 30-month stay on FDA approval.  However, as a third
ANDA filer (behind both Apotex and Barr), Sandoz would not be entitled to
receive FDA approval until the expiration or forfeiture of a 180-day exclusivity
period that would be granted to Apotex (the first filer) if it were successful
in its patent challenge.  Trial has been scheduled for April 26, 2010,
and consolidation with the above-described Apotex suit (Patanol®)
has been ordered by the court.  Apotex has advised the court of recent
public statements of intent by Novartis to acquire all outstanding shares of
Alcon stock, and filed a motion to sever Sandoz from the trial.  On
February 22, 2010, the court granted the motion, ordering the suit against
Sandoz to proceed separately and confirming the April 26, 2010 trial date with
Apotex.  A new trial date for the Sandoz case has not yet been
set.  Subject to the possibility of the 180-day exclusivity period
that could accrue to Apotex, if Sandoz succeeds in overcoming the challenged
patent and secures FDA approval, it would be entitled to begin selling a generic
olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon's Patanol®
product in the United States in June 2011.  Such competition would be
expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.
    
    The
seventh ANDA patent suit was filed after Alcon received notice by letter dated
March 17, 2009, that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had filed a Paragraph IV
certification with its ANDA for a generic version of Alcon's TRAVATAN®
product containing 0.004% travoprost.  Barr is challenging the
following patents listed in the Orange Book for TRAVATAN®: U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,510,383; 5,631,287; 5,849,792; 5,889,052; and
6,011,062.  With the exception of the '383 patent, which expires in
2013, all of the patents will expire in December 2014.  Alcon filed
suit against Barr in the U.S. District Court in Delaware on April 30, 2009 and
thereby secured the statutory 30-month stay on FDA approval of the generic
product.  The FDA must delay any approval of the Barr ANDA until
September 2011, unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies
the 30-month stay on FDA approval.  This case has been consolidated
with the Par and Apotex cases on TRAVATAN®
described below.  Trial has been scheduled to commence March 7,
2011.  Should Barr succeed in overcoming all of the challenged patents
and secure FDA approval, it would be entitled to begin selling a generic
travoprost product that would compete with Alcon's TRAVATAN®
product in the United States.  Such competition would be expected to
impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    The
eighth patent suit was filed after Sandoz Canada Inc. (an affiliate of Novartis)
notified Alcon Canada by letter dated April 9, 2009, that Sandoz had filed an
Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) seeking approval from the Canadian
Minister of Health to market a generic version of Alcon's Patanol®
product.  The Sandoz ANDS is challenging only one of the two patents
listed in the Canadian Patent Register for the Patanol®
product.  The challenged patent (Canadian Patent No. 2,195,094) is
jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon and expires in May 2016.  Alcon and
Kyowa filed suit on May 25, 2009 in the Federal Court in Toronto, thereby
securing a 24-month delay (until May 25, 2011) in the regulatory approval from
the Minister of Health, which can only be shortened if the litigation is earlier
resolved or the court modifies the 24-month stay on such
approval.  Trial has not yet been scheduled in this
case.  Should Sandoz succeed in overcoming the challenged patent and
secure Minister of Health 
    
      
         

      
      
        57
         

      
      
         

      
    
     
    approval, it would be entitled to
begin selling a generic olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon's
Patanol®
product in Canada well before the patent expiration in 2016, but not before
expiration of the unchallenged patent in November 2012.  Such
competition would be expected to impact the Company's sales and profits.
     
    The ninth
ANDA patent suit was filed after Alcon received notice by letter dated June 1,
2009, that Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. had filed a Paragraph IV certification with
its two ANDAs for generic versions of Alcon's TRAVATAN®
and TRAVATAN Z® products.  Par
is challenging the following patents listed in the Orange Book for TRAVATAN®
and TRAVATAN Z®:  U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,510,383; 5,631,287; 5,849,792; 5,889,052; 6,011,062; 6,503,497;
and 6,849,253.  All of these patents will expire by the end of
2014.  On July 1, 2009, Alcon filed suit in the U.S. District Court in
Delaware, thereby securing a statutory stay under which the FDA must delay any
approval of the Par ANDAs until December 2011, unless the litigation is earlier
resolved or the court modifies the 30-month stay on FDA approval.  All
of the cases about TRAVATAN®
and TRAVATAN Z®
(Barr, Par and Apotex) have now been consolidated.  Trial has been
scheduled for March 7, 2011.  Subject to the possibility of the
180-day exclusivity period that could accrue to Barr (as first filer) relative
to the TRAVATAN® product, if Par
succeeds in overcoming all of the challenged patents and secures FDA approval,
it would be entitled to begin selling generic travoprost products that would
compete with Alcon's TRAVATAN
® and TRAVATAN Z®
products in the United States in December 2011.  Such
competition would be expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.
    
    The tenth
ANDA patent suit was filed after Alcon received notice by letter dated June 24,
2009, that Barr Laboratories, Inc. had filed a Paragraph IV certification with
its ANDA for a generic version of Alcon's TRAVATAN Z® product.  Barr
is challenging the following patents listed in the Orange Book for TRAVATAN Z®:  U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,510,383; 5,889,052; 6,503,497; and 6,849,253.  All of
the patents will expire by the end of 2014.  On July 13, 2009, Alcon
filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Delaware, thereby securing a statutory
stay under which the FDA must delay any approval of the Barr ANDA until December
2011, unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies the
30-month stay on FDA approval.  Trial has been scheduled for March 7,
2011 in this case, which has been consolidated with the above-described Barr
suit (TRAVATAN®)
and Par suit (TRAVATAN®
and TRAVATAN Z®)
and consolidated further to include the Apotex suit (TRAVATAN®)
described below.  Subject to the possibility of the 180-day
exclusivity period that could accrue to Par (as first filer) relative to the
TRAVATAN Z® product,
if Barr succeeds in overcoming all of the challenged patents and secures FDA
approval, it would be entitled to begin selling a generic travoprost product
that would compete with Alcon's TRAVATAN Z® product
in the United States in December 2011.  Such competition would be
expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    The
eleventh ANDA patent suit was filed after Alcon received notice by letter dated
September 11, 2009, that Apotex Corp. and Apotex Inc. had filed an ANDA for a
generic version of Alcon's TRAVATAN®
product.  Apotex is challenging all five of the Orange Book listed
patents for TRAVATAN®:
5,510,383; 5,631,287; 5,849,792; 5,889,052; and 6,011,062.  Alcon
filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Delaware, thereby securing a statutory
stay under which the FDA must delay any approval of the Barr ANDA until March
2012, unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies the
30-month stay on FDA approval.  This case has been consolidated with
the Barr and Par cases (TRAVATAN® and
TRAVATAN Z®) described
above.  Trial has been scheduled for March 7, 2011.  Subject
to the possibility of the 180-day exclusivity period that could accrue to Barr
(as first filer) relative to the TRAVATAN® product, if Apotex
succeeds in overcoming all of the challenged patents and secures FDA approval,
it would be entitled to begin selling a generic travoprost product that would
compete with Alcon's TRAVATAN
® product
in the United States in March 2012.  Such competition would be
expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    Alcon
received notice dated October 19, 2009, that Apotex Corp. and Apotex Inc. have
filed an ANDA challenging U.S. Patent No. 5,116,863, which covers Alcon's Patanase®
olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray solution. The patent, which is owned by
Alcon's raw material supplier, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., and licensed to
Alcon, has a term extended by regulatory exclusivity that expires October 15,
2011.  Alcon had until December 3, 2009, to file suit and avail itself
of the statutory stay on FDA approval of the ANDA.  Had suit been
filed by that date, the FDA could not have approved the Apotex ANDA for 30
months unless the litigation were earlier resolved or the court modified the
30-month stay on FDA approval.  In this case, however, the 30-month
period would be shortened to coincide with the expiration date of the challenged
patent in December 2010 and therefore would be
inconsequential.  Moreover, Alcon has regulatory exclusivity for the
Patanase®
product extending until October
2011.  Under these circumstances, Alcon and Kyowa elected not to file
suit.   Alcon also has additional pending 
    
      
        
           

        
        
          58
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
      patent applications that are potentially relevant to the Patanase®
product, which are not currently listed in the FDA Orange Book, and which have
not been challenged by Apotex.  These pending applications may or may
not issue and may not cover the Patanase®
product.   Should Apotex succeed in securing FDA approval and
overcoming the challenged
patent and any other applicable patents that may issue, it would be entitled to
immediately begin selling a generic olopatadine product that would compete with
Alcon's Patanase®
product in the United States.  Such competition would be expected to
impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    
    The
twelfth ANDA patent suit was filed after Alcon received notice on December 15,
2009 that Sandoz Inc. (an affiliate of Novartis), had filed an ANDA with a
Paragraph IV certification directed to the Alcon and Kyowa patents on Pataday™.  The
Sandoz ANDA is challenging the patent jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon
(described above), as well as two later issued patents owned by Alcon that cover
the Pataday™
formulation.  Of the two Alcon patents, the latest expiry date is
November 2023.  Sandoz is not challenging the Kyowa patent on
olopatadine that expires in December 2010 (effectively extended until June 2011
by a pediatric extension).  On January 27, 2010, Alcon and Kyowa filed
suit in the Federal District Court in Indianapolis.  Because the suit
was filed within the statutory 45-day period, the FDA must delay any approval of
the Sandoz ANDA for 30 months (until June 2012) unless the litigation is earlier
resolved or the court modifies the 30-month stay on FDA
approval.  However, because Sandoz is the third filer (behind both
Barr and Apotex) and subject to a potential 180-day exclusivity period of the
first filer, the 30-month stay is of no practical
consequence.  Subject to the possibility of the 180-day exclusivity
period that potentially could accrue to Barr (as first filer) relative to the
Pataday™ product, if
Sandoz were to succeed in overcoming all the challenged patents and to secure
FDA approval, it would be entitled to begin selling a generic product that would
compete with Alcon's Pataday™ product in the
United States.  Such competition would be expected to impact
significantly the Company's sales and profits.
     
    
             
The thirteenth ANDA patent was filed after Alcon received notice that Wockhardt
Limited (headquartered in India) has filed an ANDA with a Paragraph IV
certification for a generic version of Alcon's Patanol®
product.  Wockhardt is challenging U.S. Patent No. 5,641,805, which is
jointly owned by Alcon and its raw material supplier, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co.,
Ltd.  The challenged patent will expire in
2015.   Wockhardt is not challenging, however, another
Kyowa-owned U.S. patent covering Patanol®,
which expires on December 18, 2010 (effectively extended until June 2011 by a
pediatric extension).  Consequently, Wockhardt's generic challenge
poses no threat to the Patanol®
product market prior to June 2011.  Alcon and Kyowa filed suit against
Wockhardt in the Federal District Court in Indianapolis on February 12, 2010, to
avail themselves of the statutory 30-month stay on FDA approval of the proposed
generic product.  That 30-month period will expire August 2, 2012,
unless the litigation is earlier resolved or the court modifies the 30-month
stay on FDA approval.  However, as a third ANDA filer (behind both
Apotex and Sandoz), Wockhardt would not be entitled to receive FDA approval
until the expiration or forfeiture of a 180-day exclusivity period that would be
granted to Apotex (the first filer) if it were successful in its patent
challenge.  Subject to the possibility of such a 180-day exclusivity
period that could potentially accrue to Apotex (as first filer) relative to the
Patanol®
product, if Wockhardt were to succeed in overcoming the challenged patent and to
secure FDA approval, it would be entitled to begin selling a generic product
that would compete with Alcon's Patanol®
product in the United States.  Such competition would be expected to
impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    
    By letter
dated February 24, 2010, Apotex, Inc. notified Alcon Canada that Apotex had
filed an ANDS seeking approval from the Canadian Minister of Health to market a
generic version of Alcon's Patanol®
product.  The Apotex ANDS is challenging only one of the two patents
listed in the Canadian Patent Register for the Patanol®
product.  The challenged patent (Canadian Patent No. 2,195,094) is
jointly owned by Kyowa and Alcon and expires in May 2016.  Alcon and
Kyowa will have fifty days from the date of the notice letter to file suit and
secure a 24-month delay (until April 2012) in the regulatory approval from the
Minister of Health, which can only be shortened if the litigation is earlier
resolved or the court modifies the 24-month stay on such
approval.  Should Apotex succeed in overcoming the challenged patent
and secure Minister of Health approval, it would be entitled to begin selling a
generic olopatadine product that would compete with Alcon’s Patanol®
product in Canada well before the patent expiration in 2016, but not before
expiration of the unchallenged patent in November 2012.  Such
competition would be expected to impact the Company's sales and
profits.
    
    Alcon is
also enforcing patents against generic challengers in China (Patanol®) and
Chile (Vigamox®).

        On April
16, 2008, Synergetics USA, Inc., a microsurgical device company, filed a civil
antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York against the Company and its subsidiary, Alcon Laboratories,
Inc.  Synergetics asserts that it has suffered losses resulting from
alleged unlawful/unfair practices and seeks a
recovery that it claims could exceed $100.  Synergetics alleges that
Alcon has used monopoly power in the market for vitreoretinal surgical equipment
to control purchasing decisions in favor of its surgical illumination sources
and associated accessories, and that Alcon has done this to the detriment of
sales of Synergetics's products, particularly its line of light sources, light
pipes and other accessories.  Synergetics also asserts that Alcon
engaged in allegedly anti-competitive behavior.  On June 23, 2008, the
Company filed its answer and counterclaim in the district
court.  Synergetics subsequently amended its original Complaint, and
on October 14, 2008, the Company filed its Motion to Dismiss Synergetics's First
Amended Complaint.  On February 12, 2009, Synergetics filed a Motion
for Summary Judgment relative to the Company's counterclaims.  On
February 23, 2009, the court granted the Company's Motions to Dismiss based on
Synergetics's failure to properly plead its claims.  On March 6, 2009,
Synergetics filed a Second Amended Complaint.  The Company then filed
another Motion to Dismiss directed to the Second Amended
Complaint.  That motion was granted in-part and denied in-part on June
4, 2009.  On July 9, 2009, the court granted Synergetics's Motion for
Summary Judgment on the Company's counterclaims.  The Company believes
that it has strong defenses to Synergetics's claims, but both parties have
requested a stay of the litigation to allow settlement discussions to
proceed.
      
    
    
    A
subsidiary of the Company, Alcon Research, Ltd., filed a Complaint on October 9,
2008 against Synergetics USA, Inc. for patent infringement of U.S. Patent No.
5,603,710, entitled, "Laser Delivery System with Soft Tip."  The suit
was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Fort
Worth.  The Complaint asserts that Synergetics has knowingly and
willfully infringed the Company's patent, which is directed to ophthalmic laser
delivery systems having a probe with a soft tip.  In addition to
seeking actual and exemplary monetary damages relating to the willful patent
infringement and injunctive relief to prevent Synergetics from continuing its
infringement of the patent, the Company is requesting that the district court
award the Company its attorneys' fees and costs.  Synergetics has
answered the Complaint and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of
non-infringement and patent invalidity.  No trial date has been
set.  An adverse ruling by the court, while possible, would not be
expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    On
February 25, 2009, the Company, together with subsidiaries Alcon Laboratories,
Inc. and Alcon Research, Ltd., filed a second suit against Synergetics in the
U.S. District Court in Fort Worth.  This case alleges infringement of
Alcon's U.S. Patent 5,318,560 directed to aspirating laser probes, as well as
trademark infringement and unfair competition relating to Synergetics's
unauthorized use of Alcon's marks (ALCON®,
Accurus®, and
Grieshaber®) on
its website.  On March 20, 2009, these claims were added to an amended
complaint in the '710 patent suit described immediately above, effectively
merging the two suits.  An adverse ruling by the court, while
possible, would not be expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.  Synergetics requested that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office reexamine both patents-in-suit and filed a motion to stay the litigation
pending a decision by the Patent Office.  On September 18, 2009, the
court granted the motion to stay the litigation.  Alcon filed a motion
for reconsideration but this motion was denied on November 23,
2009.  In view of ongoing settlement discussions, mentioned above, no
appeal has been filed.
    
    On
December 18, 2008, James M. Nielsen, M.D. filed a patent infringement suit
against Alcon, Inc. and Alcon Laboratories, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Texas in Dallas.  Dr. Nielsen is asserting
that his U.S. Patent No. 5,158,572 entitled "Multifocal Intraocular Lens" is
being infringed by the Company's AcrySof® ReSTOR® intraocular
lens.  The patent, which expired at the end of October 2009, was
previously licensed to Advanced Medical Optics, Inc.  Alcon filed its
Answer January 12, 2009.  The Answer included a counterclaim for a
declaratory judgment that the patent-in-suit is invalid and not
infringed.  The case has been set for trial in August,
2010.  An adverse ruling by the court, while possible, would not be
expected to impact significantly the Company's sales and profits.
    
    On
January 22, 2009, Elan Pharma International Ltd. sued two of the Company's
subsidiaries, Alcon Laboratories, Inc. and Alcon Research, Ltd., in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Sherman, alleging
infringement of two Elan patents on nanoparticle technology (U.S. Patent Nos.
5,298,262 and 5,429,842).  The complaint claims that the Company's
Azopt®
product and, potentially, other products infringe the two
patents.  The Company answered and counterclaimed on May 12,
2009.  Elan then moved to dismiss certain of the 
    
      
        
           

        
        
          60
           

        
        
           

        
      
       
      Company's
affirmative defenses and counterclaims.  The Company has filed an
amended answer and counterclaims providing greater detail with respect to the
Company's inequitable conduct counterclaims.  The case has been set
for trial
March 21, 2011.  The Company believes that it has strong defenses and
intends to defend itself vigorously.  An adverse ruling by the court,
however, could impact significantly the Company's sales and
profits.
    
    
    The
Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of other legal proceedings
arising out of the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating
to product liability and patent infringement.  The Company believes
that it has valid defenses and is vigorously defending the litigation pending
against it.
    
    While the
results of the aforementioned contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
results of operations.  Litigation contingencies are subject to change
based on settlements and court decisions.
    
    The
Company may be subject to future litigation and infringement claims, which could
cause the Company to incur significant expenses or prevent the Company from
selling its products.  The Company operates in an industry susceptible
to significant product liability claims.  Product liability claims may
be asserted against the Company in the future arising out of events not known to
the Company at the present time.
    
    The
Company self-insures through captive insurance subsidiaries almost all of its
property and casualty, business interruption and liability risks.
    
    The Company was self-insured through
its captive insurance subsidiary for damages incurred prior to 2006 at one of
its sales and distribution facilities and was involved in legal proceedings to
seek recovery of its losses and other incremental operating costs from the third
parties responsible for the damages.  In December 2008, the captive
insurance subsidiary settled its claim against the third parties
involved.  Since no recovery had been recorded previously, the Company
recognized a gain in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the settlement of $15
($3 in cost of goods sold and $12 in selling, general and administration
expenses).
    
    In the
normal course of business, the Company has entered into research and development
arrangements with third parties that require milestone and royalty payments to
the third parties contingent upon certain future events linked to the success of
the research and development efforts.
    
    In order
to receive an expedited return of assets held by Lehman Brothers International
(Europe) (in administration) as discussed in note 15, Alcon has agreed to return
any assets which the Joint Administrators determine should not have been
disbursed in settlement.  The amount of any funds to be returned, if
any, would result from the determination by the Joint Administrators that the
rights of another claimant in the proceeding have precedence over the Company's
claim.
    
    Commitments
    
    The
Company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating
leases.  The total costs of operating leases (inclusive of any
adjustments associated with escalating rent, rent holidays, contingent rent or
rent concessions) are expensed ratably over the life of the operating
lease.  Leasehold incentives are capitalized and amortized over the
shorter of the life of the lease or the associated asset.  Lease
expense incurred was $66, $77 and $60 during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  Future minimum aggregate lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases with a term of more than one year were as
follows:

of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and
conditions.  Additionally, the Company guaranteed $33 to a third party
reinsurer for the Company's captive insurance subsidiaries.

    ESBATech AG
    
    Acquisition
in 2009
    
    On
September 15, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of ESBATech AG, a
Swiss biotechnology company. Alcon paid ESBATech shareholders $150 in cash at
closing. In addition, the Company recorded the estimated fair value of possible
contingent payments of up to $439 based upon the achievement of future research
and development milestones that would be expected to create value for Alcon.
ESBATech is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that has been developing a
pipeline of proprietary single-chain antibody fragment therapeutics for topical
and local delivery for safe and convenient therapy. This acquisition provides
the Company with additional research and development capabilities.

    The
Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the
estimated fair values of in process research and development, identifiable
intangible assets and certain tangible assets as well as the future contingent
payments.  Such a valuation requires significant estimates and
assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated
costs to complete the in process projects, projecting regulatory approvals,
estimating future cash flows, and developing appropriate discount
rates.  The Company is continuing to obtain information and evaluate
these fair value estimates.  The Company's fair value estimates for
these components of the transaction may change during the allowable allocation
period, which is typically up to one year from the acquisition
date.
    
    Fair
Values of Future Contingent Payments
    
    In
addition to the cash paid to the shareholders of ESBATech at the time of the
acquisition, the Company is obligated to make contingent payments of up to $439
based upon the achievement of future research and development milestones that
would be expected to create value for Alcon. The fair values of these payments
were estimated to be $71 and were included as a cost of the
acquisition.
    
    There are
a number of milestones that could potentially lead to such payments to the
former shareholders of ESBATech.  This valuation was based on the
Company's estimates of the probability and timing of these contingent payments.
The fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the
market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement, as described in note
6.  Each milestone was assigned a probability based on its current
status.  The resultant probability-weighted cash flows were then
discounted using a discount rate of 6%, which the Company believes is
appropriate and representative of a market participant
assumption.  The probabilities assigned to payment streams ranged from
5% to 39%.  An increase or decrease of 10 percentage points in the
probability assumptions would result in an adjustment to the estimated value of
approximately $30.
    
    The fair
values of these contingent payments will be reviewed on a periodic
basis.  Any future changes in this estimated value not associated with
the original purchase price valuation will be recorded in the Company's results
of operations.
    
    Purchase
Price Allocation
    
    The
allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires use of accounting
estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable
tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and
development, and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values.  Additionally, the Company must determine whether an acquired
entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets, because a portion
of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in connection with the
acquisition of a business.  The Company believes that ESBATech's use
of inputs and processes qualify it as the acquisition of a
business.
    
    The
ESBATech purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition
date.
    
    The
valuation of these assets requires significant estimates and assumptions
including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to
complete the in process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating
future cash flows, and developing appropriate discount rates.
    
    The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was
allocated to goodwill.

    The
Company's fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change
during the allowable allocation period, which is typically up to one year from
the acquisition date.
    
    Identifiable
Intangible Assets
    
    Acquired
identifiable intangible assets include rights for the use of proprietary
technologies for the development of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.  The
estimated amortization period is 20 years based on the projected useful life of
the products developed by the use of the technology.
    
    The
estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined based on
the use of a discounted cash flow model using an income approach for products
developed from the acquired technology.  Estimated revenues were
probability adjusted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks
surrounding successful development and commercialization.  The
estimated after-tax cash flows were then discounted to a present value using
discount rates appropriate for the risks associated with these
projects.
    
    In
Process Research and Development
    
    In
conjunction with the ESBATech acquisition, the Company allocated $104 of the
acquisition price to acquire in process research and development
assets.
    
    These in
process research and development assets are comprised of projects to develop
technologies in the field of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.  These assets
were in an early stage of development as of the ESBATech acquisition date of
September 15, 2009.
    
    The
estimated fair value of the in process research and development assets was
determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model using an income
approach for the acquired technologies.  Estimated revenues were
probability adjusted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks
surrounding successful development and commercialization.  The
estimated after-tax cash flows were then discounted to a present value using
discount rates appropriate for the risks associated with these
projects.
    
    The major
risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of
the acquired in process projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety
and efficacy of the technology based on further research, the data from clinical
trials, if necessary, and obtaining necessary regulatory
approvals.  No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions
used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the
projects will materialize as estimated, if at all.  For these reasons,
among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated
results.

    Goodwill
    
    Goodwill
represents the excess of the ESBATech purchase price over the sum of the amounts
assigned to assets acquired less liabilities assumed. The Company believes that
the acquisition of ESBATech provides the Company access to improved technology
and a highly trained ESBATech work force as of the acquisition
date.
    
    The
Company believes that these factors support the $40 of goodwill recognized as a
result of the purchase price paid for ESBATech. The goodwill was allocated
between the two business segments based on the acquisition models' projected
revenues, as shown in note 7, "Intangible Assets and Goodwill."  The
goodwill acquired in the ESBATech acquisition is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes.
    
    WaveLight
AG
    
    Initial
Acquisition in 2007
    
    On
November 9, 2007, the Company acquired 77.4% of the common shares of WaveLight
AG ("WaveLight").  WaveLight, a German company listed in Deutsche
Börse AG's Prime Standard since January 2003, develops, manufactures and markets
innovative refractive laser and diagnostic systems, including the ALLEGRETTO™ laser
system for refractive eye surgery.  This acquisition combined
WaveLight technological expertise and the ALLEGRETTO™ laser
with the Company's global marketing, distribution and service platform, together
providing additional clinical solutions and laser technology to better support
cataract and refractive customers.
    
    Purchase
Price Allocation
    
    The
allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of
accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the
identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process
research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values.  Additionally, the Company must determine whether an acquired
entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets, because a portion
of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business
combination.
    
    Although
the closing of the WaveLight acquisition was completed on November 9, 2007, the
acquisition date was effective as of November 1, 2007 for purposes of recording
the transaction and reporting WaveLight's results of operations in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.  The WaveLight purchase price was
allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
    
    The Company engaged an independent
third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the estimated fair values
of in process research and development, identifiable intangible assets and
certain tangible assets.  Such a valuation requires significant
estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to determining the timing
and estimated costs to complete the in process projects, projecting regulatory
approvals, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount
rates.
    
    The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, less
liabilities assumed, was allocated to goodwill.  The Company believes
that the acquisition of WaveLight will produce increased market presence and
opportunities, enhanced product mix and improved technology.  The goodwill
acquired in the WaveLight acquisition is not deductible for tax
purposes.
    
    The
Company believes that these primary factors support the amount of goodwill
recognized as a result of the purchase price paid for WaveLight, in relation to
other acquired tangible and intangible assets, including in process research and
development.
    
    The
Company believes the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were based on reasonable assumptions.  The

    In
Process Research and Development
    
    In
conjunction with the WaveLight acquisition, the Company recorded a charge to in
process research and development expense of $9 for acquired in process research
and development assets that the Company determined were not yet complete and had
no alternative future uses in their current state.
    
    The
estimated fair value of the in process research and development assets was
determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow model for
the acquired technologies.  Estimated revenues took into account the
stage of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and
commercialization.  The estimated after-tax cash flows were then
discounted to a present value using discount rates appropriate for the risks
associated with these projects.
    
    Acquired
identifiable intangible assets include product rights for approved indications
of currently marketed products, customer relationships, trademarks and core
technology for laser and other refractive products.  The amounts will
be amortized over periods from 5 to 10 years, with a weighted average of life of
6 years.
    
    Impairment
evaluations in the future for acquired developed technology will occur at a
consolidated cash flow level within the Company's refractive product
line.
    
    Adjustments
to 2007 Transaction
    
    During
the first quarter of 2008, Alcon recorded additional transaction costs in the
amount of $2 related to the 2007 acquisition of WaveLight. This amount was
recorded as additional goodwill.  In addition, during the third
quarter of 2008, Alcon increased its valuation adjustment for the deferred tax
assets acquired in 2007 with a resulting increase of $3 to
goodwill.
    
    The
following table summarizes the impact of the adjustments to the 2007
transaction:

    2008 Acquisition of Additional
WaveLight Shares
    
    During

    2009
Acquisition of Remaining WaveLight Shares
    
    On March
4, 2009, a Domination Agreement was registered and became
effective.  The Domination Agreement allowed Alcon to instruct
WaveLight with regard to operational and financial matters, as well as the
efficient integration of both companies.  In October 2009, the German
requirements were met to complete the acquisition of the outstanding minority
shares of WaveLight AG and the listing of such shares was
terminated.  As a result, WaveLight AG became wholly owned by the
Company.  Seventy-nine shareholders have filed applications for
appraisal proceedings against the Company relative to the cash compensation
offered in the Domination Agreement.  A defense writ was filed on
November 13, 2009.

        Report of
the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements to the General
Meeting of
Shareholders of
        
        Alcon,
Inc., Hünenberg
        
          
            
          
      
      
      As
statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial
statements (consolidated balance
sheets, consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated statements of
shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, consolidated statements of cash
flows and notes) of Alcon, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended
December 31, 2009, as included in the Alcon, Inc. 2009 Financial Report on pages
8 to 68 and the Swiss disclosure requirements on pages 71 to 73.
      
      Board
of Directors’ Responsibility
      The board
of directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the
consolidation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. This
responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal
control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The
board of directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate
accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the
circumstances.
      
      Auditor’s
Responsibility
      Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss
law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
      
      An audit
involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the
internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
      
      Opinion
      In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2009 comply with Swiss law and the consolidation and valuation principles as set
out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

      Report
on Other Legal Requirements
      
      We
confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the
Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA)
and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our
independence.
      
      In
accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard
890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed
for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the
instructions of the board of directors.
      
      We
recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be
approved.

our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss
Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
      
      An audit
involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system
relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
      
      Opinion
      In our
opinion, the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 comply
with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation.

      The
Company appropriates earnings to a legal reserve in accordance with the
provisions of Swiss law. For holding companies such a reserve is, to the extent
of 20% of the share capital, not readily available for
distribution.
      
      As a
result of 336,984 (2008: 644,378) new shares issued during 2009, the legal
reserve increased by CHF 11,822,042 (2008: CHF 23,579,424).

      During
the year a total of 81,458 (2008: 1,063,537) shares, including 1,216 (2008:
1,176) shares for a deferred compensation plan, were acquired by Alcon, Inc. and
subsidiaries at a cost of CHF 8,995,077 (2008: CHF 145,248,766). 675,557 (2008:
1,420,196) shares, whereof 29,919 (2008: 15,390) related to a deferred
compensation plan, were disposed and the reserve was reduced by CHF 66,569,715
(2008: 136,743,459) representing the historical average cost price of these
shares. Additionally, 1,043,400 (2008: 7,657,400) shares under the share
repurchase program were cancelled and the reserve was adjusted at the share's
purchase price of CHF 141,994,080 (2008: 1,220,202,516).
      
      No (2008:
1,043,400) shares under the share repurchase program have been acquired in
2009.
      
      The total
of 4,583,737 (2008: 6,221,236) own shares, including 118,180 (2008: 146,883)
shares for a deferred compensation plan, held on December 31, 2009, represents
1.5% (2008: 2.0%) of Alcon, Inc.’s share capital. These shares will be recorded
in the Share Register as being without voting rights and will not rank for
dividend. Shares for a deferred compensation plan have no voting rights but rank
for dividend.
      
      At
December 31, 2009 the shareholding of a Group company was 4,446,616 (2008:

      Cancellation
              
            
      
      
      In 2009,
no shares were repurchased for cancellation as the share repurchase program was
stopped.
      
      On May 5,
2009, the Company's shareholders approved the cancellation of 1,043,400 Alcon
common shares, which the Company purchased during 2008.  After the
fulfillment of certain formal Swiss law requirements, the cancellation became
effective in August 2009.
      
      
        

              (b)    
              
                Share
      Repurchase Agreement Terminated
              
            
      
      
      In March
2008, as a result of the then-pending agreement between Nestlé and Novartis
discussed above, the Company halted the purchase of Alcon common shares in the
open market under all share repurchase programs, and terminated the pro rata
share repurchase agreement that it had entered into following the December 2007
authorization by the board of directors of the share repurchase program that
provided for the purchase of up to USD 1,100 million of Alcon common
shares.  Prior to its termination, the Company had purchased a total
of 150,000 shares under the agreement, comprised of 112,500 shares from the
Company's majority shareholder, Nestlé, and 37,500 shares from the market, for a
total of USD 20 million. The price for the shares purchased from Nestlé under
the agreement was equal to the volume-weighted average price for such shares
determined in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934.
      
      The
program authorized in December 2007 was in addition to the Company's
pre-existing share repurchase program, under which, as of December 31, 2008, the
Company had remaining authorization to purchase up to 1.8 million
shares.  In April 2008, the Company halted the purchase of Alcon
common shares in the open market under all share repurchase programs. In
September 2008, the Company continued to purchase from the public under the
pre-existing program up to 1 million Alcon common shares to be presented to the
shareholders for retirement. Neither Nestlé nor Novartis participated in this
program and their ownership interests did not change materially as a result of
these share repurchases.

      On April
6, 2008, Nestlé and Novartis AG ("Novartis") executed the Purchase and Option
Agreement pursuant to which Nestlé agreed to sell approximately 74 million of
its shares of Alcon common stock to Novartis in a cash transaction at a price of
$143.18 per share.  This sale was consummated on July 7, 2008, and
Novartis now owns a minority stake in Alcon of slightly less than 25% of Alcon's
outstanding shares, while Nestlé remains Alcon's majority shareholder with
approximately 156 million Alcon shares comprising approximately 52% of the
Company's outstanding shares.

      The
Purchase and Option Agreement between Nestlé and Novartis also contains put and
call option rights on the balance of approximately 156 million Alcon shares
owned by Nestlé.  The option rights commenced on January 1, 2010 and
expire on July 31, 2011.  As outlined by the two parties, these rights
grant (i) Novartis a call option to buy all but 4.1 million (or 2.5%) of
Nestlé's remaining Alcon shares at a fixed price of $181 per share and the 4.1
million shares at the first stage price of $143.18 per share, and (ii) Nestlé a
put option to sell to Novartis all but 4.1 million of its remaining Alcon shares
to Novartis at the lower of Novartis's call price of $181 per share or a premium
of approximately 20.5% above the then-market price of Alcon shares, which will
be calculated as the average market price of Alcon shares during the five
trading days immediately preceding the exercise date of the put option, with the
4.1 million share balance to be sold at the first stage closing price of $143.18
per share.
      
      On
January 4, 2010, Novartis announced that it had exercised its option to purchase
the remaining approximately 156 million Alcon shares owned by Nestlé at a
weighted average price of $180 per share in cash, pursuant to the Purchase and
Option Agreement.  Upon consummation of the purchase, Novartis would
own an approximate 77% interest in Alcon.
      
      The
consummation of a purchase and sale transaction under the option right is
subject to regulatory approvals.  The consummation would trigger
certain change of control provisions in the Company's share-based awards plan
(including the vesting of certain outstanding share-based awards), certain
retirement plans for Company employees and other agreements.
      
      Upon
consummation, the Company will no longer benefit from certain synergies as a
result of Nestlé's ownership.  Alcon has taken advantage of the
synergies in several functional areas.  Management does not anticipate
a significant financial impact to Alcon due to the loss of these synergies
because the Company is currently negotiating with certain vendors/suppliers and
financial services providers to mitigate any potential impact from a change of
control.  However, no assurances can be made at this
time.
      
      As a
result of Novartis's planned acquisition of Nestlé's remaining Alcon shares,
Alcon's relationships with third parties in the pharmaceutical and other
industries may be impacted, which in some cases may affect Alcon's business
development and licensing opportunities.
      
      Novartis
also announced that it submitted to the Alcon board of directors a proposal for
a merger of Alcon with and into Novartis to be effected under Swiss merger
law.  Under the terms of the merger proposal, holders of the
approximate 23% of Alcon shares that are publicly traded would receive 2.8
Novartis shares for each Alcon share.  The proposed merger would be
contingent upon, among other things, approval by the Alcon board of directors,
the closing of the purchase and sale transaction related to the Novartis option
exercise as well as receipt of required regulatory approvals.  Upon
Novartis becoming a majority shareholder of Alcon, management believes that the
Organizational Regulations provide that the Alcon board of directors may only
approve the proposed merger if a majority of the Independent Director Committee
so recommends: however, management cannot predict the outcome of any judicial
proceeding that might be initiated to interpret or challenge this
position.

      The
Independent Director Committee was formed in 2008 in connection with Novartis's
initial purchase of slightly less than 25% of the Alcon shares from Nestlé to
evaluate transactions such as the merger proposed by Novartis.  The
Independent Director Committee engaged independent financial and legal advisors
in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger.  On January
20, 2010, the Independent Director Committee issued its formal response
rejecting the Novartis merger proposal.  The committee rejected the
merger proposal based on its assessment that the price offered and other terms
were not acceptable and that Novartis's merger proposal was not in the best
interests of Alcon and its minority shareholders.
      
         
Shareholder Agreement
      
      On April
6, 2008, Nestlé and Novartis also executed the Shareholders Agreement that
provides for the expansion of the Alcon board of directors from eight to ten
members upon the completion of this sale, with one of the additional members
designated by Nestlé and one
      designated
by Novartis. Alcon's shareholders voted to expand the Alcon board and elected
two new directors at Alcon's annual general meeting held on May 6, 2008 in Zug,
Switzerland.  James Singh, Nestlé's executive vice president and chief
financial officer and Nestlé's designee, and Daniel Vasella, M.D., chairman and
chief executive officer of Novartis and Novartis' designee, were elected to
these two director positions and joined Alcon's board upon the closing of the 74
million share sale transaction on July 7, 2008.

group-wide Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) process. The ERM process is
applied in strategy setting across the Alcon Group and designed to identify
potential events that may affect entities and manage risks within Group
tolerances. Regular reporting is provided to the Board of Directors and Audit

Strategy and Business Development Department and is applicable to all Group's
facilities and operations including corporate functions such as Financial
Reporting, Treasury, Income Taxes, Legal, and Information

B)  COMPENSATION
      
      
      We
provide our board of directors with compensation and benefits that will attract
and retain qualified directors.  In 2009, all members of our board of
directors, except for our President and Chief Executive Officer, received an
annual cash retainer of $85,000 with an additional $15,000 for the audit
committee chairperson and an additional $10,000 for each chairperson of the
compensation, nominating/corporate governance and independent director
committees.  We refer to a director who is neither a member of
Nestlé's board of directors nor a full-time employee of Nestlé or Alcon as a
non-employee director.  In accordance with the service contract
discussed below, Mr. Rayment also received additional cash compensation of
$217,500 for serving as non-executive chairman of our board.
      
      In 2009,
the numbers of share-settled stock appreciation rights ("SSARs") and restricted
share units awarded to non-employee directors were determined by multiplying
$125,000 by 50% for SSARs and by 50% for restricted share units.  The
50% portion for SSARs was divided by the expected Black-Scholes value of an
option to purchase one common share on the date of grant.  The 50%
portion for restricted share units was determined using the discounted value of
one common share on the date of grant.  Each of the non-employee
directors was awarded 3,150 SSARs and 700 restricted share units in
2009.  In 2010, we expect to award our non-employee directors 100%
restricted share units. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
our directors did not receive any other compensation or benefits-in-kind from
Alcon, Inc. except as noted above and, with respect to Mr. Rayment and Mr.
Buehler, as noted below.
      
      We have
service contracts with two of our directors.  Alcon entered into a
service agreement with Cary Rayment commencing April 1, 2009 under which he
continues to serve as a director and the non-executive chairman of the board
after his retirement as President and Chief Executive Officer of Alcon, Inc.
effective March 31, 2009.  Kevin Buehler was named President and Chief
Executive Officer of Alcon, Inc. and Alcon Laboratories, Inc. effective April 1,
2009 and has an employment agreement with Alcon Laboratories, Inc.  In
addition, Timothy R.G. Sear, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
will continue to be provided an office by the Company through May
2010.
      
      During
2009, the executive officers received a combination of SSARs, restricted share
units and performance share units from Alcon, Inc. as indicated in this
Compensation section.  In 2010, we expect to grant our executive
officers 100% restricted share units.
      
      The
following compensation table sets forth information regarding compensation and
benefits-in-kind paid during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008
to the directors of Alcon, Inc.

                SSARs
      were granted in 2009 and 2008 pursuant to the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive
      Plan. The value shown is based on the Black-Scholes model of option
      valuation to determine grant date "fair value". The actual value, if any,
      that may be realized will depend on the excess of the stock price over the
      exercise price on the date the SSAR is exercised, so there is no assurance
      the value realized will be at or near the value estimated by this model.
      The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes model for 2009:
      expected volatility, 31.5%; risk-free interest rate, 2.15%; dividend
      yield, 3.0%; expected life, 5
years.

                Restricted

      grant date.
              
            
      
      
      In 2009
and 2008, no compensations were paid directly or indirectly to persons closely
related to a member of the board of directors by the Company or one of its
subsidiaries.
      
      There
were no compensations paid directly or indirectly to former members of the board
of directors.

                SSARs
      were granted in 2009 and 2008 pursuant to the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive
      Plan.  In general, these share-based instruments will vest in
      full on the third anniversary of the date of grant, or upon a
      participant's death or permanent disability.  Where the
      termination of employment is due to retirement, vesting will occur
      according to the normal vesting schedule.  Upon the involuntary
      termination of a participant's employment with Alcon (not as a result of
      disability or death), all vested instruments will be exercisable for 30
      days following the date of the involuntary termination. After the 30-day
      period, all unvested and unexercised instruments will be
      forfeited.  Where the termination of employment is due to death
      or disability, the instruments vest and may be exercisable for 60 months
      not to exceed the remaining term.  Upon voluntary termination,
      all unvested and vested unexercised instruments will be
      forfeited.

                The
      value shown is based on the Black-Scholes model of option valuation to
      determine grant date "fair value". The actual value, if any, that may be
      realized will depend on the excess of the stock price over the exercise
      price on the date the SSAR is exercised, so there is no assurance the
      value realized will be at or near the value estimated by this
      model.  The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes
      model for 2009: expected volatility, 31.5%; risk-free interest rate,
      1.65%; dividend yield, 3.0%; expected life, 5
  years.

      Amended
2002 Alcon Incentive Plan
      
      Eligibility
and Award Limits
      
      Our
employees and non-employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries and
affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive
Plan.  Employees of Nestlé and its subsidiaries other than Alcon
entities are not eligible to receive awards under this plan.
      
      Under the
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, limits are placed on the maximum award
amounts that may be granted to any employee in any plan/calendar
year.  The maximum number of shares subject to stock options/stock
appreciation rights that may be issued to any participant during any calendar
year shall not exceed 750,000.  The maximum number of shares that may
be issued to any participant as restricted shares during any calendar year shall
not exceed 200,000.
      
      Administration
      
      The
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee
of our board of directors, which has the authority to recommend and set the
terms and conditions of the grant awards.  Our board of directors is
responsible for approving the recommendations of the compensation
committee.
      
      For our
employees who are not considered executive officers, the compensation committee
may delegate its authority under the Alcon Incentive Plan to our executive
officers, subject to certain guidelines.

      Shares
Reserved for Awards
      
      Under the
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, a total of up to 40.0 million common shares
may be issued for awards.  Through December 31, 2009, approximately
17.6 million of these common shares had been issued under this
plan.
      
      Our board
of directors has the authority to make appropriate adjustments to the number as
well as to the terms of outstanding awards, in the event of any transaction that
affects our common shares such as share splits, share dividends or other similar
events.
      
      Awards of
stock options that expire unexercised, stock appreciation rights or restricted
shares that are forfeited under the terms of this plan or stock appreciation
rights that are exercised for cash are not included when determining the maximum
limit for our common shares available for grant under this plan.
      
      Annual
and Long Term Incentive Awards
      
      Annual
and long term incentive awards may be granted under the Amended 2002 Alcon
Incentive Plan.  The awards are considered earned only if corporate,
business segment or performance goals over the performance period satisfy the
conditions established by the compensation committee and approved by our board
of directors.  The performance objectives, which may vary from
employee to employee, are based on one or more financial measures and additional
non-financial measures.
      
      Our board
of directors determines whether awards are paid in the form of cash, common
shares or any combination of these items.
      
      Under the
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, selected executive officers may be awarded
performance-based incentive awards, subject to a maximum limit.

      Stock
Options
      
      Under the
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan, we may grant to eligible employees stock
options that are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock
options.  To date, the stock options granted have been nonqualified
stock options, which do not and will not qualify as incentive stock options for
federal income tax purposes under Section 422 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended.
      
      The
compensation committee will recommend to our board of directors for approval the
number and type of stock options to grant, as well as the exercise price,
applicable vesting schedule, option term and any applicable performance
criteria. Unless otherwise decided by our board of directors, stock options will
vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant, or on an option
holder's death, permanent disability or retirement (as defined in the Amended
2002 Alcon Incentive Plan).  Beginning with awards granted in 2006,
vesting of stock option awards will not be accelerated upon the option holder's
retirement, but will vest according to the regular vesting
schedule.  Upon the involuntary termination of an option holder's
employment with us, all vested options will be exercisable for 30 days;
provided, however, that where the termination of employment is due to (i)
retirement or (ii) death or disability, they may be exercisable for their
remaining term, or for 60 months not to exceed the remaining term,
respectively.  Some vesting requirements have been modified in
accordance with local laws and the approval of the board.  Upon
voluntary termination of employment, all options (vested and unvested) forfeit
on the date of termination.  The grant price for any stock option will
be not less than the fair market value of our common shares on the grant date,
unless approved by our board of directors.  Unless our board of
directors provides for a different period, stock options will have a term of ten
years.

      Stock
Appreciation Rights
      
      We may
grant stock appreciation rights, which will entitle the holder to receive an
amount equal to the difference between the fair market value and the grant
price.  The compensation committee will recommend to our board of
directors for approval the number of stock appreciation rights to grant, as well
as the exercise price, applicable vesting schedule, term and any applicable
performance criteria.  The amount may be settled either in stock or in
cash, as designated by the award agreement.  Unless determined
otherwise by our board of directors, stock appreciation rights will vest in full
on the third anniversary of the date of grant or on a holder's death, permanent
disability or retirement (as defined in the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive
Plan).  Beginning with awards granted in 2006, vesting of stock
appreciation rights will not be accelerated upon the holder's retirement, but
will vest according to the regular vesting schedule.  Upon the
involuntary termination of a holder's employment with us, all vested stock
appreciation rights will be exercisable for 30 days; provided after the
termination date, however, where the termination is due to (i) retirement or
(ii) death or disability, they may be exercisable for the remaining term, or for
60 months not to exceed the remaining term, respectively.  Some
vesting requirements have been modified in accordance with local laws and the
approval of the board.  Upon voluntary termination of employment, all
stock appreciation rights (vested and unvested) forfeit on the date of
termination.  Stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with stock
options can be exercised only if the related stock option is exercisable at that
time. Unless our board of directors provides for a different period, stock
appreciation rights will have a term of ten years.
      
      Restricted
Shares/Restricted Share Units
      
      The
Company may grant restricted shares/restricted share
units.  Restricted shares are common shares granted to a participant
subject to restrictions determined by the board of
directors.  Restricted share units entitle the recipient to receive a
specified number of common shares or the cash equivalent equal to the fair
market value of such shares on the date of vesting.  A restricted
share or restricted share unit will vest and become transferable upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the restricted share/restricted
share unit award agreements.  Restricted share/restricted share unit
awards will be forfeited if a recipient's employment terminates prior to vesting
of the award.  The compensation committee will recommend to our board
of directors for approval the number of restricted share/restricted share unit
awards to grant, applicable vesting schedule, and any applicable performance
criteria.  Unless otherwise specified in the restricted
share/restricted share unit award agreements, restricted share/restricted share
unit awards will vest upon a holder's death or permanent disability or
retirement at or after age 62.  Vesting of 2008 restricted share
awards/restricted share unit awards upon a holder's retirement after age 55 with
10 years of service and prior to age 62 will have accelerated vesting of 33% for
each full year of service

      after the
date of award with the remaining shares/share units being
forfeited.  Upon retirement after age 55 with not less than 10 years
of service but prior to age 62, the employee will forfeit unvested restricted
share/restricted share units awards made during 2009 33% for each year remaining
in the vesting schedule of the award.  Unvested non-forfeited
restricted share/restricted share units awards will continue to vest according
to the award agreement as if there had been no termination of
employment.  Holders of restricted shares will have voting rights and
receive dividend equivalents prior to vesting.  Holders of restricted
share units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents prior to
vesting.
      
      Performance
Share Units
      
      Performance
share units vest upon a service requirement and achievement of specific Alcon
business objectives as selected by the Compensation Committee in its discretion
and approved by Alcon's board of directors.  The metrics for the 2009
grant consist of three one-year earnings per share ("EPS") growth targets during
a three-year service period with a cumulative three-year relative total
shareholder return ("TSR") as a modifier.  At the beginning of the
performance period, the Compensation Committee establishes a total equity award
value for each participant.  The performance share unit portion
reflects 25% of the established total value.  The actual value of the
units awarded to the employee will be adjusted based on Alcon’s three one-year
EPS targets and cumulative TSR during the three-year service
period.  The adjustment will be accomplished by multiplying the target
award by the applicable EPS award percentage and the TSR multiplier, which may
result in an award from 0 to 200%.  The compensation committee will
recommend to our board of directors for approval the number of performance share
units to grant, applicable vesting schedule, term and any applicable performance
criteria.  Unless otherwise specified in the award agreement, the
performance share unit awards will vest upon a holder's death or permanent
disability.  Vesting of performance share unit awards upon a holder's
retirement after age 62 will continue as if there was no termination of
employment.  If the employee's termination is voluntary and after
age 55 with not less than 10 years of service but prior to retirement, the
employee will forfeit unvested performance share units(have his/her target award
reduced) by 33% for each year remaining in the vesting schedule of the
award.  Unvested non-forfeited performance share units will continue
to vest according to the award agreement as if there had been no termination of
employment. Holders of performance share units have no voting rights and do not
receive dividend equivalents prior to vesting.
      
      Other
Share-Based Awards
      
      The
Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan also allows us to provide awards that are
denominated in or valued by reference to our common shares.  The grant
price for the award will not be less than the fair market value of our common
shares on the grant date.  The compensation committee will recommend
to our board of directors for approval the number and type of award to grant,
applicable vesting schedule, term and any applicable performance
criteria.

      In the
event of a change-of-control (as defined under the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive

prior to December 31, 2008, if the agreement covering the award so
provides:
      
      
        

              
                ·

                all
      outstanding cash incentive awards will vest and be paid out on a prorated
      basis; and

                all
      performance share unit awards will continue to vest under their original
      terms unless achievement of performance goals can no longer be measured,
      in which case 100% of each employee's awards vest upon completion of the
      individual service requirements.
              
            
      
      
      For
share-based awards granted on or after January 1, 2009, the board approved
modifications to the change-of-control provisions.  Vesting of future
awards will accelerate upon the occurrence of  a change-of-control
and either (i)
involuntary termination other than "for cause," or (ii) voluntary termination
for "good reason," which occur within six months preceding or during the two
years following the change-of-control.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
      
      The
Company adopted the Alcon Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP")
effective October 25, 2002.  The DCP allows certain U.S. employees the
opportunity to defer the receipt of salary, bonus and restricted
shares.  The DCP further provides that restricted shares deferred by
eligible executives can only be invested in Alcon common shares and distributed
as Alcon common shares at the end of the deferral period.
