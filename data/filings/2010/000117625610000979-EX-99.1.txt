CALGARY, ALBERTA - Alberta Star Development Corp.

Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as the term is defined in the Policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
The calculation of barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) are based on a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet (“mcf”) of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil. Boe’s may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl is base on energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
