    Executive Summary

Introduction

The Elsa Tailings Project is an
advanced project exploring the mineral potential of historical tailings from the
former United Keno Hill Mines (“UKHM”) mill located in the town of Elsa, Yukon.
The Elsa tailings are impounded on the south-eastern slopes of the McQuesten
River valley approximately 400 metres from the UKHM mill
Milling operations at Elsa started in
the 1930s and continued almost without interruption until 1988. Historical
production records indicate that approximately 4,050,000 tons of tailings were
deposited at the Elsa site. Historical resource estimates on the Elsa Tailings
Project were made by UKHM in 1970 and 1988.
On June 29, 2009 SRK Consulting
(Canada) Inc. (“SRK”) was commissioned by Alexco Resource Corporation (“Alexco”)
to prepare a mineral resource estimate for the Elsa Tailings Project. The
resource herein represents a first resource estimate for the deposit prepared
for Alexco.
This technical report documents the
resource model constructed by SRK. It was prepared following the guidelines of
the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 and Form
43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted CIM “Estimation of Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.” 
Property Description
and Agreements 
The land under the control of Alexco
comprises 717 surveyed quartz mining leases, 864 unsurveyed quartz mining
claims, and two crown grants. The total area approximates 24,300 hectares.
Certain UKHM claims may be subject to unknown or unregistered royalties and/or
agreements.
Quartz mining leases provide mineral
title to the area occupied by the tailings and are part of a large land package
controlled by Alexco through its subsidiaries, Elsa Reclamation and Development
Co. (“ERDC”) and Alexco Keno Hill Mining Corp. The tailings are located on
Quartz Leases: Orchid 1, 3, 15, 26, 31 & 37; Betty and Mud.
Alexco’s rights to much of the
  Keno Hill property are held through the ERDC, a wholly owned subsidiary. In
  June 2005, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PWC”), a court appointed interim
  receiver and receiver-manager of United Keno Hill Mines Limited and UKH Minerals
  Limited (collectively “UKHM”), selected Alexco as the preferred purchaser
  of the assets of UKHM. In February 2006, following negotiation of a Subsidiary
  Agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon, and Alexco,
  the Supreme Court of Yukon approved the purchase of the assets of UKHM by Alexco
  through its wholly owned subsidiary, ERDC. The UKHM assets comprised two Crown
  Grants, 674 mining leases, 289 mineral claims, an ore concentration plant, various
  buildings and equipment, as well as partial ownership interest in three mining
  leases, 36 mineral claims, in addition to a leasehold interest in one mineral
  claim. PWC and Alexco entered into an agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
  dated August 4, 2005, as amended on November 2, 2005 and January 31, 2006. Alexco
  assigned the Purchase Agreement to its wholly owned subsidiary ERDC on February
  6, 2006. “Interim Closing” of the UKHM transaction was completed on
  April 18, 2006. Alexco assumed responsibility for care and maintenance operations
  at the UKHM property. On November 30, 2006, Alexco terminated a contract with
  a local contractor and started
conducting operations utilizing its own employees and equipment. Title to all
UKHM assets was transferred to Alexco (“Final Closing”) in November 2007,
following the approval of a “Type B” Water License by the Yukon Water Board.

All quartz mining leases have been
legally surveyed whereas the quartz mining claims have not. In addition, in 2006
and 2007, 650399 BC Ltd., a wholly owned Alexco subsidiary, staked 673 mineral
claims (full size and fractional) adjacent to and contiguous with the UKHM
property and purchased 36 quartz claims and 37 quartz mining leases from a third
party. In 2008 and 2009, Alexco took four existing claims to lease, acquired an
additional 18 claims from a third party, and amalgamated 55 additional existing
bordering claims into the holdings. Mineral exploration at Keno Hill was
initially permitted under the terms and conditions set out by the Yukon
Government in the Class III Quartz Mining Land Use Permit – LQ00186, issued on
July 5, 2006 and valid until July 4, 2011. Alexco subsequently obtained a Class
IV Quartz Mining Land Use Permit – LQ00240 on June 17, 2008. The two permits
were amalgamated on December 8, 2008 under #LQ00240 which is valid until
December 16, 2018.
Under the terms of a legal agreement
with the Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon, Alexco is indemnified
from any and all environmental liability that may be presented by the historic
tailings. However, if Alexco were to nominate any part of the tailings as a
production unit under the above agreement, responsibility for addressing water-
related environmental liabilities would fall to Alexco.
Location Access and
Physiography 
The Elsa Tailings Project is included
within the historic Keno Hill mining camp, located in central Yukon. The closest
town is Mayo, located on the Stewart River, about 45 kilometres to the south.
Mayo is accessible from Whitehorse via a 407 kilometre all weather road; the
town is also serviced by Mayo airport, which is located just to the north. A
gravel all-weather road leads from Mayo to the project areas. Historically, the
mining camp was linked by river route to the outside world; since 1950, the
all-weather highway, which was also used for transporting the ore, has been the
main link. 
The Keno Hill area is characterized by
rolling hills and mountains with relief up to 1200 metres. Slopes are generally
gentle with steeper slopes on the north sides of Keno Hill and Sourdough Hill.
The Elsa Tailings are located on the south slope of the McQuesten valley centred
along the Flat and Porcupine Creek drainages. 
History

Milling operations at Elsa started in
the 1930s, operating almost continuously until 1988. A lead concentrate with a
periodic zinc concentrate was produced from milling operations. A cyanide leach
circuit was added in 1958 and operated periodically to 1981 depending on
prevailing economics.
It is estimated that in total
approximately 4,050,000 tons of tailings were deposited at the Elsa site. Most
of this material was allowed to run out onto the flank of the adjacent valley
without engineered impoundment. The original ground surface was covered with
small trees, brush and a vegetative mat of moss, all of which was eventually
covered by the tailings. 
The northern portion of the tailings
  was drilled by UKHM in 1970 and in a second drilling campaign from 1987 to 1988
  covering the rest of the tailings area at that time.

Metallurgical testing of the tailings
was undertaken in 1988 and 1995 by UKHM and a joint venture between UKHM and
government agencies.
Regional and Local
Geology 
The tailings lie on the south slope of
the McQuesten valley. The rounded out shape of the valley can be attributed to
at least one episode of glaciation followed by the deposition of glaciofluvial
sands and gravels related to kame terraces. The glaciofluvial sands and gravels
were deposited at higher valley elevations with till deposited at lower valley
sides and valley bottoms. During the retreat of glacial ice the McQuesten valley
bottom was covered by a shallow lake resulting in the deposition of lacustrine
silt. The lacustrine silt became increasingly organic and transitioned to peat
as the glacial lake became in filled with sediments.
The Elsa Tailings cover an irregular
area of approximately 130 hectares and range from 0.1 to over 4 metres in
thickness. While the valley flank on which the tailings have been deposited is
relatively smooth topographically, points of higher elevation occur as uncovered
“islands” within the body of the tailings. The earliest site of tailings
deposition appears to have been directly into Porcupine Creek with the material
being mostly flushed downstream into Flat Creek. Beginning in 1946, tailings
were directed away from the creeks producing small terraced accumulations
immediately below the mill. Somewhat later a pipeline was constructed that
discharged tailings further into the valley in the area between Porcupine and
Flat Creek. Ten major mines supplied feed to the Elsa Mill during its operation
in the 1930s through 1950s.From the 1960s to 1980s ore was processed by the mill
underwent a transition from high grade mineralization to lower grade
mineralization from small open pits and underground operations. 
Deposit Type and
Mineralization 
The tailings consist of generally
unconsolidated silty fine grained sand with minor medium sand grained material,
of a variable grey to light brown colour characterized by thin beds to laminae.
Detailed mineralogical examination shows that the sand grains are angular and
locally aggregated and cemented by limonite. The dominant minerals are quartz
and siderite (80 percent) with the balance composed of muscovite and other
silicate minerals along with pyrite. Occasional grains contain lead and zinc
sulphides and trace amounts of lead and zinc oxide minerals have been
identified.
Drilling

UKHM initially carried out a
percussion drilling program targeting the thicker northern portion of the
tailings in 1970. A total of 114 vertical drill holes were drilled to an average
depth of three metres. Drill hole spacing was reported at approximately 60
metres. From 1987 to 1988 a second drilling program was completed by UKHM using
a rotary drill for a total of 379 vertical holes (1,770 metres). Alexco and SRK
examined historical data and methodologies associated with these programs and
conclude that UKHM drilling data were too unreliable to be used for resource
evaluation and classification according to CIM best practice guidelines.
Alexco drilled 283 vertical sonic drill
  holes over the deposit in 2009 for a total of 910 drilled metres. The Alexco
  drilling campaign consisted of drill holes spaced at 50 metres with lines orientated
  at an azimuth of 45 degrees. Average thickness of the tailings is 2.3 metres
  ranging from a maximum thickness of 7.5 metres to a minimum of 0.2 metres.

Tailings core material is inherently
difficult to handle as it is unconsolidated and, in some cases, is saturated
with water. Because of the nature of the core material some challenges in core
recovery, logging and sample collection exist. SRK is of the opinion that the
drilling and sampling performed by Alexco was conducted with care and that the
location and handling of the core yielded reasonable samples. 
Sampling Method,
Approach and Analyses 
Drill core was sampled generally at
each run length of 1.5 metres or to the lower tailings contact. The entire core
was sampled to provide a known volume for density measurements. Sampled core
intervals were placed in polyethylene bags secured with “zip ties.”
All samples were analyzed by the ISO
9001 accredited ALS Chemex laboratory in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Upon
receipt, samples were placed under ovens for high temperature drying and weighed
when dry. Following splitting and pulverization samples were analyzed using
inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry using a four acid
digestion. Thirty three elements including silver, lead and zinc were analyzed
using this method. Gold assays were analyzed using fire assay with atomic
absorption spectrometry.
Quality control samples were placed
systematically into the sample stream. Every 20 samples contained at least one
blank sample, one standard of known value, and one request for a duplicate assay
of the previous sample.
The dry density for each of the 2009
sonic drill samples was determined for each of the assayed cores. Dry density
was calculated using the dry weight of the sample from the assay laboratory
divided by the drilled interval volume which was based on sampled interval
length and the inside diameter of the core tube.
Data Verification

SRK compared 10 percent of the drill
hole data assays to original assay certificates. No errors were found in the
drill hole assay data base. During the site visit, SRK examined three pits and
briefly logged the pit walls of three trenches. SRK also reviewed drill core
photos for the sampling program.
Mineral Resource
Estimation 
Resources were estimated based on 283
drill holes from the 2009 Alexco sonic drilling program. The data set comprises
546 sampled intervals with silver, lead, zinc and gold assays.
A wireframe model of the tailings body
was generated by Alexco using high resolution topographic surveys and
tailings/sub-surface contacts from the drilling program.
Based on tailings assays the tailings
area was subdivided into five domains: A low grade silver-lead, low grade gold,
high grade silver-lead, high grade gold, and a zinc-specific gravity domain. A
sixth separate domain was created for an isolated area away from the main
tailings impoundment.
All tailings drill holes were composited
  to 1.5 metre intervals from top to bottom with a minimum composite length of
  0.20 metres to allow for thin portions of the tailings impoundment. A review
  of composite statistics and cumulative frequency plots for the metal assays domains indicates that it
is not necessary to cap high grade values within the drill hole composites.

Specific gravity composites average
1.7 with a significant dispersion of values ranging from 0.4 to 4.6. Specific
gravity composites were capped at a high value of 4.0 and low value of 0.75 for
resource estimation. 
Variography was undertaken to
characterize the spatial continuity of the metal grade data within each resource
domain and to determine appropriate grade interpolation ranges. Variograms were
developed for four domains including gold, silver, lead, zinc and specific
gravity composites. Two structure variograms were developed for each variable in
the X and Y directions only. The relatively narrow depth of the tailings
precluded development of variograms in the Z direction. Variograms for the high
domains with insufficient composites to determine variogram models were assumed
to be the same as for low grade domains. Datamine Studio 3 was used to develop a
sub-blocked model for the deposit.
Metal grades and specific gravity were
estimated in the block model using ordinary kriging for each of the separate
domains and estimate variables. Only one estimation pass was made. 
Estimation was verified by visual
comparison of composited drill holes, cross-validation and estimation of
resources using inverse distance squared and nearest neighbour routines at no
cut-off. 
While drilling and sampling
procedures, tightly spaced drilling, and assay results provide a high level of
confidence, the inherent challenges related to drilling and sampling
unconsolidated material are reflected in significant outliers in specific
gravity determinations. These outliers could not be fully explained by expected
specific gravity ranges or measurable sampling errors. For this reason SRK is of
the opinion that it is appropriate to classify the Elsa Tailings resource blocks
as Indicated. This is because the estimates are based on detailed and reliable
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques that
are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably
assumed.
Mineral Resources
Statement 
Mineral Resources for the Elsa
Tailings Project have been estimated at 2.49 million tonnes at 119 grams of
silver per tonne (“gpt silver”) , 0.12 gpt gold, 0.99 percent lead, and 0.70
percent zinc at a 50 gpt silver cut-off grade. The Mineral Resource Statement

Mineral Resources for the Elsa
Tailings Project have been classified according to the “CIM Standards on Mineral
Resources and Reserves: Definition and Guidelines” (December, 2005) by Mr. G.
David Keller, P. Geo (#1235) an “Independent Qualified Person” as defined by
National Instrument 43-101. 
Interpretation and
Conclusions 
Six domains were generated by SRK to
separate high grade zones for silver, lead and gold. An additional domain was
generated for a geographically distinct tailings area that is physically
separate from the main tailings. Metal grades were estimated separately for each
domain using ordinary kriging. Capping was not applied to metal assays or
composites. Dry specific gravity composites were capped using a lowest and
highest capping value.
After validation and classification,
SRK used silver and gold grades to determine “reasonable prospects for economic
extraction.” The basis of this determination was metal grades, heap leach
recoveries and estimated mining and processing costs from comparable
projects.
The mineral resource statement
prepared by SRK is reported at silver cut-off grades of 50 gpt, which are based
on the likely extraction scenario. All material in the resource estimate is
above this grade. 
Recommendations

It is SRK’s opinion that resources for
the Elsa Tailings Project have been defined to sufficient accuracy to support
the preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”). Alexco has
embarked on extensive metallurgical test work to document the metallurgical
properties of the tailings material and evaluate appropriate processing options.
This aspect is critical for the PEA study. Untested areas containing additional
tailings are known to occur peripherally to the current resource area. These
zones offer potential to increase the current resource and are recommended for
exploration sampling. Estimated costs for the recommended programs are
summarized in Table ii.

    Introduction
      
  
     
      
      
  
     
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings Project is an advanced project
      delineating the mineral potential of historical tailings from the former
      United Keno Hill Mines (“UKHM”) mill located in the town of Elsa, Yukon.
      The Elsa tailings are impounded on the south-eastern slopes of the
      McQuesten River valley approximately 400 metres from the UKHM mill. .
    
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      Milling operations at Elsa started in the 1930s and
      continued almost continuously until 1988. Historical production records
      indicate that approximately 4,050,000 tons of tailings were deposited at
      the Elsa site. Most of this material was allowed to run out onto the flank
      of the adjacent valley without engineered impoundment. The original ground
      surface was covered with small trees, bush and a vegetative mat of moss,
      all of which was eventually covered by the tailings. In 1958 a dam was
      constructed to prevent tailing-laden water from moving to the west along
      the Flat Creek drainage. At the same time the tailings discharge point was
      moved from Porcupine Creek to a point further east, forcing the tailings
      to accumulate behind the dam. Over time, two additional dams were
      constructed below the first dam to control run off across older tailings.
      
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      Historical resource estimates on the Elsa Tailings
      Project were made by UKHM in 1970 and 1988. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      On June 29, 2009 SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (“SRK”) was
      commissioned by Alexco Resource Corporation (“Alexco”) to prepare a
      mineral resource estimate for the Elsa Tailings Project. The mineral
      resource statement reported herein represents a first evaluation of
      mineral resources prepared for the Elsa Tailings Project for Alexco.
    
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      This technical report documents the mineral resource
      estimate for the Elsa Tailings Project. It was prepared following the
      guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument
      43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted CIM
      “Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice
      Guidelines.”

      The SRK Group comprises over 800 professionals, offering
      expertise in a wide range of resource engineering disciplines. The SRK
      Group’s independence is ensured by the fact that it holds no equity in any
      project and that its ownership rests solely with its staff. This permits
      SRK to provide its clients with conflict-free and objective
      recommendations on crucial judgment issues. SRK has a demonstrated track
      record in undertaking independent assessments of Mineral Resources and
      Mineral Reserves, project evaluations and audits, technical reports and
      independent feasibility evaluations to bankable standards on behalf of

      Site Visit
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In compliance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines,
      Mr. G. David Keller visited the Alexco site at Elsa from August 5 to
      August 9, 2009 in conjunction with visits to two concurrent Alexco
      projects. Mr. Keller dedicated time to the Elsa Project from August 7 to
      August 9, 2010. The purpose of the visit was
to:


  
     
    • 
    Examine tailings impoundment area
      and tailings material; 
  
     
    • 
    Examine open trenches and cuts in
      tailings impoundment area; 
  
     
    • 
    Review and discuss previous
      drilling and sampling data; and 
  
    
    
      • 
    
      Formulate a drilling and sampling strategy with Alexco to
      evaluate mineral resources for the project. 
SRK completed the site visit before
  the Alexco sonic drilling program started and did not witness the execution
  of the drilling and sampling program. SRK was involved in the planning stage
  for the drilling program and discussed the program extensively with Alexco staff.
  SRK examined core photos and data from the drilling program.

      Reliance on other Experts and
      Declaration 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      SRK’s opinion contained herein and effective June 16,
      2010, is based on information provided to SRK by Alexco throughout the
      course of SRK’s investigations, which in turn reflect various technical
      and economic conditions at the time of writing. Given the nature of the
      mining business, these conditions can change significantly over relatively
      short periods of time. Consequently actual results may be significantly
      more or less favourable. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      This report includes technical information, which
      requires subsequent calculations to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted
      averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and
      consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, SRK does not
      consider them to be material. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      SRK is not an insider, associate or an affiliate of
      Alexco and neither SRK nor any affiliate has acted as advisor to Alexco or
      its affiliates in connection with this project. The results of the
      technical review by SRK are not dependent on any prior agreements
      concerning the conclusions to be reached, nor are there any undisclosed
      understandings concerning any future business dealings. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings Project is located within the historic
      Keno Hill mining camp. Minimal new surface disturbances have occurred
      within the project area arising from surface drilling. Potential
      environmental liabilities associated with the Elsa Tailings Project were
      excluded from the work program. As such, no verification was conducted by
      SRK and no opinion is expressed regarding the environmental aspect of this
      project. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings Project is part of a larger property
      which comprises two Crown grants, 717 mining leases, six surface leases,
      three fee simple lots and 864 unsurveyed mineral claims (copies presented
      in Appendix A) covering an aggregate area of approximately 150 square
      kilometres (“km2”). Alexco informed SRK that the titles are in
      good standing and that as of October, 2009, they are wholly owned by
      Alexco free of liens. For the purpose of this assignment SRK has not
      verified the status of the mining titles with the Government authorities.
      
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      SRK was informed by Alexco that there are no known
      litigations potentially affecting the Elsa Tailings Project.

      Property Description and Location
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings Project is located within Alexco’s Keno
      property situated in the Mayo Mining District approximately 450 kilometres
      north of Whitehorse, Yukon. The area is covered by NTS map sheets 105M/13
      and 105M/14. Access to the property is via a paved, two-lane highway from
      Whitehorse to Mayo (407 kilometres) and an all-weather gravel road
      northeast from Mayo to Elsa (45 kilometres) – a total distance of 452
      kilometres.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The tailings are impounded on the south-eastern slope of
      the broad McQuesten River valley centred along the Flat and Porcupine
      Creek drainages and are located approximately 400 metres northwest of the
      abandoned town of Elsa.


  
     
    3.1 
    
      Land Tenement
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The land under the control of Alexco comprises 717
      surveyed quartz mining leases, 864 unsurveyed quartz mining claims, and
      two crown grants. The total area approximates 24,300 hectares outlined in
      Figure 1. Certain UKHM claims may be subject to unknown or unregistered
      royalties and/or agreements.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Quartz mining leases provide mineral title to the area
      occupied by the tailings and are part of a large land package controlled
      by Alexco through its subsidiaries, Elsa Reclamation and Development Co.
      (“ERDC”) and Alexco Keno Hill Mining Corp. The tailings are located on
      Quartz Leases: Orchid 1, 3, 15, 26, 31 & 37; Betty and Mud.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    3.2 
    
      Underlying Agreements
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco’s rights to much of the Keno Hill property are
      held through ERDC, a wholly owned subsidiary. In June 2005,
      PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PWC”), a court appointed interim receiver and
      receiver-manager of United Keno Hill Mines Limited and UKH Minerals
      Limited (collectively “UKHM”), selected Alexco as the preferred purchaser
      of the assets of UKHM. In February 2006, following negotiation of a
      Subsidiary Agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of
      Yukon, and Alexco, the Supreme Court of Yukon approved the purchase of the
      assets of UKHM by Alexco through its wholly owned subsidiary, ERDC. The
      UKHM assets comprised two Crown Grants, 674 mining leases, 289 mineral
      claims, an ore concentration plant, various buildings and equipment, as
      well as partial ownership interest in three mining leases, 36 mineral
      claims, in addition to a leasehold interest in one mineral claim. PWC and
      Alexco entered into an agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated August
      4, 2005, as amended November 2, 2005 and January 31, 2006. Alexco assigned
      the Purchase Agreement to its wholly owned subsidiary ERDC on February 6,
      2006. In February 2006, following the negotiation of a Subsidiary
      Agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon, and
      Alexco, the Supreme Court of Yukon approved the purchase of the assets of
      UKHM by ERDC. “Interim Closing” of the UKHM transaction was completed on
      April 18, 2006. Alexco assumed
responsibility for care and maintenance operations at the UKHM property. On the
Interim Closing, among other things, Alexco:

    • 
    
      Deposited CD$10 M in trust to be used exclusively to fund
      ERDC’s contribution to the cost of the reclamation of the pre-existing
      environmental liabilities of the UKHM property; 
  
    
    • 
    
      Obtained possession of the mineral claims and leases,
      titled property and crown grants of UKHM and the equipment on the UKHM
      properties for the purposes of contracted care and maintenance and
      exploration by ERDC of the UKHM property. 
On November 30, 2006, Alexco
terminated a contract with a local contractor and started conducting operations
utilizing its own employees and equipment. Title to all UKHM assets was
transferred to Alexco (“Final Closing”) in late November 2007, following the
approval of a “Type B” Water License by the Yukon Water Board. A water licence
is the main operating licence in the Yukon and is required in order to use water
and to deposit waste in or near water. On January 24, 2008, Alexco applied for a
“Type B” Water Licence covering its proposed underground exploration program at
Bellekeno. Commercial production and processing cannot commence until a Type “A”
Water Licence is obtained. Finally, previous environmental assessments of the
property outlined the need for a comprehensive abandonment/reclamation plan,
which was required by the historic operating water licence. UKHM submitted an
abandonment plan in 1990; however, government regulatory agencies judged it
deficient in several respects. Alexco is formulating an Existing State of Mine
Closure Plan for the entire district as part of its agreements with the
Governments. The quartz mining claims and leases currently owned by Alexco cover
an aggregated area of approximately 24,300 ha, forming an east-northeast
trending belt about 29 kilometres long and up to eight kilometres wide within
the Keno Hill Mining District (Figure 4.2) . The titles of the following land
assets were transferred to Alexco after the issuance of a Type “B” Water Licence
on 14 November 2007: 



  
     
    • 
    
      100 percent of 637 quartz mining leases, 2 Crown grants,
      and 85 quartz mining claims; 
  
     
    • 
    
      50 percent of 3 quartz mining leases; 
  
     
    • 
    
      70 percent of 29 quartz mining claims; 
  
     
    • 
    
      65 percent of 7 quartz mining claims.

All quartz mining leases have been legally
  surveyed whereas the quartz mining claims have not. In addition, in 2006 and
  2007, 650399 BC Ltd., a wholly owned Alexco subsidiary staked 673 mineral claims
  (full size and fractional) adjacent to and contiguous with the UKHM property
  and purchased 36 quartz claims and 37 quartz mining leases from a third party.
  In 2008 and 2009, Alexco took four existing claims to lease, acquired an additional
  18 claims from a third party, and amalgamated 55 additional existing bordering
  claims into the holdings. Mineral exploration at Keno Hill was initially permitted
  under the terms and conditions set out by the Yukon Government in the Class
  III Quartz Mining Land Use Permit – LQ00186, issued on July 5, 2006 and
  valid until July 4, 2011. Alexco subsequently obtained a Class IV Quartz Mining
  Land Use Permit – LQ00240 on June 17, 2008. The two permits were amalgamated on December 8, 2008 under #LQ00240 which is
      valid until December 16, 2018.

      Under the terms of a legal agreement with the Government
      of Canada and the Government of Yukon, Alexco is indemnified from any and
      all environmental liability that may be presented by the historic
      tailings. However, if Alexco were to nominate any part of the tailings as
      a production unit under the above agreement, responsibility for addressing
      water- related environmental liabilities would fall to Alexco.

      Royalties
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Future production from the Keno Hill Silver District,
      including the Bellekeno Mine, is subject to a 1.5 percent NSR royalty,
      capped at CD$4.0 M, payable to the Government of Canada. This royalty is a
      condition of the Subsidiary Agreement. Payment of the royalty does not
      begin until all pre-production capital has been recouped plus an
      additional allowance for district exploration of approximately CD$6.2
      M.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco and Silver Wheaton Corporation (“Silver Wheaton”)
      entered into an agreement on October 2, 2008 (the “Silver Purchase
      Agreement”) whereby 25 percent of all future silver production from the
      Keno Hill Silver District will be delivered to Silver Wheaton in exchange
      for a payment of US$3.90/oz as well as a payment by Silver Wheaton of
      US$50 M for use in the development and construction of the Bellekeno
      Mine.

      Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources,
      Infrastructure and Physiography


  
     
    4.1 
    
      Accessibility
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings Project is included within the historic
      Keno Hill mining camp, located in central Yukon. The closest town is Mayo,
      located on the Stewart River, about 45 kilometres to the south. Mayo is
      accessible from Whitehorse via a 407 kilometres all weather road; the town
      is also serviced by Mayo airport, which is located just to the north. A
      gravel all-weather road leads from Mayo to the project areas.
      Historically, the mining camp was linked by river route to the outside
      world; since 1950, the all-weather highway, which was also used for
      transporting the ore, has been the main link.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Gravelled tracks have been built on top of the tailings
      impoundment for monitoring and reclamation work.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    4.2 
    
      Local Resources
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Three phase power is available in many parts of the
      district as well as limited telephone service. A large number of roads
      constructed for past mining operations are still serviceable. The old
      company town of Elsa, located toward the western end of the district,
      comprises several buildings that are currently being used for storage,
      maintenance work, and housing. A new camp and kitchen have been
      constructed at Flat Creek, just west of Elsa.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    4.3 
    
      Climate
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The central Yukon is characterized by a sub-arctic
      continental climate with cold winters and warm summers. Average
      temperatures in the winter are between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees
      Celsius but can reach minus 60 degrees Celsius. The summers are moderately
      warm and in July average temperatures are around 15 degrees Celsius.
      Exploration and mining work can be carried out year-round.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Because of its northern latitude, winter days are short;
      north-facing slopes experience 10 weeks without direct sunlight around the
      winter solstice. Conversely, summer days are very long, especially in
      early summer around the summer solstice. Annual precipitation averages 28
      centimetres; half of this amount falls as snow, which starts to accumulate
      in October and remains on the ground into May or
June.

      Physiography
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Keno Hill area is characterized by rolling hills and
      mountains with relief up to 1200 metres. Slopes are generally gentle with
      steeper slopes on the north sides of Keno Hill and Sourdough Hill. The
      Elsa tailings are located on the southslope of the McQuesten valley,
      centred along the Flat and Porcupine Creek drainages as outlined in Figure
      2.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Valleys and slopes of the Keno Hill area are moderately
      to densely vegetated with grasses, shrubs and predominantly conifer
      forests. The tailings impoundment area is sparsely vegetated with
      occasional grass and shrubs with moderate to densely vegetated areas
      fringing the tailings area. Typical terrain of the tailings impoundment is
      presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

      History


  
     
    5.1 
    
      District History
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The history of the Keno Hill mining camp is well
      described in Cathro (2006); the information presented in this section
      draws heavily from that source. The Keno Hill mining camp area has a rich
      history of exploration and mining dating back to the beginning of the
      1900s. Earliest prospectors had been working the area around Mayo for
      gold, especially after the Klondike gold rush of 1898. The first silver
      was found in 1901; however, interest was low due to the prospector’s
      interest in gold alone despite an assay from 1905 yielding more than 10
      kilograms per ton (“kg/t”) silver. Small-scale mining commenced in 1913
      with a first shipment of 55 tons of ore to a smelter in San Francisco. Due
      to the First World War, interest in the area had dwindled by
  1917.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In the early 1920s, the Treadwell Yukon Company Limited
      (“TYC”) became interested in the Keno Hill area and, under the leadership
      of Livingston Wernecke, acquired a number of claims and started mining. By
      1941, in just under 18 years, when Wernecke died in an accident, TYC had
      produced 1,381 tons of silver and 43,772 tons of lead. More than half of
      that amount came from the Keno Hill mine. By this time a number of mines
      were in production, including: Sadie-Ladue, Lucky Queen, Silver King,
      Elsa, and Hector-Calumet; combined, about 85 percent of the camp’s
      production came from these mines. Interestingly, no zinc was
    recovered.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Wernecke’s death in 1941 and the onset of the Second
      World War resulted in the closure of TYC’s properties. After the war a new
      company, Keno Hill Mining Company Ltd., (later United Keno Hill Mines
      Ltd.), purchased the idle TYC assets and resumed production. Almost
      immediately a major new vein was discovered by underground diamond
      drilling in the Hector Calumet mine, propelling United Keno Hill Mines
      (“UKHM”) to the forefront of Canadian silver production.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The 1950s proved to be the most profitable period in the
      history of the camp, but by the early 1960s, minable reserves lagged
      production and considerable money was being spent in exploring for new
      deposits. A significant discovery was made at what would become the Husky
      mine in the late 1960s. In 1977 the first in a series of open pits was
      initiated primarily targeting low grade mineralization and pillars left
      near the surface of historic underground workings.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Low silver prices, labor shortages and rising
      environmental costs forced UKHM to cease production in early 1989. Total
      production for the camp to 1989 is estimated to be 5.34 million short tons
      grading 40.1 ounces per ton Silver, 6.7 percent Lead and 4.1percent zinc
      (Cathro, 2006). Leasing of specific properties contributed a small amount
      of continued production through 1990.

      Between 1990 and 1998 The Dominion Mineral Resources and
      Sterling Frontier Properties Company of Canada Limited (“Dominion”), after
      acquiring a 32 percent interest in UKHM, carried out extensive
      reclamation, remediation and exploration work preparatory to reopening the
      camp. However, financing problems eventually forced Dominion to abandon
      its rights which reverted to UKHM. Environmental liabilities and site
      maintenance costs eventually drove UKHM into bankruptcy, resulting in the
      Federal Government of Canada inheriting the assets.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In 2006 Alexco was selected as the prime contractor for
      environmental remediation work on the former UKHM property. Alexco was
      also allowed to purchase the property assets. Between 2006 and present
      Alexco carried out surface exploration throughout the district eventually
      concentrating on development of the historic Bellekeno mine area through
      extensive underground excavation and drilling.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    5.2 
    
      Elsa Tailings History
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The files of UKHM contain several documents related to
      the Elsa Tailings impoundment, most detailing earlier efforts to estimate
      contained metals in the tailings. A summary of this information
      follows:
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Two mills have been sited at Elsa over the years; 1.) A
      flotation mill operated by the TYC during the late 1930s and early 1940s,
      which was refurbished in 1945, 2.) A new mill constructed after 1945 when
      the previous mill was destroyed by fire in 1949. The existing mill
      operated almost continuously from 1949 until 1988. Both mills produced a
      lead flotation concentrate and sometimes a zinc concentrate. A cyanide
      circuit to leach mill tails also operated during the years 1958 to 1966,
      1968 and 1979 to 1981 as dictated by the prevailing economics of the
      time.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      It is estimated that in total approximately 4,050,000
      tons of tailings were deposited at the Elsa site. Most of this material
      was allowed to run out onto the flank of the adjacent valley without
      engineered impoundment. The original ground surface was covered with small
      trees, brush and a vegetative mat of moss, all of which was eventually
      covered by the tailings. In 1958 a dam was constructed (Dam #1) to prevent
      tailings-laden water from moving to the west along the Flat Creek
      drainage. At the same time the tailings discharge point was moved from
      Porcupine Creek to a point further east, forcing the tailings to
      accumulate behind Dam #1. Over time, two additional dams were constructed
      below Dam #1 to control run off across older tailings (Figure
2).
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In 1970 a portion of the active tailings pond was sampled
      using an in-house percussion drill. The drilling covered the northerly
      part of the tailings where the depths of material were relatively modest
      ten feet (three metres) for the most part. Borehole spacing was
      approximately 200 feet (sixty metres). No detailed description of the
      drilling or sampling has been found in existing records. Assay
      certificates showing the results were also not found. Over the next
      eighteen years additional tailings were deposited in this
  area.

In 1987 and 1988 the upper, thicker
and generally higher grade portion of the tailings was sampled using a rotary
drilling rig. Approximately 379 holes were drilled for a total of 5,396 feet
(1,770 metres). Samples were collected over five -foot intervals and analyzed
for silver, lead, zinc, and iron. Some samples were also analyzed for cadmium
and non-sulphide lead.
Using the 1970 and 1987 to 1988
drilling results historical resources for the tailings were estimated at 4.05
million tons grading approximately 3.14 ounces per ton silver (108 gpt silver)
of material. The reader is cautioned that this historical mineral resource
estimate was prepared before the development of National Instrument 43-101
guidelines and the reported figures should not be relied upon. 
Metallurgical test work on tailings
were undertaken by UKHM in 1988 and again in 1995 in a project jointly funded by
two government entities and UKHM. The 1995 test work was summarized in a report
by Hawthorne (1996). UKHM excavated pits at a number of points to collect
additional samples for gravity separation, flotation and leach tests for the
1995 test work.
Alexco excavated several test pits in
  the tailings area as part of an ongoing study of possible reclamation closure
  options (SRK, 2009).

      Geological Setting
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings are the net result of 85 years of
      mining activity in the Keno Hill district. As such a regional geology
      section is included in the report as background for the origin of tailings
      material.


  
     
    6.1 
    
      Background Regional Geology
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Keno Hill mining camp is located in the north western
      part of the Selwyn Basin in central Yukon Territory, Canada. The area is
      characterized by the Robert Service Thrust Sheet and the Tombstone Thrust
      Sheet; these thrust sheets are overlapping and trend north-westerly. The
      area is underlain by Upper Proterozoic to Mississippian rocks that were
      deposited in a shelf environment during the formation of the northern
      Cordilleran continental margin (Figure 5). A compressional regime that
      possibly existed during the Jurassic, but certainly during the Cretaceous,
      produced thrusts, folds and penetrative fabrics of various scales. Early
      large scale deformation (D1) produced recumbent folds, resulting in local
      structural thickening of strata. A second deformational event (D2; and
      possibly third, D3, Roots, 1997) produced gentle south westerly plunging
      syn- and anti-form pairs. Layering in these structures are axial planar to
      the D1 recumbent folds.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Robert Service Thrust Sheet is composed of Late
      Proterozoic to Cambrian sandstone, locally with interbedded limestone and
      argillite, a Cambrian to Middle Devonian succession of siltstone,
      limestone and chert, and Upper Devonian argillite, chert, and chert pebble
      conglomerate. The latter unit unconformably overlies the lower
    units.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Tombstone Thrust Sheet consists of Devonian phyllite,
      felsic meta-tuffs and metaclastic rocks, overlain by Carboniferous
      quartzite. This latter rock unit is locally thickened due to folding and
      or thrusting and hosts the mineralization of the Keno Hill camp.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Intrusive rocks formed during four episodes of plutonism.
      Early Palaeozoic fine-grained diabase occurs as metre-scale dikes and
      sills in the Upper Proterozoic to Lower Cambrian rocks. During the
      Mid-Triassic, gabbros to diorites formed pods of various sizes, primarily
      in the Devonian and Mississippian rocks of the Tombstone Thrust Sheet. A
      third phase of plutonism took place around 92 million years ago in the
      early Cretaceous and resulted in widespread and voluminous Tombstone
      intrusions of commonly granitic to granodioritic composition. The youngest
      magmatic activity occurred around 65 million years ago in the Upper
      Cretaceous and resulted in the formation of peraluminous megacrystic
      potassium feldspar granite.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In addition to the Keno Hill silver mining camp, where
      polymetallic veins were exploited, the area hosts a number of occurrences
      and showings of tungsten, copper, gold, lead, zinc, antimony and
      barite.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Tin, tungsten, and molybdenum occurrences are possibly
      related to the suite of Cretaceous intrusions, whereas lead, zinc, and
      barite occur in stratiform calcareous sedimentary rocks of early
to mid-Palaeozoic age typical of sediment-hosted deposits.

    6.2 
    
      Background Property Geology
      
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      The local geology is characterized by three
      meta-sedimentary rock units: Lower Schist, Central Quartzite, and Upper
      Schist (Figure 6). Individual layers are thought to be conformal and are
      metamorphosed to greenschist facies assemblages. Regional metamorphism is
      believed to have occurred in the Middle Cretaceous, about 105 million
      years ago. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      The Lower Schist is of Devonian to Mississippian age and
      is composed of graphitic, calcareous, and sericitic schist, thin and
      locally thick-bedded quartzite and minor greenstone of Middle Triassic
      age. The greenstone forms sills and/or boudins consisting of metadiorite
      and metagabbro. The sills and boudins form bodies up to one kilometre long
      and 30 metres thick. They occur primarily on Keno Hill. Weathering of the
      Lower Schist is pronounced and results in small silica fragments supported
      by a clay matrix. The fast weathering prevents outcrops from forming. The
      lower contact of this unit has been truncated by the Tombstone Thrust
      Fault. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      The Mississippian Central Quartzite, also known as the
      Keno Hill Quartzite, has a structural thickness of approximately 700
      metres and consists of bedded and massive quartzite with minor schist and
      phyllite layers as well as greenstone horizons, which occur most commonly
      in the lower half of the Central Quartzite. The thickness of this unit is
      especially great in the Keno Hill area, which is likely due to the
      presence of a D1 fold nose and accompanied structural thickening in the
      Keno Hill area. Underground exposure has revealed tight isoclinal folding.
      Internal fracturing leaves the unit prone to weathering, resulting in the
      formation of felsenmeer down slope, where large slabs of quartzite
      accumulate. This unit is the most important host to the mineralization of
      the Keno Hill camp. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      A package of Cambrian quartz-mica schist, quartzite,
      graphitic schist, and minor limestone comprise the Upper Schist. The
      Robert Service Thrust Fault separates the Upper Schist from the younger
      Central Quartzite.

      The Elsa tailings lie on the south slope of the McQuesten
      valley. The rounded out shape of the valley can be attributed to at least
      one episode of glaciation that was followed by the deposition of
      glaciofluvial sands and gravels related to kame terraces. The
      glaciofluvial sands and gravels were deposited at higher valley elevations
      with till deposited at lower valley sides and valley bottoms. During the
      retreat of glacial ice, the McQuesten valley bottom was covered by a
      shallow lake resulting in the deposition of lacustrine silt. The
      lacustrine silt became increasingly organic and transitioned to peat as
      the glacial lake became in filled with sediments. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      Feed to the Elsa mill came solely from polymetallic vein
      deposits scattered throughout the Keno Hill district. Approximately 4.6
      million tons of ore having an average head grade of 37.3 ounces. per ton
      silver, 6.4 percent lead and 4.4 percent zinc are documented to have been
      processed by the facility. Mill feed sources changed over time and the
      mineralogical character of the ore varied as a result. Production of near
      surface oxidized mineralization often contained ore minerals which were
      not readily amenable to flotation. A cyanide leach plant was employed to
      recover some of the silver not reporting to concentrates, but the
      economics associated with a fluctuating silver price forced the plant to
      run only intermittently. Zinc minerals occur erratically in the veins of
      Keno Hill and a zinc flotation concentrate was not always produced. From
      1972 to 1988 zinc head grades averaged less than one percent and much of
      the metal was allowed to flow out in the tailings. Beginning in 1979 open
      pits became an important source of mill feed lowering the overall head
      grade and supplying a mixed oxide and sulphide ore.

      Deposit Types
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings cover an irregular area of
      approximately 130 hectares and range from 0.1 to over four metres in
      thickness. While the valley flank on which the tailings have been
      deposited is relatively smooth topographically, points of higher elevation
      occur as uncovered “islands” within the body of the tailing. The earliest
      site of tailings deposition appears to have been directly into Porcupine
      Creek with the material being mostly flushed downstream into Flat Creek.
      Beginning in 1946, tailings were directed away from the creeks proper
      producing small terraced accumulations immediately below the mill.
      Somewhat later a pipeline was constructed that discharged tailings further
      into the valley in the area between Porcupine and Flat Creek. An earthen
      dam (#1 Dam) was constructed in 1958 across upper Flat Creek and the
      tailings discharge line moved again, this time to the east forcing
      material to be deposited behind the dam.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Ten major mines supplied feed to the Elsa Mill during its
      operation. Production from the 1930s, 40s, and 1950s was dominated by
      high-grade deposits such as Elsa mine and Hector-Calumet mine on Galena
      Hill. The 1960s saw a transition in ore sources with the reopening of the
      Silver King mine and discovery of the high-grade Husky deposit. The 1970s
      and 80s witnessed the demise of old producers and the introduction of
      lower grade material from open pits and smaller underground operations
      such as Ruby, No Cash and Keno 700.

      Tailings Composition
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The tailings consist of generally unconsolidated silty
      fine grained sand with minor medium sand and trace clay grained material,
      of a variable grey to light brown colour characterized by thin beds to
      laminae (Figure 7). Exposures in test pits show that near surface the
      material is darker in colour suggesting it is more oxidized than the
      deeply buried tailings. Detailed mineralogical examination shows that the
      sand grains are angular and locally aggregated and cemented by limonite.
      The dominant are quartz and siderite (80 percent) with the balance
      composed of muscovite and other silicate minerals along with pyrite.
      Occasional grains contain lead and zinc sulphides and trace amounts of
      lead and zinc oxide minerals have been identified via x-ray
      diffraction.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The tailings material is moderately to weakly
      consolidated in some areas occasionally forming indurated crusts near the
      top of the tailings surface. Some pits examined by SRK show indurated
      crust at depth probably developed during previous surface exposure. Small
      scale cross beds are observed locally in tailings pits. The
      sub-surface/tailings contact is typified by dark grey clays and silt as
      well as black organic matter as shown in pit trench near drill hole H19 in
      Figure 8.

      Introduction
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Elsa Tailings were drilled by UKHM and Alexco to
      delineate the geometry of the tailings, collect samples for assay and
      support evaluation of mineral resources. A summary of the drilling
      completed on the tailings is provided in Table 1.

    10.2.1 
    
      UKHM Drilling
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In 1970 UKHM carried out a percussion drilling program
      targeting the thicker northern portion of the tailings. A total of 114
      vertical drill holes were drilled to an average depth of three metres.
      Drill hole spacing was reported at approximately 60 metres. Very little
      historical data is available for this drilling program.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      From 1987 to 1988 a second drilling program was completed
      by UKHM using a rotary drill for a total of 379 vertical holes (1,770
      metres). This program covered the southern portion of the tailings
      impoundment that was not covered by drilling completed in 1970. Holes were
      spaced approximately 100 feet (30 metres) apart. Depths of tailings were
      determined by scrutinizing the drill cuttings for organic material and
      changes in sample grades. Drill cuttings for the entire drilled interval
      were sent for analysis. Limited assay certificates for this program are
      available.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco and SRK examined historical UKHM data and
      methodologies and concluded that drilling data is too unreliable to be
      used for resource evaluation and classification and does not conform to
      CIM best practice guidelines. The main concerns are centred on non-coring
      drilling methods used by UKHM. It is SRK’s opinion that the drilling
      methodologies used by UKHM probably resulted
in:


  
     
    • 
    Sample contamination from the borehole wall ;
      and 
  
     
    • 
    Poor accuracy in determining the subsurface
      tailings contact.

    10.2.2 
    
      Alexco Drilling
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco drilled 283 vertical sonic drill holes over the
      deposit in 2009 for 910 drilled metres. The Alexco drilling campaign
      consisted of drill holes spaced at 50 metres with lines orientated at an
      azimuth of 045 degrees (Figure 10). Average thickness of the drilled
      tailings is 2.3 metres ranging from a maximum thickness of 7.5 metres to a
      minimum of 0.2 metres. As none of the drill holes exceeded 7.5 metres in
      depth. No down hole surveys were deemed necessary.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco contracted Boart-Longyear of Edmonton, Alberta to
      complete the drilling program using a sonic drill mounted on a tracked
      carrier. A sonic drill uses simultaneous high-frequency vibrational and
      low-speed rotational motion accompanied by down-pressure to advance a
      flush thread drill pipe. As the drill string is advanced, material is
      pushed up into the pipe. The drill bit used by Boart-Longyear was 3.854
      inches (9.79 centimetres) in diameter. No water or other fluids were used
      in the drilling process.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco drilling procedures consisted of drilling 5 foot
      (approximately 1.5 metre) runs. For each five foot run the drill string
      was removed from the hole in order to remove core. Once it had been
      established that the tailings had been completely drilled and the
      tailings/subsurface interface had been reached, drilling was halted. The
      base of the tailings was identified in most cases by a layer of organic
      material or visible changes in the oxidation and composition of the drill
      core.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Core for each run was removed by vibrating the drill pipe
      so that core was slowly vibrated out of the pipe and in to a polyethylene
      sleeve that the drill helper pulled back as the sleeve was filled. When
      sample recovery proved difficult, the hole was abandoned and a new hole
      was started in close proximity to the original hole.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In some instances portions of the sample would fall out
      of the open ended bit as the pipe was pulled up after each run,
      particularly if the material was water saturated. The lost portion of the
      sample was retrieved in the following drill run or a new hole was drilled
      with an extra long run to “sandwich” saturated sections between firmer
      stretches of tailings or drill material.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Polyethylene sleeves containing tailings cores were
      opened in trays for logging and sampling at each drill site. The cores
      were initially examined to establish that the lower tailings contact had
      been drilled. All drill core was then logged and photographed. A typical
      core sample from drill hole P-13 is shown in Figure 9.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Tailings core material is inherently difficult to handle
      as it is unconsolidated and, in some cases, is saturated with water.
      Because of the nature of the core material, challenges in core recovery,
      logging and sample collection can result from:


  
     
    • 
    Water saturated material becoming
      very fluid;

      SRK completed the site visit before the sonic drilling
      program started and did not witness the execution of the drilling and
      sampling program. SRK was involved in the planning stage for the drilling
      program and discussed the program extensively with Alexco staff. SRK
      examined core photos and data from the drilling program. SRK is of the
      opinion that the drilling and sampling performed by Alexco was conducted
      with care and that the location and handling of the core yielded
      reasonable samples.

      Collar Survey
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Drill hole collar locations were established prior to
      drilling using a GPS in real-time communication with a base station
      operated by a professional surveyor. The base station occupied an
      established survey point which is part of the district wide survey control
      grid. The point is located immediately north of the tailings area. Survey
      accuracy is estimated to be within 20 centimetres. Proposed collars were
      marked with pickets and the drill holes drilled within 20 centimetres of
      the location.

      Sampling Approach and Methodology
    
  
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In most cases 1.5 metre (five foot) drill runs were
      employed during drilling, but very short runs and runs up to 3.05 metres
      in length were combined in some instances to produce a continuous series
      of core samples. After logging, the entire core from each run interval was
      placed in a polyethylene sample bag securely closed with plastic zip ties.
      A sample tag with a number from a continuous series was placed in the bag
      and the outside of the bag was marked with the same number. Sample
      intervals were variable but the contact between tailings and the previous
      surface always acted as a sample boundary.

      Sample Preparation, Analyses
      andSecurity
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      All polyethylene sample bags were packed in enclosed
      wooden crates with screws holding the lids in place. The crates were
      loaded into a covered semi- trailer and shipped to a motor freight company
      depot in Whitehorse, Yukon where they were transferred to commercial
      freight trucks destined for the ISO 9001 accredited ALS Chemex laboratory
      in North Vancouver, British Columbia.


  
     
    12.1.1 
    
      Sample Preparation and Analyses
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Upon arrival at the ALS Chemex laboratory, each entire
      sample was weighed and dried in a high temperature oven at 120 degrees
      Celsius. Dry weight of the entire sample was then determined. The dried
      sample was then homogenized and split into three subset samples of one
      kilogram using a rotary splitter. One of the sample sub sets was then
      pulverized until 85 percent of the material was less than 75 micrometres.
      The initial analytical method applied was inductively coupled
      plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (Chemex code ME-ICP61 and ME-OG62)
      using a four acid digestion on a one gram sample charge. Thirty-three
      elements including silver, lead and zinc were analyzed using this method.
      Gold assays were analyzed using fire assay with atomic absorption
      spectrometry on a 30 gram sample charge (Chemex code Au- AA25). The ALS
      Chemex Vancouver laboratory is also accredited ISO 17025 by the Standards
      Council of Canada (Accreditation No. 579) for certain test procedures
      including the one used to assay the Elsa Tailings samples.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    12.1.2 
    
      Analytical Quality Control Measures
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Quality control samples were placed systematically into
      the sample stream. Every 20 samples contained at least one blank sample,
      one standard of known value, and one request for a duplicate assay of the
      previous sample. The blank material consisted of ordinary masonry
    sand.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The standard material used by Alexco is PB 131 produced
      by WCM Minerals of Burnaby, British Columbia. The reference material has
      been used successfully by Alexco previously as quality control sample for
      drilling programs at the Bellekeno deposit. Although the material has not
      been certified, WCM Minerals recommended values
are:
Lead    
 1.04 % Zinc       1.89 %

  Silver     262 gpt 
Although no gold values for PB 131 are
recommended Alexco used this material as a gold reference material.
Results of the Alexco quality control
  assay results are provided in Appendix A.

    12.1.3 
    
      Sampling Bias
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In the opinion of SRK, the quality control data collected
      by Alexco is comprehensive and the assaying results delivered by ALS
      Chemex are reliable for the purpose of resource estimation.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    12.1.4 
    
      Specific Gravity Data
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      UKHM applied a blanket density of 1.6 to the tailings in
      their historic resource evaluation. There is no documentation detailing
      how they arrived at this value.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Bulk density field measurements were determined in 2007
      by SRK as part of a test pitting program. A standard metal cylinder
      designed for testing was inserted into near surface tailings and removed
      without compressing the material so that the entire cylinder was filled
      with tailings. The cylinder and tailings were then measured using a hand
      held spring scale. The wet density of the material was then calculated by
      subtracting the weight of the cylinder from the weight of the cylinder
      plus tailings to determine the weight of the tailings material. This
      weight was then divided by the volume of the cylinder to determine wet
      tailings density. Dry density was measured by visually estimating moisture
      content. The average measured density for tailings material was 1.9 grams
      per cubic centimetre.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco also conducted density measurements using 10
      Shelby tubes, which were pushed into the tailings and removed by a drill
      rig. This method was problematic because poor core recovery affected
      nearly all samples. These results were not used for specific gravity
      investigations.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The dry specific gravity for each of the 2009 sonic drill
      samples was measured for each of the assayed cores. Dry density was
      determined using the dry weight of the sample from the assay laboratory
      divided by the sampled interval volume. Sampled interval volume was
      calculated by interval length multiplied by the inside area of the core
      barrel which has an inside diameter of 0.0762 metres. Specific gravity
      results from this methodology ranged from 0.4 to 4.6 with a mean of
      1.7.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The range of specific gravity results is problematic;
      however, extensive analysis and review of results by SRK and Alexco did
      not identify specific sources of possible errors that invalidate the
      entirety of the results. Therefore, possible errors in measurements were
      attributed to the inherent difficulties of sampling unconsolidated
      material. It is SRK’s opinion that these specific gravity values are
      appropriate for use in estimating block specific
gravity.

    Data
      Verification 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      SRK compared 10 percent of the drill hole data assays to
      original assay certificates. No significant errors were found in the drill
      hole assay database. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      During the site visit, SRK examined three pits and
      briefly logged the pit walls. A summary of the logs are provided in
      Appendix B. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
    
    
    
      The 2009 sonic drill hole program was completed after the
      SRK site visit. As such drill core was not examined or reviewed by SRK. As
      the entire drill core was sent for analysis, no core remained for
      subsequent examination. SRK did review Alexco drill core photos taken
      immediately before sampling.

    15.1 
    
      Introduction 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      The following is based on a note from Kappes, Cassiday
      & Associates of Reno, Nevada dated June 3, 2010 that summarizes test
      work completed to date. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    15.2 
    
      Summary of Metallurgical Test Work
  
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      A series of metallurgical tests have been run on
      individual and composite samples of the Keno Hill Tailings material. The
      existing test work is preliminary in nature and is focused on identifying
      the best method for silver recovery. The results presented herein detail
      the recovery of silver and show that silver can be recovered using
      standard hydrometallurgical techniques. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      In late 2009, the laboratory facility of Kappes, Cassiday
      & Associates (“KCA”) in Reno, Nevada, received reject and pulp sample
      splits from ALS Chemex . The samples received were either pulp samples
      previously prepared by ALS Chemex or reject (drill cuttings) material. The
      samples received represented drill sampling of the Keno Hill Tailings
      located in the Yukon. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    15.3 
    
      Sample Composition 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      Alexco provided an aerial photograph of the tailings
      showing the drill hole identification numbers divided into four separate
      locations. The drill hole numbers were cross referenced to KCA sample
      numbers and four composite samples were created from the reject material.
      
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    15.4 
    
      Cyanide Shake Tests 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      A portion of the 548 previously prepared pulp samples
      from ALS Chemex were used for cyanide shake tests. These shake test were
      conducted over a period of 24 hours at room temperature using a shaking
      table. The samples were then centrifuged and the solution was decanted and
      analyzed for silver utilizing flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer
      (FAAS) methods. Each sample was tested individually. For this report the
      results of the shake tests were averaged to generate an estimated overall
      recovery for the tailings material. The results are shown in Table 2.
    
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    15.5 
    
      Bottle Roll Tests 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      A series of 40 bottle roll leach tests were conducted to
      determine the maximum amount of cyanide leachable silver. Tests were
      conducted at various cyanide concentrations and grind sizes typical of an
      agitated leach process. The average results are shown in Table 2.

      Column Leach Tests
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Column leach tests were conducted to determine the
      maximum amount of recoverable silver in a heap leach. Because the tailings
      have been ground to a p80 of 200 microns KCA conducted a number of
      agglomeration and percolation tests. These tests help to quantify the
      amount of cement necessary to build a stable production heap that will
      maintain permeability. The results of these tests showed that the tailings
      material needs a significant amount of cement to meet desired
      requirements.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The column leach program is currently underway. At the
      time this report was issued only one set of column leach test data was
      available. The material in this set of column leach tests was agglomerated
      with 25 kg/tonne of cement. Percolation was poor and another set of tests
      is planned at higher cement levels. The material with 25 kg/tonne cement
      continues to leach showing that silver recovery is possible even under
      less than ideal conditions.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The existing column leach results are incomplete as the
      tailings have only been under leach for 36 days. The incomplete silver
      recovery is shown in Table 2.

  the fact that these tests are preliminary there exists the potential to increase
  silver recovery with further metallurgical test work.

      Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve
      Estimates


  
     
    16.1 
    Introduction
      
  
     
      
      
  
     
    
    
      In July 2009, SRK was commissioned by Alexco to prepare a
      mineral resource estimate for the Elsa Tailings Project. The resource
      estimate follows two historical resource estimates completed by UKHM.
    
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      The resource estimation work was completed in Toronto by
      Mr. G. David Keller, P. Geo (APGO #1235) an “independent qualified person”
      as this term is defined in National Instrument 43-101. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      The mineral resource statement presented herein
      represents the first resource evaluation prepared for the Elsa Tailings
      Project for Alexco. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      This section describes the resource estimation
      methodology used by SRK and summarizes the key assumptions and parameters
      used to prepare the mineral resource model for the Elsa Tailings Project.
      
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported
      herein is a reasonable representation of the mineral resources found in
      the project at the current level of sampling. The mineral resources have
      been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM “Estimation of
      Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices” guidelines and are
      reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators’ National
      Instrument 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not
      have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or
      any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.
      
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    16.2 
    
      Resource Data 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
    
    
      Data used to evaluate the mineral resources for the Elsa
      Tailings Project was provided by Alexco as an Access database containing
      drilling information for 283 drill holes from the 2009 sonic drilling
      program. No historical data was used for this project. The data set
      comprises 546 sampled intervals with silver, lead, zinc and gold assays
      for each interval. 
  
     
      
    
       
  
     
      
    
      SRK has validated the data by:



  
     
    • 
    
      Checking the minimum and maximum values for each quality
      value field and confirming those outside of expected ranges; 
  
     
    • 
    
      Checking for gaps, overlaps and out of sequence intervals
      for both assay and lithology tables; and 
  
     
    • 
    
      Reviewing of analytical quality control data.
  
It is SRK’s opinion that the drill
  hole database is appropriate for the estimation of mineral resources.

    16.3 
    
      Solid Body Modelling
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The tailings were modelled by Alexco. Alexco combined the
      upper and lower surfaces to generate a three dimensional wireframe model.
      High resolution topographic survey over the tailings and mapping tailings
      extents from drilling and air photo interpretation were used to generate
      an upper surface. The lower surface was generated from
      tailings/sub-surface contacts determined from sonic drilling
  data.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      SRK reviewed the Alexco wireframe model and considers it
      accurate and appropriate for the estimation of mineral
resources.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    16.4 
    
      Domaining
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      SRK investigated the spatial distribution of assays and
      composites over the tailings area generating grade contours maps for gold,
      silver, zinc and lead. Based on these contour plots the main tailings area
      was subdivided into five domains. Contiguous high and low grade domains
      were generated for gold and silver-lead assays. As these domains represent
      distinct grade distributions the domains overlap and are not contiguous
      with each other metal domains. A separate domain comprising of the entire
      main tailings area was generated for variables that did not show distinct
      distributions of the tailings area. A sixth separate domain was created
      for an isolated area in the Porcupine Creek, in a gully above the main
      tailings area. This domain is discrete from all metal grades and specific
      gravity values defining other tailings domains. Domains generated by SRK
      are listed below:


  
     
    • 
    AGHG-high grade
      silver-lead; 
  
     
    • 
    AGLG-low grade
      silver-lead; 
  
     
    • 
    AUHG-high grade gold;
  
  
     
    • 
    AULG-low grade gold;

  
     
    • 
    ZINC-not domained,
      includes dry specific gravity; and 
  
     
    • 
    Proximal-isolated tailings
      in gully above main tailings area. 
The High Grade, Low Grade, and Proximal
  domains are shown in Figure 11. The AGHG domain is delineated on the basis of
  silver grade contours and is situated on the southwest margin of the main tailings.
  The AGLG domain occupies all areas not covered by the AGHG domain. Both AGLG
  and AGHG domains were used to estimate silver and lead grades only. The AUHG
  domain is delineated by gold contours and occupies the southern to southeastern
  margin of the main tailings. The AULG domain covers all areas not covered by
  AUHG. Zinc grades do not show any distinct grade zoning and therefore cover
  the entire main tailings area excluding the Proximal domain. Similarly, specific
  gravity data do not show any distinct zoning and therefore cover the entire
  tailings area (ZINC) excluding the proximal domain.

      A summary of raw undomained and uncomposited raw assay
      data for the tailings is provided in Table 3. Drill hole data was
      composited to a length of 1.5 metres based on 87.7 percent of sampled
      intervals being at 1.5 metres as shown Figure 12. A check of the sample
      lengths for each of the eight domains yielded similar results.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Composite statistics for each of the eight domains are
      summarized in Appendix C. A review of composite statistics, cumulative
      frequency histogram plots, and an examination of the spatial distribution
      of higher grades in the tailings model indicate that capping is not
      required. Cumulative frequency plots for the low grade silver domain are

      Specific Gravity
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Specific gravity measurements of dry sonic drilling
      material resulted in a wide range of results from 0.4 to 4.6. The wide
      range of values particularly above 4.0 and below 1.0 is of some concern
      and SRK undertook a number of analysis and
examinations:


  
     
    • 
    
      Back calculation of lead and zinc grades to galena and
      zinc densities core specific gravity; 
  
     
    • 
    
      Scattergram plots of specific gravity values with assay
      grades and sample length; 
  
     
    • 
    
      Generation of specific gravity variograms with uncapped
      data and using caps on low and high values; and 
  
     
    • 
    
      Visual examination of spatial occurrence of high and low
      values in model. 


  
     
    
    
      The above checks did not provide conclusive evidence that
      the specific gravity data was biased or that the data was seriously
      flawed. Based on this, SRK concludes that variations observed in the
      specific gravity data are due to the inherent challenges of sampling
      unconsolidated material but that the data is of sufficient quality for use
      in resource estimation. Summary statistics for specific gravity composites
      are provided by domain Appendix C.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Drill hole specific gravity data were composited at 1.5
      metres and capped using a low capping value of 0.75 (any values blow 0.75
      where assigned a value of 0.75) and a high capping value of 4.0. No
      specific gravity values were capped in the Proximal domain but 11 values
      were capped (2 high caps and 9 low caps) in the ZINC domain.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    16.6 
    
      Variography
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Variography was undertaken to characterize the spatial
      continuity of the metal grade data and specific gravity within each
      resource domain and to determine appropriate grade estimation ranges.
      Variogram models were developed for the AULG, AGLG, and ZINC domains only
      for the X and Y directions as there were insufficient composites for
      developing variograms in the Z direction. Variograms for gold were
      generated in the AULG domain, silver and lead in the AGLG domain, zinc dry
      specific gravity (DSG) in the ZINC domain. In developing the variograms, a
      nugget effect of about 20 percent was assumed for all variograms. Two
      structured variograms were developed for the three domains. The variogram
      for silver is presented in Figure 14. Other variograms are presented in
      Appendix D.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Variograms were not generated for the high grade domains
      and the proximal domain as there were too few composites for analysis.
      AULG and AGLG variogram models were assumed for high grade gold (AUHG) and
      silver-lead domains (AGHG) as well as the Proximal domain. The DSG
      variogram was also assumed for Proximal domain specific gravity
      estimation. A summary of variogram model parameters is given in Appendix
      D.

      Block Model Parameters
  
  
     
      
    
      
  
     
    
    
      A sub-blocked model for the Elsa Tailings was generated
      using Datamine Studio 3. The block model coordinates are based on the
      local UTM coordinated grid (NAD 83, Zone 8). The parent block size is 10
      by 10 by 10 metres which are sub-blocked to 1.25 metres in the X and Y
      directions and 0.01 metres in the Z direction. 
  
     
      
    
      
  
     
    
    
      The block model Z direction of 10 metres was designed to
      be larger than maximum thickness of the tailings so that one block covers
      the entire thickness of tailings in each block. SRK considers vertical
      variations of grade in the deposit too small scale to model accurately
      with the sampling data available. This is not considered an important
      factor from a mining perspective. Similarly, the block model was chosen to
      be horizontal rather than inclined as the deposit slopes at an average of
      less than two degrees. The definition of the Elsa block model is presented
      in Table 4.

      Grade Estimation
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Metal grades and specific gravity were estimated using
      ordinary kriging. Metal grades were estimated separately in each domain
      from capped composite data from that domain.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Metal grades and specific gravity were estimated in a
      single run using ordinary kriging and considered hard boundaries for all
      domains. Only composites within each domain were used to estimate domain
      blocks. Silver and lead grades were estimated only for AGHG, AGLG domains.
      The ZINC domains were used to estimate zinc and specific gravity values
      and the HGAU and LGAU domains were used to estimate gold only. All metal
      grades and specific gravity values were estimated in the Proximal domain.
      As vertical grade variations across the tailings thickness are not
      considered, a large radius of 40 metres was used for the search ellipse Z
      range. Estimation parameters for all estimates
are:


  
     
    • 
    Search ellipse range, 500 by 500 by 40 metres
      (X, Y and Z directions); 
  
     
    • 
    Minimum composites per estimate: eight; and
  
  
     
    • 
    Maximum composites per estimate: 150.
  
Estimates were made using full blocks
  only, with full block values assigned to each sub-block contained in the full
  sized block. A cross-section of the estimated block model with estimated grades
  is provided in Figure 15and Figure 16. A three dimensional view of the estimated
  silver grade block model is provided in Figure 17.

      Estimation Validation
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Estimates were verified by comparing estimated block
      values to composite and uncomposited drill hole data. Additional
      verification was undertaken using cross validation and comparing ordinary
      kriging estimates against two other estimators for the low grade silver
      domain at no cut-off (inverse distance power of two and nearest
      neighbour). All validation checks confirm that the block estimates are
      appropriate and reflect the underlying borehole sampling data.

      Mineral Resource Classification
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Mineral Resources for the Elsa Tailings Project have been
      classified according to the “CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and
      Reserves: Definition and Guidelines” (December, 2005) by Mr. G. David
      Keller, P. Geo (APGO#1235) an “Independent Qualified Person” as defined by
      National Instrument 43-101.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      While drilling and sampling procedures, tightly spaced
      drilling, and assay results provide a high level of confidence, the
      inherent challenges related to drilling and sampling unconsolidated
      material are reflected in significant outliers in specific gravity
      determinations that could not be fully explained by expected specific
      gravity ranges or measurable sampling errors. For this reason, SRK is of
      the opinion that it is appropriate to classify the Elsa Tailings resource
      blocks as Indicated because the estimates are based on detailed and
      reliable exploration and testing information gathered through
      appropriate techniques that are spaced closely
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. The level
of confidence in the estimates is sufficient to allow the appropriate
application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and
evaluation of the economic viability of this deposit.

      Mineral Resources Statement
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and
      Mineral Reserves (December 2005) defines a Mineral Resource
  as:
“[A] concentration or occurrence of
diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized minerals
in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location,
quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource
are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and
knowledge.” 
The “reasonable prospects for economic
extraction” requirement generally implies that quantity and grade estimates meet
certain economic thresholds and that mineral resources are reported at an
appropriate cut-off grade taking into account extraction scenarios and
processing recoveries. For the tailings deposit, a potentially economic cut-off
grade was determined to be 50 grams per tonne (“gpt”) silver based on the
following assumptions:


  
     
    • 
    Silver price US$17 per troy
      ounce; 
  
     
    • 
    Gold price US$1,000 per troy
      ounce; 
  
     
    
      • 
    
      Heap leach recovery of 85 and 35 percent for silver and
      gold, respectively; and 
  
     
    • 
    Mining, processing and G&A
      costs of US$18.92 per tonne. 
As all estimated block silver grades
in the model are above 50 gpt, it is SRK's opinion that all material within the
Elsa Tailings block model can be adequately reported as a Mineral Resource
amenable for surface mining within the meaning of CIM Definition Standards. 
Mineral Resources were estimated in
conformity with generally accepted CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resource and
Mineral Reserve Best Practices” guidelines. The Mineral Resources may be
affected by further infill and exploration drilling that may result in increases
or decreases in subsequent resource estimates. The mineral resources may also be
affected by subsequent assessments of mining, environmental, processing,
permitting, taxation, socioeconomic and other factors.
The Mineral Resources for the Elsa Tailings
  Project are estimated at 2.49 million tonnes at 119 gpt silver, 0.12 gpt gold,
  0.99 percent lead, and 0.70 percent zinc at a 50 gpt silver cut-off grade. All
  tailings material has been found to be potentially economic. The mineral resource
  statement for the Elsa Tailings deposit is presented in Table 5. A tonnage and
  grade chart for the model is provided in Figure 18.

      Interpretation and Conclusions
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Exploration work by Alexco is professionally managed and
      procedures used conform to industry best practice. During the SRK review,
      challenges in sampling unconsolidated material were recognized
      particularly with respect to the measurement of dry specific gravity
      values. However, it is SRK’s opinion that these challenges do not
      materially impact on the quality of the resource estimates reported
      herein. SRK is of the opinion that the exploration data are sufficiently
      reliable to interpret with confidence the estimated boundaries of the
      block model and support evaluation and classification of mineral resources
      in accordance with generally accepted CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resource
      and Mineral Reserve Best Practices” and CIM “Definition Standards for
      Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves” guidelines.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Six non-contiguous and in some cases overlapping domains
      were generated by SRK to separate high grade zones for silver, lead and
      gold. An additional domain was generated for a physically distinct
      tailings area that is separate from the main tailings. Metal grades were
      estimated separately for each domain using ordinary kriging. Capping was
      not applied to metal assays or composites. Dry specific gravity composites
      were capped, using a lowest and highest capping value.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      After validation and classification, SRK used silver and
      gold grades to determine “reasonable prospects for economic extraction.”
      The basis of this determination were metal grades, heap leach recoveries
      and estimated mining and processing costs from comparable
  projects.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The mineral resource statement prepared by SRK is
      reported at a silver cut-off grade of 50 gpt which is based on the likely
      extraction scenario. All material in the resource estimate is above this
      grade.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Alexco has identified other areas adjacent to unestimated
      or currently modelled areas as outlined in Figure
19.

      Recommendations
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      It is SRK’s opinion that resources for the Elsa Tailings
      Project have been defined to sufficient accuracy to support the
      preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”). Alexco has
      embarked on extensive metallurgical test work to document the
      metallurgical properties of the tailings material and evaluate appropriate
      processing options. This aspect is critical for the PEA study.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In addition, untested areas containing additional
      tailings are known to occur peripherally to the current resource area.
      These zones offer potential to increase the current resource and are
      recommended for exploration sampling. Estimated costs for the recommended
      programs are summarized in Table 6.
