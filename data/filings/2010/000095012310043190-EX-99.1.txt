AirMedia Announces Unaudited First Quarter 2010 Financial Results



Beijing, China — May 3, 2010 — AirMedia Group Inc. (“AirMedia” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: AMCN),
a leading operator of out-of-home advertising platforms in China targeting mid-to-high-end
consumers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31,
2010.


First Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights






     
    •
     
    Total revenues increased by 48.7% year-over-year and by 7.9% quarter-over-quarter to
US$48.8 million, a record high in AirMedia’s operating history.



     
 
     
    •
     
    Gross profit was US$2.2 million, improving from gross loss of US$2.8 million in the
previous quarter.



     
 
     
    •
     
    Loss from operations was US$8.5 million, improving from loss from operations of US$24.5
million in the previous quarter.



     
 
     
    •
     
    Net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders was US$6.5 million, improving from net
loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$19.4 million in the previous
quarter1. Basic and diluted loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per
American Depositary Share (“ADS”) were both US$0.10.



     
 
     
    •
     
    Adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP), which is net loss
attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and
amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$3.8 million, improving from adjusted
net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$17.1 million in the previous
quarter. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per
ADS (non-GAAP) were both US$0.06.





“Despite the usual seasonality in the first quarter of 2010, we were still able to achieve
record total revenues of US$48.8 million with our core business continuing to grow
quarter-over-quarter, which brought about a good start to the Company’s recovery in 2010. Although
we are facing some temporary challenges on our gas station advertising network, our existing
business in the air sector continues to see strong revenue growth in the second quarter and the
rest of the year, which enables us to give strong annual guidance for 2010. Advertisers’ strong
demand and visibility for the full year also give us strong confidence that the Company will break
even no later than the third quarter of this year,” commented Herman Guo, chairman and chief
executive officer of AirMedia.


“We are pleased to see the sequential improvement in gross profit which demonstrates the
improvements of our business. Strong demand from advertisers has enabled us to further increase
advertising listing prices and lower discounts for digital frames in airports and digital TV
screens on airplanes sequentially in the first quarter of 2010. We have seen continued strong
growth of revenues from digital frames in airports and digital TV screens on airplanes. The
revenues from traditional media in the Beijing and Shenzhen airports, which had been our biggest
drag in 2009, continued to ramp up in the first quarter of 2010. Reduced concession fees as a
result of our termination of the operation of certain unprofitable media will also help us back to
profitability,” Xiaoya Zhang, AirMedia’s president and interim chief financial officer, added,
“Based on our current assessment of collection of accounts receivable in connection with certain
doubtful accounts, we have decided to make adjustments to our unaudited fourth quarter 2009
financial results to reflect higher bad debt provision, which resulted from the economic downturn in 2009.
Since the first quarter of 2010, we have adopted a stricter credit policy and procedures for new
customers in order to mitigate risks associated with bad debts in the future.”

Total revenues for the first quarter of 2010 reached US$48.8 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 48.7% from US$32.8 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 7.9% from US$45.2
million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from digital frames
in airports, traditional media in airports, other media, digital TV screens on airplanes, and gas
station media network. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to increases in revenues
from digital frames in airports, other media, digital TV screens on airplanes, and gas station
media network.


Revenues from digital frames in airports



Revenues from digital frames in airports for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 85.9%
year-over-year and by 8.3% quarter-over-quarter to US$22.4 million. The year-over-year increase was
due to an increase in the number of time slots sold, which was partially offset by a decrease in
the average advertising revenue per time slot sold (the “ASP”). The quarter-over-quarter increase
was due to an increase in the ASP. Please refer to “Summary of Selected Operating Data” below for
detailed definitions of the operating data cited in this press release.


The number of time slots sold for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 169.4% year-over-year and
decreased by 6.1% quarter-over-quarter to 9,134 time slots. The year-over-year increase was due to
continued sales efforts and growing acceptance of AirMedia’s digital frames. The
quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to the increase in the ASP, which resulted in fewer time
slots sold while advertisers spent the same amount of advertising budgets or increased their
budgets at a rate less than the percentage of the ASP increase. AirMedia’s digital frames were in
operation in 32 airports in the first quarter of 2010, up from 25 airports at the end of the first
quarter of 2009, and 31 airports at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009. The number of time slots
available for sale for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 25.8% year-over-year and decreased by
0.5% quarter-over-quarter to 30,144 time slots. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an
increase in the number of airports in AirMedia’s digital frame network. The quarter-over-quarter
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating days in the first quarter of 2010 with only
28 days in February 2010. The utilization rate of digital frames for the first quarter of 2010
increased by 16.2 percentage points year-over-year and decreased by 1.8 percentage points
quarter-over-quarter to 30.3%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the
increase in the number of time slots sold. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to
the decrease in the number of time slots sold.

The ASP of digital frames for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 31.6% year-over-year and
increased by 15.3% quarter-over-quarter to US$2,452. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due
to higher discounts offered in the first quarter of 2010 than in the same period one year ago. The
quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the increases in the listing prices of digital
frames in the Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou airports in the first quarter of 2010 and the fourth
quarter of 2009, as well as the lower discounts offered across the board.


Revenues from digital TV screens in airports



Revenues from digital TV screens in airports for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 47.1%
year-over-year and by 13.7% quarter-over-quarter to US$6.5 million, primarily due to a decrease in
the ASP.


The number of time slots sold for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 9.9 % year-over-year and
increased by 84.8% quarter-over-quarter to 7,505 time slots. The year-over-year decrease was
primarily due to advertisers’ shift in their budget allocations from our digital TV screens in
airports to our other products in airports and on airplanes. The quarter-over-quarter increase was
primarily due to higher discounts offered to promote digital TV screens in airports. The number of
time slots available for sale for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 10.4% year-over-year and
by 10.1% quarter-over-quarter to 23,050 time slots primarily due to the termination of operation of
digital TV screens in four second-tier and third-tier airports. The utilization rate for the first
quarter of 2010 increased by 0.1 percentage points year-over-year and by 16.7 percentage point
quarter-over-quarter to 32.6%, primarily due to the increase in the number of time slots sold.


The ASP of digital TV screens in airports for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 41.3 %
year-over-year and by 53.3% quarter-over-quarter to US$862. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter decreases were primarily due to higher discounts offered and the change in the
mix of the time slots sold. The number of time slots sold in the airports other than the top three
airports, which have significantly lower ASPs than those sold in the top three airports, accounted
for a much higher percentage of total number of time slots sold in the first quarter of 2010 than
in the same period one year ago and in the previous quarter.


Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes



Revenues from digital TV screens on airplanes for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 142.6%
year-over-year and by 9.3% quarter-over-quarter to US$6.9 million. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter increases were due to increases in both the number of time slots sold and the
ASP of digital TV screens on airplanes.


The number of time slots sold for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 74.4% year-over-year and
by 4.4% quarter-over-quarter to 286 time slots due to continued sales efforts. The number of time
slots available for sale for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 24.4% year-over-year and by
9.3% quarter-over-quarter to 408 time slots primarily due to the termination of operation on the
airplanes of China United Airlines and less advertising time on Air China’s airplanes. The
utilization rate for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 39.7 percentage points year-over-year
and by 9.2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 70.1%. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter increases were due to the increase in the number of time slots sold and the
decrease in the number of time slots available for sale.


The ASP of digital TV screens on airplanes for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 39.4%
year-over-year and by 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to US$23,972. The year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter increases in the ASP were primarily due to lower discounts offered and the
increase in the listing prices of digital TV screens on Air China’s airplanes.

Revenues from traditional media in airports



Please note that part of the prior comparative figure of “Other Displays” has been reclassified to
“Traditional Media in Airports” to conform to the current presentation.


Revenues from traditional media in airports for the first quarter of 2010 primarily included
revenues from traditional media in Beijing Capital International Airport, Shenzhen International
Airport and Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport, as well as revenues from billboards and painted
advertisements on gate bridges in certain airports. Revenues from traditional media in airports for
the first quarter of 2010 increased by 147.8% year-over-year and decreased by 3.1%
quarter-over-quarter to US$9.9 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the
commencement of operations of traditional media in the Beijing and Shenzhen airports in April 2009.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to fewer revenues from billboards and painted
advertisements on gate bridges in airports, which were offset by continuously improved sales of
traditional media in the Beijing and Shenzhen airports. The decrease in the revenues from
billboards and painted advertisements on gate bridges in airports was primarily because there was a
one-month vacant period in January 2010 for advertisements on gate bridges in one airport after the
original advertising contract expired. A new contract was signed in February 2010.


The number of locations sold for the first quarter of 2010 increased 63.1% year-over-year and 9.8%
quarter-over-quarter to 393 locations primarily due to continued sales efforts. The number of
locations available for sale for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 21.3% quarter-over-quarter
to 680 locations primarily because AirMedia terminated the operation of certain unprofitable
traditional media in Beijing Capital International Airport as well as billboards and painted
advertisements on gate bridges in certain airports. The utilization rate of traditional media for
the first quarter of 2010 increased by 16.4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 57.8%
primarily due to the decrease in the number of locations available for sale and the increase in the
number of locations sold.


The ASP of traditional media in airports for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by 11.7%
quarter-over-quarter to US$25,186 primarily due to more locations with lower listing prices being
sold in the first quarter of 2010.


Revenues from the gas station media network



Revenues from the gas station media network for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 72.5%
quarter-over-quarter to US$176,000.


As of April 30, 2010, AirMedia had installed its media, including scrolling light boxes and
billboards, in a total of 939 Sinopec gas stations, of which 215 are located in Beijing, 280 in
Shanghai, 99 in Shenzhen and the remaining 345 in 12 other cities.


Revenues from other media 



Revenues from other media were US$2.5 million, which were primarily from Beijing AirMedia City
Outdoor Advertising Co., Ltd., a company AirMedia acquired in January 2010, which operates unipole
signs and other outdoor media across Beijing.


Please refer to “Summary of Selected Operating Data” for more operating data.


Business tax and other sales tax



Business tax and other sales tax for the first quarter of 2010 were US$1.0 million, compared to
US$1.1 million in the same period one year ago and US$943,000 in the previous quarter. For
purposes of calculating the amount of business and other sales tax, concession fees are permitted
to be deducted from total revenues under applicable PRC tax law.

Net revenues



Net revenues for the first quarter of 2010 reached US$47.8 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 50.6% from US$31.7 million and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 7.9% from US$44.3
million.


Cost of Revenues



Cost of revenues for the first quarter of 2010 was US$45.5 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 75.9% from US$25.9 million and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 3.3% from US$47.1
million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in concession fees in
connection with the expansion of AirMedia’s business. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was
primarily due to reduced concession fees. Cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in the
first quarter of 2010 was 95.3%, compared to 81.7% in the same period one year ago and 106.4% in
the previous quarter.


AirMedia incurs concession fees to airports for placing and operating digital TV screens, digital
frames, traditional media and other displays in airports, to airlines for playing programs on their
digital TV screens, to Sinopec for placing outdoor media in its gas stations, and to other media
resources owners for placing unipole signs and other outdoor media across Beijing.


Concession fees for the first quarter of 2010 were US$31.9 million, representing a year-over-year
increase of 68.3% from US$19.0 million and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 9.1% from US$35.1
million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to newly signed or renewed concession rights
contracts during the period. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to reduced
concession fees by terminating the operation of certain unprofitable media in several airports in
the first quarter of 2010 and in the fourth quarter of 2009, which had a full-quarter impact in the
first quarter of 2010, and the lack of one-time penalties that had been recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2009. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was partially offset by the increase in the
concession fees associated with outdoor advertising platform in some additional Sinopec service
stations, concession fees incurred by the newly acquired Beijing AirMedia City Outdoor Advertising
Co., Ltd., and incremental concession fees associated with the concession rights contract of
Terminal 2 of Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Concession fees as a percentage of net
revenues in the first quarter of 2010 was 66.9%, compared to 59.9% in the same period one year ago
and 79.3% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase of concession fees as a percentage
of net revenues was primarily due to the fact that incremental concession fees associated with new
concession rights contracts were fixed once concession rights contracts were entered into, while
revenues generated from newly signed concession rights contracts would take time to ramp up.


Gross Profit/Loss 



Gross profit for the first quarter of 2010 was US$2.2 million, compared to gross profit of US$5.8
million in the same period one year ago and gross loss of US$2.8 million in the previous quarter.


Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the first quarter of 2010 was 4.7%, compared to
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues of 18.3% in the same period one year ago and gross
loss as a percentage of net revenues of negative 6.4% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year
decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the increase in
concession fees. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the decrease in cost of revenues.

    Please refer to “Adjustment to Unaudited Fourth Quarter 2009 Financial Results”.





Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were US$10.8 million, representing a
year-over-year increase of 33.1% from US$8.1 million and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 50.5%
from US$21.7 million.


Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2010 included share-based compensation expenses
of US$1.8 million, compared to share-based compensation expenses of US$1.2 million in the same
period one year ago and share-based compensation expenses of US$1.8 million in the previous
quarter. Adjusted operating expenses (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010, which excluded
share-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, were US$8.1
million, representing a year-over-year increase of 29.0% from US$6.3 million and a
quarter-over-quarter decrease of 58.3% from US$19.4 million. Adjusted operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenues (non-GAAP) in the first quarter of 2010 was 16.9%, compared to 19.7% in
the same period one year ago and 43.8% in the previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP
Adjusted Operating Expenses” for a reconciliation of operating expenses under U.S. GAAP to adjusted
operating expenses (non-GAAP).


Selling and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were US$4.1 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$514,000. This represented a year-over-year increase of
38.8% from US$3.0 million and remained relatively unchanged from the previous quarter. The
year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to expansion of the direct
sales force and increased share-based compensation expenses.


General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were US$6.6 million, including
share-based compensation expenses of US$1.3 million. This represented a year-over-year increase of
29.7% from US$5.1 million and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 62.4% from US$17.6 million. The
year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher bad-debt provisions, higher amortization of
acquired intangible assets, headcount increase and increased expenses for office lease and
utilities. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to lower bad-debt provisions, lower
staff expenses and lower professional service fees.


Loss from Operations



Loss from operations for the first quarter of 2010 was US$8.5 million, as compared to loss from
operations of US$2.3 million in the same period one year ago and loss from operations of US$24.5
million in the previous quarter.


Adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010, which excluded share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$5.8 million, compared
to adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) of US$436,000 in the same period one year ago and
adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) of US$22.2 million in the previous quarter. Adjusted
operating margin (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010, which excluded the effect of share-based
compensation expenses and amortization of acquired
intangible assets, was negative 12.2%, compared to negative 1.4 % in the same period one year ago
and negative 50.1% in the previous quarter.

to Non-GAAP Adjusted Income (Loss) from Operations” for a reconciliation of income/loss from
operations under U.S. GAAP to adjusted income/loss from operations (non-GAAP).


Income Tax Benefit/Expense



Income tax expenses for the first quarter of 2010 was US$21,000, compared to income tax benefit of
US$123,000 in the same period one year ago and income tax benefit of US$4.4 million in the previous
quarter.


Net Loss Attributable to AirMedia’s Shareholders



Net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders for the first quarter of 2010 was US$6.5 million,
compared to net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$1.3 million in the same period
one year ago and net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$19.4 million in the
previous quarter. The basic and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS
for the first quarter of 2010 were both US$0.10, compared to basic and diluted net loss
attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.02 in the same period one year ago and
basic and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS of US$0.30 in the
previous quarter.


Adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010,
which is net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation
expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was US$3.8 million, compared to adjusted
net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) of US$577,000 in the same period one
year ago and adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP) of US$17.1
million in the previous quarter. Basic and diluted adjusted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010 were both US$0.06, compared to basic
and diluted adjusted net income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) of
US$0.01 in the same period one year ago and basic and diluted adjusted net loss attributable to
AirMedia’s shareholders per ADS (non-GAAP) of US$0.26 in the previous quarter.


Please refer to the attached table for a reconciliation of net loss/income attributable to
AirMedia’s shareholders and basic and diluted net loss/income attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders per ADS under U.S. GAAP to adjusted net loss/income attributable to AirMedia’s
shareholders and basic and diluted adjusted net loss/income attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders
per ADS (non-GAAP).


Cash, Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments



Excluding restricted cash of US$1.4 million, cash and short-term investments totaled US$76.2
million as of March 31, 2010, compared to US$124.3 million as of December 31, 2009. The decrease in
cash and short-term investments from December 31, 2009, was primarily due to an increase in prepaid
concession fees incurred, based on the terms of certain material concession rights contracts.


Adjustments to Unaudited Fourth Quarter 2009 Financial Results



In response to significant budget cuts by multinational corporation clients in 2009, the Company
provided services to some new, smaller domestic advertising agencies and domestic clients in 2009,
which resulted in certain doubtful accounts. The Company had been making efforts to
collect accounts receivable from these doubtful accounts and received payment confirmations from
these clients in the past three quarters. However, some of these clients were heavily impacted by
the economic downturn in 2009. The Company received partial payments from some of these clients in
the first quarter of 2010 while others still have not made payment so far.

Since the Company issued the earnings release for the unaudited results for the fourth quarter of
the year ended December 31, 2009 on March 1, 2010, the Company has made an additional provision for
doubtful accounts of US$9.3 million in respect of balances outstanding at December 31, 2009 and has
consequently revised its unaudited results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December
31, 2009 to a net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$19.4 million for the fourth
quarter of 2009 and a net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders of US$37.2 million for
fiscal year 2009 with a corresponding reduction in shareholders’ equity, which was reduced to
US$263.0 million. These adjustments were made as a result of a further review by management of
specific outstanding balances from certain customers with whom AirMedia had started to do business
in 2009 and who are experiencing difficulty in collecting payments from their own customers and
hence have not paid AirMedia.


Since the first quarter of 2010, the Company has adopted a stricter credit policy and procedures
which are designed to ensure a solid background check and credit review before the Company accepts
new customers, and has also required sufficient advance payments from the new customers before the
Company provides advertisement service. The Company hopes to mitigate risks associated with bad
debts in the future with these new credit policy and procedures in place.

    We define a time slot as a 30-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital TV screens in
airports and digital TV screens on airplanes, which is shown during each advertising cycle on a
weekly basis in a given airport or on a monthly basis on the routes of a given airline, respectively. Our airport
advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a given week in one-hour cycles
and each hour of programming includes 25 minutes of advertising content, which allows us to sell a
maximum of 50 time slots per week. The number of time slots available for our digital TV screens in
airports during the period presented is calculated by multiplying the time slots per week per
airport by the number of weeks during the period presented when we had operations in each airport
and then calculating the sum of all the time slots available for each of our network airports. The
length of our in-flight programs typically ranges from approximately 45 minutes to an hour per
flight, approximately five to 13 minutes of which consist of advertising content. The number of
time slots available for our digital TV screens on airplanes during the period presented is
calculated by multiplying the time slots per airline per month by the number of months during the
period presented when we had operations on each airline and then calculating the sum of all the
time slots for each of our network airlines.

    (2)
     
    We define a time slot as a 12-second equivalent advertising time unit for digital frames in
airports, which is shown during each standard advertising cycle on a weekly basis in a given
airport. Our standard airport advertising programs are shown repeatedly on a daily basis during a
given week in 10-minute cycles, which allows us to sell a maximum of 50 time slots per week. The
length of time slot and advertising program cycle of some digital frames in several airports are
different from standard ones. The number of time slots available for our digital frames in airports
during the period presented is calculated by multiplying the time slots per week per airport by the
number of weeks during the period presented when we had operations in each airport and then
calculating the sum of all the time slots available for each of our network airports.


 


    (3)
     
    Number of time slots sold refers to the number of 30-second equivalent advertising time units
for digital TV screens in airports and digital TV screens on airplanes or 12-second equivalent
advertising time units for digital frames in airports sold during the period presented.


 


    (4)
     
    Utilization rate refers to total time slots sold as a percentage of total time slots available
for sale during the relevant period.


 


    (5)
     
    Average advertising revenue per time slot sold for digital TV screens in airports, digital TV
screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports is calculated by dividing our revenues derived
from digital TV screens in airports, digital TV screens on airplanes and digital frames in airports
by its own number of time slots sold, respectively.


 


    (6)
     
    We define the number of locations available for sale in traditional media as the sum of (1) the
number of light boxes and billboards in Beijing, Shenzhen, Wenzhou and certain other airports
(light boxes and billboards), and (2) the number of gate bridges in 10 airports (gate bridges).


 


    (7)
     
    The number of locations sold is defined as the sum of (1) the number of light boxes and
billboards sold and (2) the number of gate bridges sold. To calculate the number of light boxes and
billboards sold in a given airport, we first calculate the “utilization rates of light boxes and
billboards” in such airport by dividing the “total value of light boxes and billboards sold” in
such airport by the “total value of light boxes and billboards” in such airport. The “total value
of light boxes and billboards sold” in a given airport is calculated as the daily listing prices of
each light boxes and billboards sold multiplied by their respective number of days sold during the
period presented. The “total value of light boxes and billboards” in a given airport is calculated
as the sum of quarterly listing prices of all the light boxes and billboards during the period
presented. The number of light boxes and billboards sold in a given airport is then calculated as
the number of light boxes and billboards available for sale in such airport multiplied by the
utilization rates of light boxes and billboards in such airport. The number of gate bridges sold in
a given airport is counted based on the contracts.


 


    (8)
     
    Utilization rate refers to total locations sold as a percentage of total locations available
for sale during the period presented.


 


    (9)
     
    Average advertising revenue per location sold is calculated by dividing the revenues derived
from all the locations sold by the number of locations sold during the period presented.





Other Recent Developments



AirMedia adjusted upward its listing prices of its 108 stand-alone digital frames at Terminals 2
and 3 of Beijing Capital International Airport, its TV-attached digital frames at Terminal 2 of
Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, and its digital TV screens on Air China’s airplanes by 30%
and its Mega-size LED screens in the Guangzhou airport by 25% during most or all of the following
periods: the National Day period from September 24, 2010 to October 21, 2010, the 16th
Asian Games from November 5, 2010 to December 2, 2010, and the 2011 Spring Festival from January 28, 2011 to February 24, 2011.

AirMedia renewed its concession rights contract with Beijing Capital Airport Advertising Co., Ltd.
at the same price as in its previous contract to continue operating digital TV screens at Terminals
1 and 2 of the Beijing airport from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.


In March, 2010, AirMedia entered into a supplementary agreement to its concession rights contract
with JCDecaux Momentum Shanghai Airport Advertising Co., Ltd. to exclusively operate 76 digital TV
screens and 152 TV-attached digital frames at Terminal 2 of the Hongqiao airport, a newly open
terminal, which further enhanced AirMedia’s ability to meet strong advertising demand in Shanghai.
AirMedia also has exclusive rights to operate 30 stand-alone digital frames at Terminal 2 of the
Hongqiao airport obtained in the original concession rights contract signed in August 2009.
AirMedia started to sell advertising time slots available on the media at Terminal 2 of the
Hongqiao airport on March 25, 2010.


Following its increase in the listing prices of stand-alone digital frames in the two Shanghai
airports in October 2009, AirMedia also increased its listing prices of digital TV screens and
stand-alone digital frames in the Shanghai airports on March 10, 2010, in response to the opening
of Terminal 2 of the Hongqiao airport. AirMedia increased the listing price of digital TV screens
in Shanghai by 32% per time slot. AirMedia sells its stand-alone digital frames at Terminal 2 of
the Hongqiao airport separately from its media at Terminal 1 of the Hongqiao airport and Shanghai
Pudong International Airport. This approach has the effect of a 77% increase in its listing prices
for advertisers aiming to cover all air travelers in Shanghai using AirMedia’s stand-alone digital
frames.


Starting from January 2010, AirMedia increased the listing prices of its TV-attached digital frames
in the Beijing and Guangzhou airports by 20% to 30%.


Starting from January 2010, AirMedia increased its listing prices of digital TV screens on Air
China’s airplanes by 20%.


Business Outlook 



As a result of current business visibility, without taking into account the revenue contribution
from gas station network in the second half of 2010, AirMedia currently expects that its total
revenues for fiscal year 2010 will range from US$230.0 million to US$250.0 million, representing a
year-over-year increase of 50.8% to 63.9% from fiscal year 2009.


AirMedia currently expects that its total revenues for the second quarter of 2010 will range from
US$55.0 million to US$57.0 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49.4% to 54.8% from
the same period in 2009.


AirMedia currently expects that concession fees will be at least US$34.5 million in the second
quarter of 2010. The anticipated quarter-over-quarter increase in concession fees is primarily
attributable to full-quarter concession fees of the media at Terminal 2 of Shanghai Hongqiao
International Airport, the concession fees associated with outdoor advertising platform in some
additional Sinopec service stations, the anticipated increase in concession fees to Air China and
China Southern Airlines due to overselling the advertising time on their airplanes, and concession
fee commitments under additional concession rights contracts expected to be entered into in the
near future.


The above forecast reflects AirMedia’s current and preliminary view and is therefore subject to
change. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement below for the factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



AirMedia’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of AirMedia’s
comparative operating performance and future prospects. AirMedia’s non-GAAP financial measures
exclude the following non-cash items: (1) share-based compensation expenses, and (2) amortization
of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by AirMedia’s management in
their financial and operating decision-making, because management believes they reflect AirMedia’s
ongoing business and operating performance in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period
comparisons. AirMedia’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful
information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating AirMedia’s operating
performance in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. Specifically, AirMedia
believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and
investors by excluding certain charges that the Company believes are not indicative of its core
operating results.


The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. They do not include all items of income and
expense that affect AirMedia’s income from operations. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies and, with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude
certain items under GAAP, do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer to AirMedia.
Management compensates for these limitations by also considering AirMedia’s financial results as
determined in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to
be considered superior to, in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance
with US GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table
captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income(Loss) and EPS and Non-GAAP Adjusted Income(Loss) and EPS”, “Reconciliation of GAAP Operating
Expenses to Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses” and “Reconciliation of GAAP Income (Loss) from
Operations to Non-GAAP Adjusted Income (Loss) from Operations” set forth at the end of this
release.

harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“future,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “confident” and similar statements. Among other
things, the Business Outlook section and the quotations from management in this announcement, as
well as AirMedia Group Inc.’s strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements.
AirMedia may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases
and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to
third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about AirMedia’s
beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve
inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to: if advertisers or the viewing public do not accept,
or lose interest in, our air travel advertising network, we may be unable to generate sufficient
cash flow from our operating activities and our prospects and results of operations could be
negatively affected; we derive most of our revenues from the provision of air travel advertising
services, and any slowdown in the air travel advertising industry in China may materially and
adversely affect our revenues and results of operation; our strategy of expanding our advertising
network by expanding into traditional media and building new media platforms may not succeed, and
our failure to do so could materially reduce the attractiveness of our network and harm our
business, reputation and results of operations; if our customers reduce their advertising spending
or are unable to pay us in full, in part or at all for a period of time due to an economic downturn
in China and/or elsewhere or for any other reason, our revenues and results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected; we face risks related to health epidemics such as the H1N1 flu,
which could materially and adversely affect air travel and result in reduced demand for our
advertising services or disrupt our operations; if we are unable to retain existing concession
rights contracts or obtain new concession rights contracts on commercially advantageous terms that
allow us to operate our advertising platforms, we may be unable to maintain or expand our network
coverage and our business and prospects may be harmed; a significant portion of our revenues has
been derived from the five largest airports and three largest airlines in China, and if any of
these airports or airlines experiences a material business disruption, our ability to generate
revenues and our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected; our limited
operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations;
and other risks outlined in AirMedia’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
AirMedia does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as
required under applicable law.
