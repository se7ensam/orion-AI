Attached herewith as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release, issued on January 13,
2010, whereby Acergy S.A. (the "Company") announced that an Extraordinary
Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") will take place at the offices of SGG
S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg on Tuesday February 16, 2010 at
12.00 p.m. local time for the purpose of considering resolution 1 of the
December 17, 2009 Extraordinary General Meeting Agenda.

It was noted at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on December
17, 2009 that the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for
resolution 1 was not present and this Meeting was therefore not able to consider
this resolution.

The Board of Directors therefore decided to call an Extraordinary General
Meeting to consider resolution 1. At this Meeting there is no requirement for
quorum. However, to approve the proposed resolution a 2/3rd majority of the
votes cast at the Meeting will be required.

Proxies already received for the December 17, 2009 Extraordinary General Meeting
remain valid for this Meeting and Shareholders of record as of October 30, 2009
are entitled to vote at the Meeting. Those Shareholders who have not yet cast
their votes may do so by submitting the proxy card as instructed, or
alternatively may attend the Meeting at the above address. The new deadline for
submission of votes for American Depositary Receipt holders is February 8, 2010
and for holders of Common Shares February 9, 2010.

Upon publication, the supporting materials for this meeting will be available on
the Acergy website: www.acergy-group.com/public/February2010EGM

Certain statements set forth above and contained in the press release and above
materials furnished pursuant to this Form 6-K may include "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be
identified by the use of words like "anticipate," "believe," "estimate,"
"expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "project," "will," "should," "seek," and
similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to,
statements as to the expected timing of, record date for and purposes of the
Meeting and the date of publication and distribution of materials to eligible
shareholders. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and
assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors,
and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual
and future results and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking
statements: our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general
economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we
operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal
proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating
internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion
of ship conversion programs; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating
hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are
beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you should not
place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.
