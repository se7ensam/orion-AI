<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This document contains certain statements that may be deemed &#147;forward-looking statements&#148;. All statements in this document, other than statements of historical fact, that address future production, reserve potential, exploration drilling, exploitation activities and events or developments that the Company expects to occur, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words &#147;expects&#148;, &#147;plans&#148; &#147;anticipates&#148;, &#147;believes&#148;, &#147;intends&#148;, &#147;estimates&#148;, &#147;projects&#148;, &#147;potential&#148; and similar expressions, or that events or conditions &#147;will&#148;, &#147;would&#148;, &#147;may&#148;, &#147;could&#148; or &#147;should&#148; occur. Information inferred from the interpretation of drilling results and information concerning mineral resource estimates may also be deemed to be forward looking state
ments, as it constitutes a prediction of what might be found to be present when and if a project is actually developed. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include market prices, exploitation and exploration successes, and continued availability of capital and financing, and general economic, market or business conditions. Investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Except for the statements of historical fact contained herein, certain information presented constitutes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, those with respect to potential expansion of mineralization, potential size of mineralized zone, timing of resource calculation and size of exploration program involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievement of Alberta Star Development Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, risks related to international operations and joint ventures, the actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations, uncertainty in the estimation o
f ore reserves and mineral resources, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, future prices of gold, silver, uranium and base metals, environmental risks and hazards, increased infrastructure and/or operating costs, labor and employment matters, aboriginal and government regulation and permitting requirements as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Company&#146;s latest Form 20-F on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>OVERVIEW AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Alberta Star Development Corp. is a Canadian Mineral Exploration Company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of exploration properties in Canada&#146;s Northwest Territories (&#147;NT&#148;). These properties are in the exploration stage. The Company does not generate income or cash flow from its operations. The Company&#146;s outlook is dependent on the global demand for the minerals that it is seeking on its properties, namely base and precious metals, including gold, silver, copper, cobalt, lead, zinc and uranium.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company delayed its 2009 exploration program due to unfavourable market conditions and high field costs related to working in the Northwest Territories. During the Summer of 2009, the Company demobilized its exploration camp at Echo Bay, NT. The Company intends to monitor and provide updates on its future exploration programs as market conditions change. The Company continues to reduce its overhead and look for additional avenues to conserve its working capital with the intent of acquiring an economic mineral deposit. The Company has a strong balance sheet, no debt, is focused on cost cutting and maintaining qualified management. The Company continues its search to acquire and develop a world class advanced stage exploration and production project. As a result of the uncertainty in the ongoing global economic crisis, the Company expects there to be a notable reduction in capital available to the resource industry for a number of years to come, and the Company intends to man
age its cash resources and review opportunities as the economic circumstances demand. The Company has and continues to conduct due diligence reviews on a number of resource opportunities, including a number of advanced stage mineral exploration projects that meet the Company&#146;s corporate mandate of acquiring opportunities with established resources, expansion potential, infrastructure, cash flow and near term cash flow.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">To this end, on June 10, 2009, the Company filed a &#147;Notice of Appearance and Request for Special Notice&#148; with the United States Bankruptcy court for the District of Idaho regarding the Sterling Mining Company (&#147;Sterling&#148;) and its corporate assets situated in the Coeur d&#146;Alene, Idaho mining district.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On July 3, 2009, the Company issued 790,000 stock options to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company with an exercise price of $1.00 per share for a period of five years.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As at September 4, 2009, the Company continued to be a party of interest with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Idaho in the matter regarding Sterling and its corporate assets situated in the Coeur d&#146;Alene, Idaho mining district, Idaho, USA. As a party of interest, the Company is interested in pursuing options with the debtor, Sterling and its related assets.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On November 2, 2009, the Company announced that it has entered into a binding term sheet with Sterling whereby the Company has entered into a binding agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Sterling and its assets and provide for financing of Sterling&#146;s ongoing operations.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On November 4, 2009, the Company issued 100,000 stock options with an exercise price of $1.00 per share for a period of five years to Progressive IR Consultants Corp, an investor relations and corporate communications service provider. These options vest quarterly beginning on March 4, 2010.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On December 1, 2009, the Company announced that it has entered into a formal acquisition agreement with Sterling whereby the Company has entered into a binding agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Sterling and its assets and provide for financing of Sterling&#146;s ongoing operations.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On March 8, 2010, the Company announced that it has entered into a letter agreement with Kootenay Gold Inc. (&#147;Kootenay&#148;), whereby the Company and Kootenay have agreed to cooperate in a joint bid to acquire a 100% interest in Sterling and its assets, and provide for financing of Sterling&#146;s continuing operations and development.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On March 10, 2010, the Company announced that the 5 for 1 share consolidation that was approved by the Board of Directors and at the February 8, 2010 annual and special meeting will be effective March 11, 2010.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><U>STERLING MINING COMPANY</U></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Sterling is currently a debtor-in-possession in Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the District of Idaho, U.S.A. Sterling is engaged in the business of acquiring, exploring, developing and mining mineral properties primarily those containing silver and associated base and precious metals. Sterling operates the Sunshine Silver Mine in Idaho and has exploration projects in Idaho, U.S.A. Sterling was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho on February 3, 1903 and its common shares are currently listed on the OTCBB: SRLMQ and Frankfurt Stock Exchange: SMX.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><U>THE SUNSHINE SILVER MINE</U></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Sunshine Mine is located near Coeur d&#146;Alene Idaho, U.S.A. and has been one of the world&#146;s largest producers of silver, having recorded production of over 360 million ounces of silver since 1904. A 2007 Canadian &#147;National Instrument 43-101- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects&#148;, report by Behre Dolbear &amp; Company estimated remaining resources as follows: Measured and Indicated resources of 31.51 million ounces of silver in 1.43 million tons at 21.8 ounces of silver per ton; Inferred resources of 231.5 million ounces of silver in 2.28 million tons at 101.6 ounces of silver per ton. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources, the issuer is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources and the historical estimate should not be relied upon. The Report can be found under Sterling&#146;s profile with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available in C
anada at www.sedar.com.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><U>TERMS OF ACQUISITION OF STERLING</U></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On June 10, 2009, the Company filed a &#147;Notice of Appearance and Request for Special Notice&#148; with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Idaho, U.S.A. (the &#147;<B>Court</B>&#148;) regarding Sterling. Since the filing of the Notice, the Company has monitored the bankruptcy proceedings of Sterling and pursued various financing options with Sterling, which has resulted in the Agreement which would allow the Company to gain control of Sterling and its assets. The Agreement contains a number of conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties. Unless all of such conditions are satisfied or waived by the party for whose benefit such conditions exist, to the extent that they may be capable of waiver, the proposed transaction will not proceed. There is no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied or waived on a timely basis, or at all. Such conditions include: an order (&#147;<B>Order</B>&#148;) of the Court approving the Plan of reorganization of
 Sterling; all claims of all the creditors of Sterling are paid, satisfied, settled or compromised under the Plan of reorganization and that all other consents and approvals, including regulatory approvals, are obtained.

In addition, the Company has agreed to make available up to US$1,250,000 (US$250,000 per month) in interim term debtor-in-possession financing to Sterling, which amount will bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum, bringing the total value of the agreement to US$11,750,000. The Agreement prohibits Sterling from soliciting or initiating any discussion regarding any other business combination or sale of material assets, contains provisions for the Company to match competing, unsolicited proposals and provides for a US$250,000 termination fee payable to the Company under certain circumstances.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It is the Company&#146;s objective, subject to Court and Exchange approval, to acquire 100% of the remaining authorized, but un-issued, common shares of Sterling, and for Sterling to exit the Chapter 11 process with the following assets in place: its interest in the Sunshine Mine, facilities, and lease, and exploration interest in the Sterling exploration projects in Idaho.

The radiometric maps show a well defined uranium anomaly with a marked correlation of strong thorium (Th) and potassium (k) ratio patterns. The Eldorado South Anomaly has never been drill tested. The Eldorado South Anomaly was discovered as a result of the completion of a High Resolution, Multi-Parameter Regional radiometric and magnetic geophysical survey which was conducted in July 2006. The survey consisted of 16,708 line-kilometers at 100 meter line-spacing&#146;s. The purpose of the radiometric survey was to measure the gamma radiation field and locate prospective areas of high-grade uranium and poly-metallic deposition.</P>

The significant changes during the current fiscal period compared to the same period a year prior are as follows:</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Advertising and promotion expenses decreased to $30,649 during the year ended November 30, 2009 from the $265,378 during the same period a year prior. The decrease in advertising and promotion is primarily attributable to a reduction in advertising costs and news release dissemination.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Filing and financing fees increased to $153,211 for the year ended November 30, 2009 from $119,881 for the year ended November 30, 2008. The increase in costs is attributed to a general increase in fees associated with regulatory authorities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Part XII.6 tax for the year ended November 30, 2009 was $7,392 as compared to $711,124 for the year ended November 30, 2008.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Legal and accounting fees decreased to $332,372 for the year ended November 30, 2009, from $349,567 for the year ended November 30, 2008. The legal and accounting fees were relatively the same as the previous year due mainly to legal fees paid to the Company&#146;s legal counsels in Alberta, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories for the Company&#146;s Annual General Meeting, and other general corporate matters.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Office and miscellaneous expenses for the year ended November 30, 2009 were $81,910 as compared to $136,414 in the prior year. The current year office expenses were less due to reduced office overhead associated with the exploration programs.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Salaries and benefits for the year ended November 30, 2009 were $479,878 as compared to $575,269 for the year ended November 30, 2008.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Transfer fees and shareholder information costs decreased to $279,242 for the year ended November 30, 2009 from $477,635 for the year ended November 30, 2008. The decrease in transfer fees and shareholder information costs period over period is due mainly to decrease in fees and number of consultants and analysts used for the Company&#146;s investor relations and corporate development activities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Travel expenses decreased to $70,266 during the year ended November 30, 2009 from $94,848 during the same period a year prior. This was due to decreased expenditures on trade show attendances and conferences during the current year.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Interest income decreased to $166,287 for the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to $767,768 during the same period a year prior primarily due to lower interest rates being paid on deposits during the current year.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The preparation of the Company&#146;s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the determination of impairment of equipment, environmental and reclamation obligations, rates for amortization and variables used in determining stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on management&#146;s best judgment. Factors that could affect these estimates include risks inherent in mineral exploration and development, changes in reclamation requirements, changes in government policy and changes in foreign exchange rates.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Management has assessed the carrying value of its assets and does not believe the remaining assets have suffered any impairment.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company does not believe it has incurred any material environmental liabilities to date. The Company has the responsibility to perform reclamation in certain jurisdictions upon completion of drilling. The costs to complete this reclamation are immaterial and are expensed when incurred.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Management has made significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair market value of stock-based compensation granted to employees and non-employees and the value attributed to various warrants and broker warrants issued on financings. These estimates have an effect on the stock-based compensation expense recognized and the contributed surplus and share capital balances on the Company&#146;s balance sheet. Management has made estimates of the life of stock options and warrants, the expected volatility and expected dividend yields that could materially affect the fair market value of these types of securities. The estimates were chosen after reviewing the historical life of the Company&#146;s options and analyzing share price history to determine volatility.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Effective 1 December 2008, the Company adopted CICA Handbook Section 3064, &#147;<I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>&#148;. The new requirements of Section 3064 are for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. Section 3064 replaces Section 3062, &#147;<I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>&#148;. The new standard establishes revised standards for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of goodwill and intangible assets. The new standard also provides guidance for the treatment of preproduction and start-up costs and requires that these costs be expensed as incurred.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On 20 January 2009, the Emerging Issues Committee (&#147;EIC&#148;) of the AcSB issued EIC Abstract 173, &#147;<I>Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</I>&#148;, which establishes that an entity&#146;s own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparty should be taken into account in determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivative instruments. EIC 173 should be applied retrospectively without restatement of prior years to all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in interim and annual financial statements for periods ending on or after 20 January 2009.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>Mining Exploration Costs</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On 27 March 2009, the EIC of the AcSB issued EIC Abstract 174, &#147;<I>Mining Exploration Costs</I>&#148;, which provides guidance on capitalization of exploration costs related to mining properties. It also provides guidance for development and exploration stage entities that cannot estimate future cash flows from its properties in assessing whether impairment in such properties is required. EIC 174 is to be applied retrospectively without restatement of prior periods in interim and annual financial statements for periods ending on or after 27 March 2009.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In 2001, the CICA issued Accounting Guideline No. 11, which covers the Company&#146;s exploration activities. In the past, the Company has capitalized certain exploration costs on mineral properties that were not covered by feasibility studies, whereas under the new guideline, the Company was required to expense these amounts in the year incurred. Effective 1 January 2001, the Company adopted these new recommendations on a retroactive basis. The impact as at 1 January 2001 of the adoption of these new recommendations was to reduce mineral properties by $561,257 and to increase deficit, accumulated during the exploration stage by $561,257.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>Business Combinations</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In January 2009, the CICA issued Handbook Section 1582, &#147;<I>Business Combinations</I>&#148;, which replaces Section 1581, &#147;<I>Business Combinations</I>&#148;, and provides the equivalent to IFRS 3, &#147;<I>Business Combinations</I>&#148; (January 2008). The new Section expands the definition of a business subject to an acquisition and establishes significant new guidance on the measurement of consideration given, and the recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.</P>

<BR>
<!--$$/page=-->
<A name="page_14"></A><BR>
<DIV style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0%; PADDING-LEFT: 0%">
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The new Section requires that all business acquisitions be measured at the full fair value of the acquired entity at the acquisition date even if the business combination is achieved in stages, or if less than 100 percent of the equity interest in the acquiree is owned at the acquisition date. The measurement of equity consideration given in a business combination will no longer be based on the average of the fair value of the shares a few days before and after the day the terms and conditions have been agreed to and the acquisition announced, but rather at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability will be recognized in earnings and not as an adjustment to the purchase price.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Restructuring and other direct costs of a business combination are no longer considered part of the acquisition accounting. Instead, such costs will be expensed as incurred, unless they constitute the costs associated with issuing debt or equity securities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Section applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2011. Earlier adoption is permitted.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>Consolidated Financial Statements and Non-Controlling Interests</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In January 2009, the CICA issued Handbook Section 1601, &#147;<I>Consolidated Financial Statements</I>&#148; and Section 1602, &#147;<I>Non-Controlling Interests</I>&#148;, which together replace Section 1600, &#147;<I>Consolidated Financial Statements</I>&#148;. These two Sections are the equivalent to the corresponding provisions of International Accounting Standard 27, &#147;<I>Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements</I>&#148; (January 2008). Section 1602 applies to the accounting for non-controlling interests and transactions with non-controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements. The new Sections require that, for each business combination, the acquirer measure any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest&#146;s proportionate share of the acquiree&#146;s identifiable net assets. The new Sections also require non-controlling interest to be presented as a separate component of shareholders&#14
6; equity.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Under Section 1602, non-controlling interest in income is not deducted in arriving at consolidated net income or other comprehensive income. Rather, net income and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to the controlling and non-controlling interests based on relative ownership interests. These Sections apply to interim and annual consolidated financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011, and should be adopted concurrently with Section 1582.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>International Financial Reporting Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;)</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In 2006, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (&#147;AcSB&#148;) published a new strategic plan that will significantly affect financial reporting requirements for Canadian companies. The AcSB strategic plan outlines the convergence of Canadian GAAP with IFRS over an expected five year transitional period. In February 2008, the AcSB announced that 2011 is the changeover date for publicly-listed companies to use IFRS, replacing Canada&#146;s own GAAP. The date is for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The transition date of 1 January 2011 will require the restatement for comparative purposes of amounts reported by the Company for the year ended 30 November 2011. While the Company has begun assessing the adoption of IFRS for 2011, the financial reporting impact of the transition to IFRS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Fair value - The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Exchange risk - The Company operates solely in Canada and therefore is subject to minimal foreign currency risk arising from changes in exchange rates with other currencies.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Interest rate risk - The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short-term investments, but this risk relates only to investments held to fund future activities and does not affect the Company&#146;s current operating activities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Credit risk - The Company places its temporary investment funds with government and bank debt securities and is subject to minimal credit risk with regard to temporary investments.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company does not have any risk associated with &#147;other instruments&#148;; that is, instruments that may be settled by the delivery of non-financial assets.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company believes that the following items represent significant areas for consideration.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Cash Flows and Additional Funding Requirements</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company has limited financial resources, no sources of operating cash flows and no assurances that sufficient funding, including adequate financing, will be available. If the Company&#146;s exploration programs are successful, additional funds will be required in order to complete the development of its properties. The sources of funds currently available to the Company include; raising equity or debt capital, or offering an interest in its projects to another party. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising sufficient funds to conduct further exploration and development of its projects or to fulfill its obligations under the terms of any option or joint venture agreements, in which case the Company may have to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development, or forfeit its interest in its properties or prospects.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Industry</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company is engaged in the exploration of mineral properties, an inherently risky business. There is no assurance that funds spent on the exploration and development of a mineral deposit will result in the discovery of an economic ore body. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Commodity Prices</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The profitability of the Company&#146;s operations will be dependent upon the market price of mineral commodities. Mineral prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company. The prices of mineral commodities have fluctuated widely in recent years. Current and future price declines could cause commercial production to be impracticable. The Company&#146;s revenues and earnings also could be affected by the prices of other commodities such as fuel and other consumable items, although to a lesser extent than by the price of mineral commodities.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Competition</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases, and the Company competes with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than itself with respect to the discovery and acquisition of interests in mineral properties, the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and other persons to carry out its mineral exploration activities. Competition in the mining industry could adversely affect the Company&#146;s prospects for mineral exploration in the future.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Government Laws, Regulation &amp; Permitting</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Mining and exploration activities of the Company are subject to domestic laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, production, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, mine safety, waste disposal, toxic substances, the environment and other matters. Although the Company believes that all exploration activities are currently carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations, no assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing the operations and activities of the Company or more stringent implementation thereof could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The operations of the Company will require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities to carry out exploration and development at its projects. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary licences and permits on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. Any failure to comply with permits and applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption or closure of operations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Title to Properties</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Acquisition of rights to the mineral properties is a very detailed and time-consuming process. Title to, and the area of, mineral properties may be disputed. To the best of the Company's knowledge, the Company has title to all of the properties for which it holds mineral leases or licenses or in respect of which it has a right to earn an interest, however, the Company cannot give an assurance that title to such properties will not be challenged or impugned.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company has the right to earn an increased interest in some of its properties. To earn this increased interest in each property, the Company is required to make certain cash payments. If the Company fails to make these payments, the Company may lose its right to such properties and forfeit any funds expended to such time.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Estimates of Mineral Resources</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The mineral resource estimates used by the Company are estimates only and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery of minerals will in fact be realized or that an identified resource will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) deposit which can be legally or commercially exploited. In addition, the grade of mineralization ultimately mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results and such differences could be material.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Key Management</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The success of the Company will be largely dependent upon the performance of its key officers, consultants and employees. Locating mineral deposits depends on a number of factors, not the least of which is the technical skill of the exploration personnel involved. The success of the Company is largely dependent on the performance of its key individuals. Failure to retain key individuals or to attract or retain additional key individuals with necessary skills could have a materially adverse impact upon the Company&#146;s success.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Volatility of Share Price</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Market prices for shares of early stage companies are often volatile. Factors such as announcements of mineral discoveries, financial results, and other factors could have a significant effect on the price of the Company&#146;s shares.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><I>Conflict of Interest</I></B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Some of the Company&#146;s directors and officers are directors and officers of other natural resource or mining-related companies. These associations may give rise from time to time to conflicts of interest. As a result of such conflicts, the Company could potentially miss the opportunity to participate in certain transactions or opportunities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>SHARE DATA</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As of March 29, 2010, the Company has 21,403,979 common shares without par value issued and outstanding. In addition, the Company has the obligation to issue the following additional common shares:</P>
