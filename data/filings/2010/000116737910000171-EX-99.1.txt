HUENENBERG, Switzerland – October 20, 2010 – Alcon, Inc. (NYSE:ACL) reported that global sales rose 9.0 percent to $1.76 billion for the third quarter of 2010.  Revenue from acquisitions added 70 basis points to sales growth in the quarter, while foreign currency fluctuations reduced reported sales growth by 40 basis points.

Net earnings for the third quarter of 2010 declined 13.4 percent to $446 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, compared to $515 million, or $1.71 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009.  Reported net earnings in the third quarter of 2010 include $113 million in after-tax other operating expenses related to the change of majority ownership and merger proposal from Novartis AG.  Excluding these expenses, non-GAAP adjusted net earnings would have grown 8.5 percent to $559 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 net earnings.  Reconciliations of reported and adjusted results for the third quarter are included in the financial tables below.

“Alcon’s operational and financial performance in the third quarter clearly demonstrates our ability to combine our commercial capabilities and global scale to achieve sustainable organic growth.  Once again, we have delivered high-quality results from our core operations, supplemented by strong growth from our recent acquisitions,” said Kevin Buehler, Alcon’s president and chief executive officer.  “With the solid results posted in the first three quarters of the year, we are on track to deliver against our full-year revenue and profit guidance.”




Sales Highlights

Summarized below are sales highlights for the third quarter of 2010. All growth comparisons are for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. Organic sales growth rates exclude currency impacts and acquisitions and are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled in a table at the end of this release.





Ø  


U.S. sales increased 9.5 percent to $803 million, led by sales of pharmaceutical products, which grew 19.1 percent.








o  


The severe summer otic season lifted sales of CIPRODEX® otic suspension by 37.5 percent.




 



  



  

  



  



 





o  


The recent acquisitions of Optonol and DUREZOL® ophthalmic steroid added 160 basis points of growth.








Ø  


Sales in international markets rose 9.3 percent on an organic basis (+8.6 percent reported) to $957 million with balanced contributions from most global markets.








o  


Sales in emerging markets increased 19.2 percent organically (+20.2 percent reported), led by the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China), which together rose 20.5 percent on an organic basis (+25.6 percent reported).








o  


International pharmaceutical sales increased 12.5 percent organically (+11.0 percent reported) on broad-based growth across most therapeutic categories.








Ø  


Global sales of pharmaceutical products increased 14.2 percent on an organic basis (+15.0 percent reported) to $758 million, primarily due to continued solid global performance of the glaucoma franchise and a severe otic season in the United States.








o  


Global glaucoma sales rose 11.5 percent organically (+10.5 percent reported) led by strong growth of DuoTrav® ophthalmic solution and continued market penetration of AZARGA® ophthalmic suspension outside the United States.








Ø  


Global surgical sales were $767 million, an increase of 3.7 percent on an organic basis (+3.8 percent reported).








o  


Global sales of advanced technology intraocular lenses rose 13.6 percent organically (+13.5 percent reported) on continued adoption and utilization by cataract surgeons of the AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR® +3.0 and AcrySof® IQ Toric intraocular lenses.








Ø  


Global sales of consumer eye care products rose 8.8 percent on an organic basis (+8.8 percent reported) to $235 million on the strong global performance the Systane® family of lubricant eye drops.








o  


Launch of Systane® BALANCE lubricant eye drops in the United States contributed to strong performance in the artificial tear category, which rose 19.2 percent organically (+17.8 percent reported).







Earnings Highlights

Summarized below are earnings highlights for the third quarter of 2010. All growth comparisons are for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009.





Ø  


Gross profit margin was consistent with management expectations at 76.0 percent compared to 75.3 percent in 2009.  The increase was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in each period and positive price contribution.








Ø  


Operating income declined 14.4 percent to $495 million, or 28.1 percent of sales.  Non-GAAP adjusted operating income would have increased 8.7 percent to $628 million, or 35.7 percent of sales.  This performance was attributable to solid sales growth, positive price contribution, the temporary favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on gross profit and SG&A leverage.  The solid growth in operating profit was achieved while increasing spending on value creating commercial activities and growing R&D spending by over 16 percent.  Adjusted operating income in the third quarter of 2010 excludes $133 million in other operating expenses related to the change of majority ownership and merger proposal from Novartis.








Ø  


Net earnings declined 13.4 percent to $446 million, or $1.47 per diluted share.  Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings would have risen 8.5 percent to $559 million, or $1.84 per diluted share.  Adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2010 exclude $113 million of after-tax costs related to the change of majority ownership and merger proposal from Novartis.  In addition to the positive operational factors noted above, the growth in adjusted net earnings was reduced by a decline in interest and other income related to




 

 



  



  

  



  







  


the company’s investment portfolio and the expiration of the U.S. Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.




 

Other Highlights





Ø  


The company received regulatory approval and completed the acquisition of LenSx Lasers, Inc., a laser device company that has developed a customizable, image-guided femtosecond laser to perform certain steps during cataract surgery, including anterior capsulorhexis and lens fragmentation.  The LenSx femtosecond laser was the first such laser to receive United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for use as a part of cataract surgery.








Ø  


The company commenced the launch of the AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR® Toric intraocular lens for the correction of both presbyopia and astigmatism outside the United States.   This new intraocular lens provides presbyopic correction for cataract patients who have pre-existing astigmatism without the need for additional surgical procedures.








Ø  


The company launched TobraDex® ST ophthalmic suspension, a topical antibiotic and corticosteroid combination, in the United States.  TobraDex® ST is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular 
infection exists.








Ø  


The company introduced the WaveLight® Refractive Suite outside the United States.  This new refractive suite features the 200 kHz WaveLight® FS-200 femtosecond laser for the creation of corneal flaps during refractive laser surgery and the new 500Hz WaveLight® EX-500 excimer laser.








Ø  


The FDA approved TRAVATAN Z® ophthalmic solution for first-line treatment of elevated intraocular pressure associated with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.








Ø  


On August 26, 2010, Novartis AG and Nestlé S.A. announced they had completed the purchase and sale of approximately 156 million shares of Alcon, Inc. for $28.3 billion in cash.  This purchase made Novartis Alcon’s majority shareholder with ownership of approximately 77 percent of Alcon’s outstanding shares.







Financial Guidance

The company affirmed its full year 2010 guidance for organic sales growth in the high single digits and raised earnings per share guidance to $7.58 to $7.68.  Guidance includes the impact of higher research and development spending than in the third quarter and the potential for additional business development transactions.  It also includes the on-going impact of health care reform, which is expected to reduce full year 2010 sales by $20 million and earnings per share by $0.06.  Guidance excludes costs related to the change of majority ownership to Novartis and the first quarter impact of a change in royalty estimate.  It also excludes the catch-up impact of the change in tax treatment of U.S. retiree medical expenses related to U.S. health care reform. The full year guidance ass
umes renewal of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2010 with retroactive application.

N/M - Not Meaningful

Note: Change in constant currency calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Management believes constant currency sales change is an important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Note: Change in constant currency calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Management believes constant currency sales change is an important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Note: Organic change calculates sales growth without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Management believes organic sales change is an important measure of the company’s operations because it provides investors with a clearer picture of the core rate of sales growth due to changes in unit volumes and local currency prices.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year presentation.
