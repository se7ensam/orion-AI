     ALBERTA STAR ENTERS AGREEMENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN TWO HEAVY OIL WELLS IN LANDROSE, SASKATCHEWAN

      

     
CALGARY, ALBERTA - Alberta Star Development Corp. (TSXV:ASX) (“Alberta Star” or the “Company”) announces that it has entered into a sub-participation agreement with Arctic Hunter Uranium Inc. (“Arctic Hunter”). Under the agreement, Arctic Hunter has agreed to participate with Alberta Star in the two (2) test wells by October 31, 2010. Alberta Star holds a 50% working interest in the Landrose, Saskatchewan assets which form part of the heavy oil assets acquired by Alberta Star on August 6, 2010 from Western Plains Petroleum Ltd. (“Western Plains”). Under the agreement, Arctic Hunter must pay 100% of Alberta Star’s share of the cost to drill, complete and equip or abandon the test wells to earn a (50% net) before payout (BPO), reserving to Alberta Star a convertible overriding royalty of 10% until payout. After payout, Alberta Star has the option to either convert the gross overriding royalty to a 50% working interest (25% net) 
in the two test well spacing units or remain in a gross overriding royalty position. Arctic Hunter has no option to drill post-earning wells under the sub-participation agreement. Both test wells are vertical wells and are expected to be drilled, cased and completed on or before October 31, 2010. Western Plains Petroleum Ltd. will be the operator of the test wells.
The two (2) test wells (C-11, C-14) form part of the Company’s previously announced in-fill drilling program located on section 6-50-25 W3M in Landrose, Saskatchewan. Drilling completion and equipping costs are expected to average $400,000 per well ($200,000 net to Arctic Hunter). The locations of the two (2) in-fill wells are adjacent to the Company’s successful C12-06-50-25 W3M well which was drilled and completed in July 2010 in accordance with a farm-out with Arctic Hunter. The C-12 well is currently producing approximately 80bbls/d gross of heavy oil (4 bbls/d net BPO and 20 bbls/d net APO to the Company).

Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as the term is defined in the Policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
The calculation of barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) are based on a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet (“mcf”) of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil. Boe’s may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl is base on energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
