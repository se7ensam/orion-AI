<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">For immediate release


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>PLUG POWER AND BALLARD EXTEND SUPPLY AGREEMENT THROUGH 2014</B>
<BR>
<I>Mutually exclusive agreement targets North American forklift truck market</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt"><FONT style="font-size: 11pt">LATHAM, NY and VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA &#150; July&nbsp;15, 2010 &#150; Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a
leader in providing clean, reliable energy solutions, and Ballard Power Systems Inc. (TSX: BLD;
NASDAQ: BLDP) announced today that the two companies have extended their existing supply agreement,
effective immediately, through 2014. Ballard will remain the exclusive supplier of fuel cell stacks
for Plug Power&#146;s full suite of GenDrive&#153; power units. In addition, Plug Power will become the
exclusive systems integrator for Ballard&#146;s fuel cell stack into solutions addressing the material
handling market in North America. The previous agreement was due to expire December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</FONT>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">With over 85% market share in the material handling space, this agreement will allow Plug Power and
Ballard continued leadership as the pre-eminent providers of fuel cell energy products in this
industry. This agreement will also help solidify the two company&#146;s joint corporate commitment to
revolutionize the material handling market with highly productive, clean energy technology.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Ballard has been the exclusive fuel cell stack supplier for Plug Power&#146;s GenDrive product line
since 2008. GenDrive is a superior power alternative to lead-acid batteries in electric material
handling vehicles. Using GenDrive, customers in grocery, retail, warehousing and manufacturing
facilities can increase productivity, lower operational costs and decrease greenhouse gas emissions
within their operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Understanding the value provided by GenDrive, leading material handling organizations have
implemented this sustainable power solution in their operations. These customers include Walmart
Canada, United Natural Foods, Inc., Sysco Houston, FedEx Freight, Wegmans, and Whole Foods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">&#147;Ballard and Plug Power&#146;s technology has been integrated, tested and improved over the lifetime of
the GenDrive product to become the world&#146;s most reliable fuel cell power solution for the material
handling industry,&#148; said Andy Marsh, CEO at Plug Power. &#147;This mutual exclusivity positions Ballard
and Plug Power as the industry leaders committed to driving commercial activity and growth.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">John Sheridan, Ballard&#146;s President and CEO, added &#147;We are pleased to extend this supply agreement
with Plug Power for Ballard&#146;s FCvelocity&#174; fuel cell stacks. Our partnership will enable penetration
and growth of fuel cell solutions in the North American material handling market, by delivering
meaningful productivity gains and a strong value proposition to customers.&#148;
