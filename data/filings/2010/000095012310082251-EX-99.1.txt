    3 Conditions precedent and pre-implementation steps










    (b)

precedent in clause 3.1(h) is satisfied in accordance with its terms.



     

    (c)

    (1)
     
    the conditions precedent in clauses 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(d) are satisfied
in accordance with their terms; and



     

     
    (2)
     
    there is no occurrence within the control of AWB or Agrium (as the context
requires) that would prevent the conditions precedent in clause 3.1, which such party
must use best endeavours to satisfy, being satisfied in accordance with their terms.









    (d)
     
    Without limiting this clause 3.2(c), each party must:









     
    (1)
     
    promptly apply for all relevant Regulatory Approvals (as applicable) and
provide to the other a copy of all those applications (provided that any commercially
sensitive information may be redacted from the copy provided);

    Waiver of conditions precedent



     

    (a)
     
    The conditions precedent in clauses 3.1(b), 3.1(c) and 3.1(e) cannot be waived.



     

    (b)
     
    The conditions precedent in clause 3.1(a) and 3.1(d) are for the benefit of Agrium and AWB
and any breach or non-fulfilment of those conditions may only be waived with the written
consent of Agrium and AWB (in their absolute discretion, but only to the extent such waiver is
lawful).



     

    (c)
     
    The conditions precedent in clauses 3.1(f) and 3.1(g) are for the sole benefit of Agrium and
may only be waived by Agrium (in its absolute discretion) in writing.



     

    (d)
     
    The condition precedent in clause 3.1(h) is for the sole benefit of AWB and may only be
waived by AWB (in its absolute discretion) in writing.



     

    (e)
     
    If a party waives the breach or non-fulfilment of any of the conditions precedent in clause
3.1, that waiver does not prevent it from suing the other party for any breach of this deed
that resulted in the breach or non-fulfilment of the condition precedent.



     

    (f)
     
    Waiver of a breach or non-fulfilment in respect of one condition precedent does not
constitute:









     
    (1)
     
    a waiver of breach or non-fulfilment of any other condition precedent
resulting from the same event; or



     

     
    (2)
     
    a waiver of breach or non-fulfilment of that condition precedent resulting
from any other event.









    3.4
     
    Termination on failure of condition precedent



     

    (a)
     
    If:









     
    (1)

    3 Conditions precedent and pre-implementation steps










     
    (2)
     
    any event occurs which would, or in fact does, prevent a condition
precedent in clause 3.1 being satisfied and that condition precedent is not waived by
AWB or Agrium or both (as applicable) in accordance with clause 3.3,






the parties must consult in good faith to:






     
    (3)
     
    determine whether the Transaction may proceed by way of alternative means
or methods;



     

     
    (4)
     
    change the date of the application made to the Court for an order under
section 411(4)(b) of the Corporations Act approving the Scheme or adjourning that
application (as applicable) to another date agreed by AWB and Agrium (being a date no
later than 5 Business Days before the End Date); or



     

     
    (5)
     
    extend the relevant date or End Date.









    (b)
     
    If the parties are unable to reach agreement under clause 3.4(a) within 5 Business Days of
becoming aware of the relevant occurrence or relevant date or by the End Date, then unless
that condition precedent is waived by AWB or Agrium as provided in clause 3.3, either party
may terminate this deed without any liability (except under clause 11, if applicable) to the
other party because of that termination, unless the relevant occurrence or the failure of the
condition precedent to be satisfied, or of the Scheme to become Effective, arises out of a
breach by the terminating party of clause 5 or this clause 3.



     

    (c)
     
    Subject to any rights or obligations arising under or pursuant to clauses that are expressed
to survive termination, on termination of this deed, no party shall have any rights against or
obligations to any other party under this deed except for those rights and obligations which
accrued prior to termination.



     

    (d)
     
    If the condition in clause 3.1(c) is not satisfied only because of a failure to obtain the
majority required by section 411(4)(a)(ii)(A) of the Corporations Act, then either party may
by written notice within 3 Business Days after the date of the conclusion of the Scheme
Meeting require the approval of the Court to be sought, pursuant to the Court’s discretion in
that section, provided the party has in good faith formed the view that the prospect of the
Court exercising its discretion in that way is reasonable.



     

    3.5
     
    Certain notices



     

    (a)
     
    If AWB or Agrium becomes aware that any condition precedent has been satisfied, it
must promptly notify the other in writing of this fact.



     

    (b)
     
    If, before the time specified for satisfaction of a condition precedent, an event that will
prevent that condition precedent being satisfied occurs, the party with knowledge of that
event must immediately give the other party written notice of that event.



     

    (c)
     
    AWB and Agrium (as the case may be) must promptly advise each other orally and in writing of
any change or event causing, or which, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, would cause:









     
    (1)
     
    a representation or warranty provided in this deed by a relevant party
to be false;



     

     
    (2)
     
    a breach or non-fulfilment of any of the conditions precedent; or



     

     
    (3)
     
    a material breach of this deed by a relevant party.

    AWB must propose a scheme of arrangement under which all of the Scheme Shares will be
transferred to Agrium or, where Agrium makes an election in accordance with clause 4.1(b),
Agrium Subsidiary and the Scheme Shareholders will be entitled to receive the Scheme
Consideration.



     

    (b)
     
    The parties agree that Agrium may elect under this clause 4.1(b) that a subsidiary of Agrium
will acquire the Scheme Shares under the Scheme by giving written notice to AWB of the
relevant subsidiary of Agrium which will acquire those Scheme Shares on or before the First
Court Date.



     

    4.2
     
    Scheme Consideration



     

    (a)
     
    Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Scheme Consideration is $1.50 cash per Scheme Share.



     

    (b)
     
    If AWB pays a dividend on or before the Implementation Date the Scheme Consideration per
Scheme Share will be $1.50 minus the cash amount of the dividend.



     

    4.3
     
    Agreement to fund a Permitted Dividend



     

    (a)
     
    Agrium agrees that, if AWB declares a Permitted Dividend (which for the avoidance of doubt
must only be payable by AWB if the Scheme becomes Effective), it will provide an unsecured,
interest free loan to AWB in a sum equal to the aggregate cash amount of the dividend payable
on each AWB Share.



     

    (b)
     
    The loan must:









     
    (1)
     
    be paid by Agrium to AWB at least one Business Day prior to the payment
date for the Permitted Dividend; and



     

     
    (2)
     
    not be repayable for at least one year following the payment date for
the Permitted Dividend.









    (c)
     
    Agrium’s obligation to make the payment referred to in paragraph (b)(1) above will be
satisfied by the payment of the relevant amount in immediately available funds to the account
nominated by AWB for the purposes of this clause.



     

    4.4
     
    Payment of Scheme Consideration



     

     
     
    Agrium undertakes and warrants to AWB (in its own right and separately as trustee or
nominee for each of the Scheme Shareholders) that, in consideration of the transfer to
Agrium (or, where an election is made under clause 4.1(b), Agrium Subsidiary) of each AWB
Share held by a Scheme Shareholder at the Scheme Record Date under the terms of the
Scheme, Agrium will on the Implementation Date:



     

    (a)
     
    accept or, where an election is made under clause 4.1(b), procure that Agrium Subsidiary
accepts that transfer; and

than as part of any annual salary review conducted in the ordinary course)
an employment contract with an existing employee of the AWB Group,

10 No-talk and no-shop obligations



10.1 No-talk

that none of its Representatives, Related Bodies Corporate and none of their
Representatives (including for the avoidance of doubt any Financial Advisors):



     

    (a)
     
    directly or indirectly participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations;



     

    (b)
     
    provide or make available any information (including by way of providing information and
access to perform due diligence);



     

    (c)
     
    enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding; or



     

    (d)
     
    communicate any intention to do any of these things,
in relation to, or which may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Transaction.





10.2 No-shop







     
     
    During the Restricted Period, AWB must not, and must ensure that none of its
Representatives, Related Bodies Corporate and none of their Representatives (including for
the avoidance of doubt any Financial Advisors):



     

    (a)
     
    solicit (including by way of providing information concerning AWB to any person), invite,

reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Transaction; or



     

    (b)
     
    communicate to any person an intention to do any of the things referred to in clause
10.2(a).





10.3 Limitation to No-talk







    (a)
     
    Nothing in clause 10.1 limits AWB’s ability to, and it is not a breach of clause 10.1 for,
AWB to provide the notification to GrainCorp Limited contemplated by clause 5.9(c)(2) of the
deed between AWB and GrainCorp dated 30 July 2010.



     

    (b)
     
    AWB, its Related Bodies Corporate and their Representatives may undertake any action that
would otherwise be prohibited by clause 10.1 in relation to a bona fide Competing Transaction
which was received after the date of this deed and which was not solicited by it and was not
otherwise brought about as a result of any breach by it of its obligations under this 
clause
10, where:









     
    (1)
     
    the Competing Transaction constitutes, or would be likely to
constitute, a Superior Proposal; and



     

     
    (2)
     
    the Board of AWB, acting in good faith and after having obtained written
advice from its legal advisers, determines, that not undertaking that act would be
likely to involve a breach of the fiduciary duties owed by any AWB director; or



     

     
    (3)
     
    it would otherwise be unlawful.

10.4 Notification of approaches







    (a)
     
    During the Restricted Period, AWB must notify Agrium in writing if it, or any of its
Related
Bodies Corporate or any of their Representatives becomes aware of any:









     
    (1)
     
    negotiations or discussions, approach or attempt to initiate any
negotiations or discussions, or intention to make such an approach or attempt to
initiate any negotiations or discussions in respect of any expression of interest,

the party making the expression of interest, offer or proposal, their terms and any
updates to the expression of interest, offer or proposal;



     

     
    (2)
     
    proposal whether written or otherwise made to AWB or any of its Related

    (3)
     
    provision by AWB, Related Bodies Corporate or Representatives of any

    action by AWB, or any intention of it to take any action, in reliance on
clause 10.3.









    (b)
     
    The obligations in this clause 10.4 do not apply to the extent that it requires AWB to
provide information the AWB Board has determined in good faith, and after having
obtained written advice from its legal advisers, that the consequences of providing the
relevant information would be likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties owed by
any AWB director.





10.5 Access to information







     
     
    AWB will not, and will procure that none of its Representatives, Related Bodies
Corporate and none of their Representatives (including for the avoidance of doubt any
Financial Adviser):



     

    (a)
     
    provide any information relating to AWB to any person in relation to a Competing Transaction,
unless that person has agreed to a standstill in respect of AWB on terms no more favourable
than the standstill Agrium has agreed to under the Confidentiality Deed (Third Party
Standstill); and



     

    (b)
     
    amend, waive or release a Third Party Standstill (or any part thereof) unless Agrium is first
offered an amendment, waiver or release from its standstill on the same terms.





10.6 Presentations







     
     
    Nothing in this clause 10 prevents AWB from continuing to make normal presentations
to brokers, portfolio investors and analysts in the ordinary course of business.

    11 Payment of costs






11 Payment of costs



11.1 Background







    (a)
     
    AWB and Agrium acknowledge that, if they enter into this deed and the Scheme is
subsequently not implemented, Agrium will incur significant costs.



     

    (b)
     
    In the circumstances referred to in clause 11.1(a), Agrium has requested that provision be
made for the payments outlined in clause 11.1, without which Agrium would not have entered
into this deed.



     

    (c)
     
    AWB confirms that the AWB Board has acknowledged that:









     
    (1)
     
    it has received legal advice in relation to this deed and the
operation of this clause 11;



     

     
    (2)
     
    it believes the implementation of the Scheme will provide significant
benefits to AWB and AWB Shareholders, such that it is reasonable and appropriate for
AWB to agree to the AWB Reimbursement Fee in order to secure Agrium’s participation
in the Transaction; and



     

     
    (3)
     
    the AWB Reimbursement Fee represents a genuine and reasonable estimate of
cost and loss that would be suffered by Agrium if this Deed was entered into and the
Scheme is subsequently not implemented (except in the case of a wilful breach by AWB
of any of clauses 5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.9 or 10, in which case, the AWB
Reimbursement Fee may represent an amount less than a genuine reasonable estimate of
that cost and loss).





11.2 Payment by AWB to Agrium







     
     
    If the pre-condition in clause 2.1 is satisfied and:



     

    (a)
     
    prior to the earlier of the Effective Date or the End Date, any member of the AWB Board
fails to recommend or withdraws or adversely modifies his or her support of the Scheme
or his or her recommendation that AWB Shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme or
the Constitutional Amendment Resolution, or makes a public statement indicating that
they no longer support the Scheme or the Constitutional Amendment Resolution or that
they support a Competing Transaction, other than:









     
    (1)
     
    as a result of the Independent Expert opining that the Scheme is not in
the best interests of Scheme Shareholders (other than where the reason for that
opinion is a Competing Transaction);



     

     
    (2)
     
    as a result of any matter or thing giving AWB the right to terminate
under clause 13.1(a)(1) or 13.1(a)(3); or



     

     
    (3)
     
    as a result of a failure of a condition precedent in clause 3.1
(except the conditions precedent in clause 3.1(f) or 3.1(g)), other than as a
result of a breach by AWB of clause 3.2;









    (b)
     
    a Competing Transaction is announced or made prior to the earlier of the Effective Date
or the End Date and, within 12 months after the date of this deed, a person other than
Agrium (or its associates) has or acquires voting power of 50% or more in AWB pursuant
to that transaction and the Competing Transaction is, or becomes, free from defeating
conditions;





Scheme Implementation Deed



page 25




 






    
    
    




     
     
     


    

     
    11 Payment of costs










    (c)
     
    at any time prior to the earlier of the Effective Date or the End Date, a person,
other than a member of the Agrium Group, acquires or agrees to acquire the whole or a
substantial part of AWB’s assets, business or property (whether by way of acquisition,
amalgamation, scheme of arrangement or otherwise); or



     

    (d)
     
    AWB is in material breach of any clause of this deed (including a material breach of a
AWB Representation and Warranty under clause 6) and Agrium terminates this deed pursuant
to clause 13.1(b)(2) as a result,

then AWB must pay Agrium the AWB Reimbursement Fee in accordance with clause 11.3.





11.3 Satisfaction of payment obligation







    (a)
     
    AWB must pay Agrium the amount claimed under clause 11.1 within 5 Business Days after
receipt by AWB of a demand for payment from Agrium unless a finding has been made by a court,
Takeovers Panel, regulatory authority or tribunal as described in clause 11.4, or an
application has been made to such a body seeking such a finding.



     

    (b)
     
    AWB’s obligation to make the payment referred to in clause 11.3(a) will be satisfied by the
payment of the relevant amount in immediately available funds to the account nominated by
Agrium for the purposes of this clause.





11.4 Nature of payment







     
     
    The amount payable by AWB under clause 11.1 is intended to be an amount to
compensate Agrium for:









     
    (a)
     
    advisory costs (including costs of advisors other than success fees);



     

     
    (b)
     
    costs of management and directors’ time;



     

     
    (c)
     
    out-of-pocket expenses; and



     

     
    (d)
     
    reasonable opportunity costs incurred by Agrium in pursuing the Scheme
or in not pursuing other alternative acquisitions or strategic initiatives which
Agrium could have developed to further its business and objectives,









     
     
    except in the case of a wilful breach by AWB of any of clauses 5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7,
5.9 or 10, in which case the amount payable by AWB under clause 11.1 may be less than a
sufficient amount to compensate Agrium for those costs and expenses.





11.5 Compliance with law







     
    (a)
     
    No amount shall be payable by AWB under clause 11.1 if the Scheme becomes
Effective, notwithstanding the occurrence of any event in clause 11.1. To the extent
that any amounts have already been paid under this clause 11.1 and the Scheme becomes
Effective, such amounts shall be immediately refunded to AWB.



     

     
    (b)
     
    This clause 11 does not impose an obligation on AWB to pay the AWB
Reimbursement Fee to the extent (and only to the extent) that the obligation to pay
the amount:









     
    (1)
     
    constitutes unacceptable circumstances as declared by the Takeovers
Panel; or

    12    Conduct of Court proceedings










     
    (2)
     
    is held to be unenforceable by one party against the other
as determined by a court,









     
     
     
    after all proper avenues of appeal and review, whether judicial or
otherwise, have been exhausted. The parties must take all reasonable
steps to ensure that any such determination applies to the minimum
extent possible.









     
    (c)
     
    The parties must not make or cause or permit to be made, any
application to a court or the Takeovers Panel for or in relation to a
determination referred to in clause 11.5(b).





11.6 Other claims







     
     
    Except in circumstances where AWB has wilfully breached any of clauses
5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.9 or 10 the maximum aggregate amount which AWB is
required to pay in relation to a breach of this deed by AWB is the AWB
Reimbursement Fee, and in no event will the aggregate liability of AWB under
or in connection with a breach of this deed exceed the AWB Reimbursement Fee.





12 Conduct of Court proceedings







    (a)
     
    AWB and Agrium are entitled to separate representation at all Court
proceedings affecting the Transaction.



     

    (b)
     
    This deed does not give AWB or Agrium any right or power to give
undertakings to the Court for or on behalf of the other party without that
party’s written consent.



     

    (c)
     
    AWB and Agrium must give all undertakings to the Court in all Court
proceedings which are reasonably required to obtain Court approval and
confirmation of the Transaction as contemplated by this deed.

    (2)
     
    if the pre-condition in clause 2.1(a) is satisfied, a
majority of the AWB Board subsequently changes or withdraws their
recommendation to AWB Shareholders to vote in favour of the Scheme, or

without breaching, clause 5.9; or



     

     
    (3)
     
    a Court or Government Agency has taken any action
permanently restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Transaction, or has
refused to do any thing necessary to permit the Transaction, and the
action or refusal has become final and cannot be appealed.









    (b)
     
    Without prejudice to any other rights of termination under this deed, Agrium may

    (A)
     
    that breach is material;



     

     
    (B)
     
    Agrium has given written notice to AWB setting

    the recommendation contemplated by clause 2.1(a) is not
given by the time referred to in clause 2.1(b);

recommends a Competing Transaction in each case whether in accordance
with clause 5.9 or not; or



     

     
    (5)

13.2 Effect of termination







     
     
    If this deed is terminated by either party under clauses 3.4(b) or 13.1
except to the extent that the termination results from a breach by either
party of its obligations under this deed, this deed will become void and
have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any
party, other than in relation to rights and obligations that accrued prior
to termination and other than in relation to the provisions of this clause
13 and of clauses 6.5 to 6.7 (representations and warranties), 9
(confidentiality), 11 (Payment of Costs) (other than where this deed is
terminated under clause 13.1(b)(3) in which case clause 11 does not remain
in force after termination), 14 (duty, costs and expenses), 15 (GST) and 16
(General), which will remain in force after termination.

    14    Duty, costs and expenses






13.3 Agrium acknowledgement







    (a)
     
    Agrium acknowledges and agrees that, if this deed is terminated by AWB
pursuant to clause 13.1(a)(1) due to a material breach by Agrium, Agrium’s
liability to AWB may not adequately reflect any loss or damage suffered by
AWB’s Shareholders (unlike the position that would apply if the Transaction was
to be implemented by takeover bid and section 670E of the Corporations Act
applied).



     

    (b)
     
    Accordingly, subject to clause 13.3(d), if AWB terminates this deed
due to a material breach by Agrium pursuant to clause 13.1(a)(1), any AWB
Shareholder who:









     
    (1)
     
    enters into a transaction relating to AWB Shares in reliance
on the announcement of Agrium’s proposal on 16 August 2010 or the announcement of the Transaction; and



     

     
    (2)
     
    suffers loss or damage as a result of the Transaction not
proceeding, may recover the amount of that loss or damage from Agrium.









    (c)
     
    AWB holds Agrium’s obligations under clause 13.3(b) as trustee or
nominee for each AWB Shareholder who is entitled to recover loss or damage
against Agrium under that clause.



     

    (d)
     
    Agrium is not liable for any such loss or damage if Agrium can show that
it could not reasonably have been expected to proceed with implementation of
the Scheme because:









     
    (1)
     
    at the time this deed was entered into, circumstances
existed affecting AWB which Agrium did not know of and could not
reasonably be expected to know of; or



     

     
    (2)
     
    after the date of this deed, a change in such circumstances
has occurred that was not caused, directly or indirectly, by Agrium.





13.4 Remedies







     
     
    The parties acknowledge that damages may not be a sufficient remedy for
breach of this deed. Specific performance, injunctive relief or any other
remedies which would otherwise be available in equity or law are available
as a remedy for a breach or threatened breach of this deed by any party,
notwithstanding the ability of any party to terminate this deed or seek
damages for such a breach or threatened breach or, in the case of Agrium,
to demand payment of the AWB Reimbursement Fee. This clause is not intended
to, and doesn’t, limit the operation of clause 11.6.





14 Duty, costs and expenses



14.1 Stamp duty







     
     
    Agrium must pay all stamp duties and any fines and penalties with
respect to stamp duty in respect of this deed or the Scheme or the steps to
be taken under this deed or the Scheme.





Scheme Implementation Deed

    15   GST






14.2 Costs and expenses







     
     
    Except as otherwise provided in this deed, each party must pay its own
costs and expenses in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and performance of this deed and the proposed, attempted or
actual implementation of this deed and the Transaction.





15 GST







    (a)
     
    Any consideration or amount payable under this deed, including any
non-monetary consideration (as reduced in accordance with clause 15(e) if
required) (Consideration) is exclusive of GST.



     

    (b)
     
    If GST is or becomes payable on a Supply made under or in connection
with this deed, an additional amount (Additional Amount) is payable by the
party providing consideration for the Supply (Recipient) equal to the amount of
GST payable on that Supply as calculated by the party making the Supply
(Supplier) in accordance with the GST Law.



     

    (c)
     
    The Additional Amount payable under clause 15(b) is payable at the same
time and in the same manner as the Consideration for the Supply, and the
Supplier must provide the Recipient with a Tax Invoice. However, the Additional
Amount is only payable on receipt of a valid Tax Invoice.



     

    (d)
     
    If for any reason (including the occurrence of an Adjustment Event) the
amount of GST payable on a Supply (taking into account any Decreasing or
Increasing Adjustments in relation to the Supply) varies from the Additional
Amount payable by the Recipient under clause 15(b):









     
    (1)
     
    the Supplier must provide a refund or credit to the
Recipient, or the Recipient must pay a further amount to the Supplier, as
appropriate;



     

     
    (2)
     
    the refund, credit or further amount (as the case may be)
will be calculated by the Supplier in accordance with the GST Law; and



     

     
    (3)
     
    the Supplier must notify the Recipient of the refund, credit
or further amount within 14 days after becoming aware of the variation to
the amount of GST payable. Any refund or credit must accompany such
notification or the Recipient must pay any further amount within 7 days
after receiving such notification, as appropriate. If there is an
Adjustment Event in relation to the Supply, the requirement for the
Supplier to notify the Recipient will be satisfied by the Supplier
issuing to the Recipient an Adjustment Note within 14 days after becoming

    is returned to AWB; or

order made by a court of competent jurisdiction:



     

    (a)
     
    which requires payment to a third party of a sum in respect of Scheme Shares held by a
particular Scheme Shareholder, which would otherwise be payable to that Scheme Shareholder in
accordance with clause 5.1(c), then AWB shall be entitled to procure that payment is made in
accordance with that order; or



     

    (b)
     
    which would prevent AWB from despatching a cheque to any particular Scheme Shareholder in
accordance with clause

Scheme of arrangement



page 8




 











    (a)
     
    in the case of dealings of the type to be effected using CHESS, the transferee is
registered in the AWB Share Register as the holder of the relevant AWB Shares on or before the
Scheme Record Date; and



     

    (b)
     
    in all other cases, registrable transfer or transmission applications in respect of those
dealings are received on or before the Scheme Record Date at the place where the AWB Share
Register is kept,



     

     
     
    and AWB will not accept for registration, nor recognise for the purpose of establishing the persons
who are Scheme Shareholders, any transfer or transmission application in respect of AWB Shares
received after such times, or received prior to such times but not in registrable form.



     

    6.2
     
    Register



     

    (a)
     
    AWB must register registrable transmission applications or transfers of the Scheme Shares
in accordance with clause 
6.1(b) on or before the Scheme Record Date; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 6.2(a) requires AWB to register a transfer that
would result in a AWB Shareholder holding a parcel of AWB Shares that is less than a
‘marketable parcel’ (as defined in the Market Rules of the ASX).



     

    (b)
     
    If the Scheme becomes Effective, a holder of Scheme Shares (and any person claiming through
that holder) must not dispose of or purport or agree to dispose of, any Scheme Shares or any
interest in them after the Scheme Record Date.



     

    (c)
     
    For the purpose of determining entitlements to the Scheme Consideration, AWB must maintain
the AWB Share Register in accordance with the provisions of this clause 6.2 until the Scheme
Consideration has been paid to the Scheme Shareholders. The AWB Share Register in this form
will solely determine entitlements to the Scheme Consideration.



     

    (d)
     
    All statements of holding for AWB Shares (other than statements of holding in favour of
Agrium) will cease to have effect after the Scheme Record Date as documents of title in
respect of those shares and, as from that date, each entry current at that date on the AWB
Share Register (other than entries on AWB Register in respect of Agrium) will cease to have
effect except as evidence of entitlement to the Scheme Consideration in respect of the AWB
Shares relating to that entry.



     

    (e)
     
    As soon as possible on or after the Scheme Record Date, and in any event within one Business
Day after the Scheme Record Date, AWB will ensure that details of the names, Registered
Addresses and holdings of AWB Shares for each Scheme Shareholder as shown in the AWB Register
are available to Agrium in the form Agrium reasonably requires.



     

    7
     
    Quotation of AWB Shares



     

    (a)
     
    AWB will apply to ASX to suspend trading on the ASX in AWB Shares with effect from the
close of trading on the Effective Date.



     

    (b)
     
    On a date after the Implementation Date to be determined by Agrium, AWB will apply:









     
    (1)
     
    for termination of the official quotation of AWB Shares on the ASX; and

liens, encumbrances, pledges, security interests and interests of third parties of any kind,
whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind, and that they have full

shareholders’ resolution whether in person, by proxy or by corporate representative;



     

    (b)
     
    undertakes not to otherwise attend or vote at any of those meetings or sign any shareholders’

    On the Scheme becoming Effective, each Scheme Shareholder, without the need for any further

    7 General










    (b)
     
    Agrium irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of courts exercising jurisdiction in Victoria and courts of appeal from them in respect of any
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this deed poll. Agrium
irrevocably waives any objection to the venue of any legal process in these
courts on the basis that the process has been brought in an inconvenient forum.



     

    7.3
     
    Waiver



     

     
     
    Agrium may not rely on the words or conduct of any Scheme Shareholder as
a waiver of any right unless the waiver is in writing and signed by the Scheme
Shareholder granting the waiver.



     

     
     
    The meanings of the terms used in this clause 7.3 are set out below.

which might otherwise give rise to an estoppel.










    7.4
     
    Variation



     

     
     
    A provision of this deed poll may not be varied unless the variation is
agreed to by AWB and the Court indicates that the variation would not of itself
preclude approval of the Scheme, in which event Agrium will enter into a further
deed poll in favour of the Scheme Shareholders giving effect to the variation.



     

    7.5
     
    Cumulative rights
