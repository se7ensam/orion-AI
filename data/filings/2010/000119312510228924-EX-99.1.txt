 On June 21, 2010 the Boards of Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7 Inc. announced that they had agreed to combine the two companies. In September,
unconditional clearance was granted by the US and Norwegian authorities.  Jean Cahuzac, Chief Executive Officer, said:
 “We have delivered a strong operational and financial performance in the third quarter further supporting our confidence in achieving
our 2010 revenue expectations. We now believe that the 2010 Adjusted EBITDA margin for continuing operations will be slightly ahead of the 2009 result. 
We expect further large projects will come to market award within the coming months and we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to costs, risk and
pricing, while building quality backlog and executing strongly.  As anticipated, we foresee a high level of activity for 2011 but we could see
some impact on our overall margins due to the delays in project awards over the last two years and the continuing competitive market prevailing in the North Sea. The proposed combination with Subsea 7 is on track, subject to shareholders approval
and other customary closing conditions.”  Financial Summary

 Financial Review 
Third quarter 2010  Revenue from
continuing operations for the third quarter was $495 million (Q3 2009: $558 million) primarily reflecting lower activity levels in the North Sea and Asia Pacific, as anticipated, partly offset by good activity levels in West Africa and Brazil.
 Gross profit was $126 million (Q3 2009: $116 million) reflecting strong project execution across the portfolio, partially offset by lower
activity levels and lower vessel utilisation.  Administrative expenses were $76 million (Q3 2009: $56 million) reflecting higher professional
fees arising from the proposed combination with Subsea 7, ongoing legal restructuring and organisational optimisation and higher tendering costs. 
Acergy’s share of results of associates and joint ventures was $38 million (Q3 2009: $17 million) reflecting a strong contribution from Seaway Heavy
Lifting (SHL), an improved positive contribution from SapuraAcergy, partially offset by a lower albeit positive contribution from NKT Flexibles. 
The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the three months was 24.9% (Q3 2009: 19.7%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations
for the three months was 26.0% (Q3 2009: 19.3%).  Other gains were $3 million (Q3 2009: $25 million) with the decrease from the third quarter
of 2009 primarily reflecting realised hedging losses arising from the weakened Euro and NOK.  Income before taxes from continuing operations
for the third quarter was $89 million (Q3 2009: $96 million) reflecting anticipated lower activity levels in the North Sea and Asia Pacific, partly offset by good operational performance and a good contribution from associates and joint ventures.
 Taxation for the quarter was $30 million (Q3 2009: $31 million) reflecting an effective tax rate for the quarter of 34% (Q3 2009: 32%) as a
result of the current geographical portfolio mix.  Income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $59 million (Q3 2009: $65
million). Net income from total operations for the third quarter was $64 million (Q3 2009: $67 million).  The cash and cash equivalents
position at the quarter end was $548 million (Q2 2010: $631 million). Deferred revenue, at the quarter end stood at $283 million (Q2 2010: $227 million). 
At quarter end, Acergy S.A. held directly 10,502,974 treasury shares representing 5.39% of the total number of issued shares, as well as holding
indirectly 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares, of which 583,000 are held in an employee benefit trust to support the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Total shares in issue were 194,953,972, including
treasury shares.  Operating Review 
Territory 1:  Acergy Northern
Europe and Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $165.8 million (Q3 2009: $216.6 million) reflecting the ongoing challenging market environment and fewer projects in installation phase, partly offset by
good operational progress on a number of projects including BP Skarv, Deep Panuke, which commenced offshore operations in the quarter, Gjoa Riser, DONG Trym and the DSVi frame agreement. Net operating income from continuing operations for the
quarter was $26.5 million (Q3 2009: $34.1 million), reflecting lower activity levels and ongoing margin pressure due to prevailing market conditions and the rescheduling of certain vessels for offshore operations, despite good vessel utilisation and
strong operational performance across the project portfolio in this segment. Commercial negotiations on the Marathon Volund Project continue. 
Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $4.7 million (Q3 2009: $43.2 million)
reflecting anticipated lower activity levels due to the completion of projects which were in their offshore phases in the prior period, partially offset by the close out of the Pluto Project. Net operating income from continuing operations was $19.9
million (Q3 2009: net operating loss of $0.1 million) due to the close-out of the Pluto Project and a strong contribution from the SapuraAcergy joint venture, reflecting good progress on the Gumusut Project and the completion of the Iwaki Project
during the quarter.

 Territory 2: 
Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $262.0 million (Q3 2009: $243.7 million)
reflecting good progress on a number of projects, including PazFlor, Block 17/18, EPC4A and Angola LNG and a strong contribution from Sonamet. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $43.1 million (Q3 2009: $27.2 million)
reflecting good project performance across the project portfolio, including PazFlor, which commenced offshore operations post quarter end, Block 17/18, EPC4A, and Sonamet. 
Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $10.9 million (Q3 2009:
$13.3 million) reflecting lower activity levels, partially offset by the contribution from the MEGI project, offshore Equatorial Guinea. Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.5 million (Q3 2009: net operating income of
$4.1 million) reflecting the lower activity levels and the completion of offshore operations on the cross-regional Frade Project and the Perdido Projects in the third quarter 2009, which was partially offset by good progress on the MEGI Project.
 Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $45.8 million (Q3 2009: $39.3
million) reflecting revenue from the ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras, including the Polar Queen, which commenced operations in 2010. Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $4.0 million (Q3 2009:
net operating income of $6.5 million) reflecting the dry-dock of the Acergy Condor and the completion of offshore operations on the cross-regional Frade Project during the third quarter of 2009, partially offset by good performance on the
Polar Queen, Pertinacia and Acergy Harrier.  Acergy Corporate: 
Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter was $5.8 million (Q3 2009: $2.2 million). Net operating income from continuing operations for the
quarter was $3.6 million (Q3 2009: $5.1 million) reflecting a strong contribution from SHL and a positive albeit lower contribution from NKT Flexibles, partially offset by professional fees arising from the proposed combination and ongoing legal
restructuring and organisational optimisation.  Discontinued operations: 
Net income from discontinued operations for the third quarter was $5.5 million (Q3 2009: $2.0 million) arising from the positive contribution from the
Mexilhao Trunkline Project.  Asset Development 
The Sonamet joint venture remained fully consolidated as at August 31, 2010 although it continues to be classified as ‘Assets held for
sale’. After the completion of the sale and transfer of shares the business will be deconsolidated from Acergy’s financials and its future results will be reported as share of results of associates and joint ventures. 
As part of the ongoing fleet development programme, Acergy has acquired two vessels during the third quarter. Firstly, the acquisition of the
Antares, a new shallow water barge for Conventional activity, including pipelay and hook-up projects in West Africa. Secondly, the acquisition of the Polar Queen, a flexible pipelay and subsea construction ship which joined the fleet
in 2006 on long-term charter, and which is currently on a long-term service agreement with Petrobras in Brazil.  Post quarter end, Acergy
acquired the Pertinacia, a flexible pipelay ship which joined the fleet in 2007 on long-term charter, and which is currently on a long-term service agreement with Petrobras in Brazil. 
Financing  On August 10, 2010
Acergy completed a new $1 billion revolving credit and guarantee facility. The purpose of the new facility is for general corporate purposes and operations of the Group, including the financing of vessels and the refinancing of the existing
facilities of the Group, namely the $400 million multicurrency revolving credit and guarantee facility agreement and the $200 million multicurrency guarantee facility agreement. The new facility will support Acergy’s ongoing operations and has
been entered into irrespective of the proposed Combination with Subsea 7.

 Backlog 
Backlog for continuing operations as at August 31, 2010 was approximately $3.5 billion, of which approximately $0.6 billion is expected to be
executed in the fiscal year 2010. This figure does not include backlog related to associates and joint ventures.

Trading Outlook  Confidence in the oil
price and strong tendering activity continues to underpin momentum in our business. However, for shorter-term work, particularly in the North Sea, the pricing environment remains competitive, and is likely to impact margins in 2011. 
Conventional activity in West Africa is expected to remain strong in the short and medium-term. A number of the major SURF contracts, delayed during
2009, are still expected to come to market award in the remainder of 2010 and the first half of 2011. However, the offshore installation phase of any such new SURF projects will commence beyond 2011. 
We believe the trend will be for SURF projects to continue to increase in size and complexity which will contribute to strong industry growth in the
medium-term. We are well placed to combine our competitive strengths of high calibre engineering and project management skills with our high quality assets to capture these growth opportunities. 
Proposed Combination of Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7 Inc. 
On June 21, 2010, the Board of Directors of both Acergy and Subsea 7 announced that their Boards of Directors have agreed to combine the two
companies subject to approval from shareholders and regulatory approvals and other customary completion conditions as outlined in the prospectus dated September 21, 2010. Completion is currently anticipated for January 2011. 
The proposed combination is based on an agreed ratio between the equity value of Acergy and Subsea 7. of 54:46 (Acergy:Subsea 7). Subsea 7’s
shareholders will receive 1.065 Acergy common shares for every Subsea 7 common share with the new entity, to be named Subsea 7 S.A.  The Board
will have a majority of independent directors and will be chaired by Subsea 7’s current Chairman, Kristian Siem. The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously agreed to recommend the combination to their respective shareholders.
 On September 22, 2010 Acergy published the notice of the Combination Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on November 9, 2010,
together with supporting materials, including the prospectus, dated September 21, 2010.  On September 28, 2010 Acergy announced that
anti-trust clearance for the proposed combination had been granted by the relevant US and Norwegian authorities.

 ACERGY S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. Basis of preparation  The condensed
consolidated financial statements for the period December 1, 2009 to August 31, 2010 have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with the annual financial statements
for the year ended November 30, 2009, as described in those annual financial statements.  2. Critical accounting judgements and key
sources of estimation uncertainty  In the application of the Group’s accounting polices which are described in the annual financial
statements for the year ended November 30, 2009, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
The Board of Directors make accounting judgements on the following aspects of the business as described in full in the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended November 30, 2009:   


 
•
 
 Revenue recognition on long-term contracts   


 
•
 
 Revenue recognition on variation orders and claims   


 
•
 
 Property, plant and equipment   


 
•
 
 Impairment of investments in and advances to associates and joint ventures 
 


 
•
 
 Recognition of provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities 
 


 
•
 
 Taxation   


 
•
 
 Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments

  For the three months ended August 31, 2010 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible note is to decrease the diluted
EPS from $0.272 to $0.265 (Q3 2009: anti-dilutive increase from $0.30 to $0.31). This is said to be dilutive and is therefore included in the calculation. 
For the nine months ended August 31, 2010 the effect of inclusion of the Convertible note would be to decrease the diluted EPS from $0.82 to $0.81
(YTD 2009: anti-dilutive increase from $0.92 to $0.93). This is said to be dilutive and is therefore included in the calculation.

 5. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
Acergy calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net
income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA margin
from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational
strength and the performance of our business.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions,
as they eliminate the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the
Acergy’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the Acergy may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to
EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the
SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this note, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Acergy’s
operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Acergy’s liquidity.  The
reconciliation of the Acergy’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this note. This note also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations
calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA
from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies
within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated using the methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.

  8. Contingent liabilities 
During 2009 Acergy’s Brazilian business was audited and formally assessed for ICMS tax (import duty) by the Brazilian tax authorities (Secretaria
Fazenda Estado Rio de Janeiro). The amount assessed including penalties and interest amounted to BRL133.9 million ($76.1 million) as at August 31, 2010. Acergy has challenged this assessment and will revert to the courts if necessary. No
provision has been made for any payment as Acergy does not believe that this liability is probable.  In the course of business, Acergy becomes
involved in contract disputes from time-to-time due to the nature of activities as a contracting business involved in several long-term projects at any given time. Acergy makes provisions to cover the expected risk of loss to the extent that
negative outcomes are probable and reliable estimates can be made. However, the final outcomes of these contract disputes are subject to uncertainties as to whether or not they develop into a formal legal action and therefore the resulting
liabilities may exceed the liability anticipated.  Furthermore, Acergy is involved in legal proceedings from time to time incidental to the
ordinary conduct of our business. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of any litigation could require Acergy to
make additional expenditures in excess of reserves that it may establish. In the ordinary course of business, various claims, suits and complaints have been filed against Acergy in addition to the ones specifically referred to above. Although the
final resolution of any such other matters could have a material effect on operating results for a particular reporting period, Acergy believes that they should not materially affect its consolidated financial position.
