<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-size: 11pt"><B>51job, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2010 Financial Results</B></FONT>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>SHANGHAI, China, May&nbsp;6, 2010 </B>&#150; <B>51job, Inc. (Nasdaq: JOBS)</B>, a leading provider of integrated human
resource services in China, announced today unaudited financial results for the first quarter of
2010 ended March&nbsp;31, 2010.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>First Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights:</B>
<BR>
&#150; Total revenues increased 42.6% over Q1 2009 to RMB254.3&nbsp;million (US$37.3&nbsp;million), exceeding the
Company&#146;s guidance range of RMB230&nbsp;million to RMB240&nbsp;million
<BR>
&#150; Gross margin expanded to 64.3% compared with 56.1% in Q1 2009
<BR>
&#150; Operating income increased to RMB61.1&nbsp;million (US$8.9&nbsp;million) compared with RMB11.7&nbsp;million in
Q1 2009
<BR>
&#150; Fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB0.91 (US$0.27 per ADS)
<BR>
&#150; Excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation loss,
non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB1.02 (US$0.30 per ADS), exceeding
the Company&#146;s guidance range of RMB0.68 to RMB0.78
<BR>
&#150; Cash and short-term investments increased to RMB1,274.2&nbsp;million (US$186.7&nbsp;million) as of March
31, 2010


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, Inc., said,
&#147;Despite a late Chinese New Year which fell in mid February, the high level of recruitment activity
in the post-holiday period drove better than expected revenues, which resulted in significant
margin expansion and profitability in the first quarter. We observed strong market demand as many
employers emerged from last year&#146;s challenging conditions with a renewed focus on growth and
aggressive hiring targets. During the quarter, we also continued to acquire customers for our
online business at a rapid pace. Led by this robust online segment and combined with a seasonal
rebound in our print business and steady development in our other HR services, our solid first
quarter results give us confidence for a successful 2010.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>First Quarter 2010 Unaudited Financial Results</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Total revenues for the first quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 were RMB254.3&nbsp;million (US$37.3&nbsp;million),
an increase of 42.6% from RMB178.3&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Print advertising revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased 30.9% to RMB92.4&nbsp;million
(US$13.5&nbsp;million) compared with RMB70.6&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009. The increase was
primarily due to higher average revenue per page as well as a greater volume of print advertising
pages. Although print advertising prices in each city remained relatively unchanged, overall
average revenue per page increased 22.3% over the first quarter of 2009 due to an increase in page
volume contribution from higher priced cities as compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
Despite the termination of print operations in the cities of Tianjin and Hefei in the first quarter
of this year, the estimated number of print advertising pages generated in the first quarter of
2010 increased 7.0% to 3,120 compared with 2,916 pages in the same quarter in 2009 resulting from
an improvement in market demand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Online recruitment services revenues for the first quarter of 2010 were RMB109.7&nbsp;million (US$16.1
million), representing a 60.8% increase from RMB68.2&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The increase primarily resulted from a greater number of unique employers using the
Company&#146;s online recruitment services, which was partially offset by lower average revenue per
unique employer. Unique employers increased 76.3% to 112,245 in the first quarter of 2010 compared
with 63,684 in the same quarter of the prior year driven by greater customer acceptance and usage
of online recruitment services. Average revenue per unique employer decreased 8.8% in the first
quarter of 2010 as compared to the same quarter in 2009 due to an increase in new customers who
generally purchased introductory or other lower priced products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Other human resource related revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased 32.3% to RMB52.2
million (US$7.6&nbsp;million) from RMB39.5&nbsp;million in the same quarter of 2009 primarily due to greater
market demand for our business process outsourcing, executive search and training services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Gross profit for the first quarter of 2010 increased 63.2% to RMB154.6&nbsp;million (US$22.6&nbsp;million)
from RMB94.7&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is equal to gross
profit divided by net revenues, expanded to 64.3% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 56.1%
in the same quarter in 2009 primarily due to greater economies of scale and improved efficiency.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were RMB93.5&nbsp;million (US$13.7&nbsp;million) compared
with RMB83.0&nbsp;million for the same quarter of 2009. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues decreased to 38.9% for the first quarter of 2010 compared with 49.2% for the first quarter
of 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2010 increased 13.1% to RMB56.2&nbsp;million
(US$8.2&nbsp;million) from RMB49.6&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to
higher advertising expenses and office expenses as compared to the same quarter in 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2010 increased 12.0% to RMB37.3
million (US$5.5&nbsp;million) from RMB33.3&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to higher
employee compensation expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Income from operations for the first quarter of 2010 increased to RMB61.1&nbsp;million (US$8.9&nbsp;million)
from RMB11.7&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. The reduction in the effective tax
rate to 22.8% in the first quarter of 2010 from 39.5% in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily
due to the qualification of an operating entity as a High and New Technology Enterprise in December
2009, which is subject to a preferential tax rate of 15%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Net income for the first quarter of 2010 increased to RMB50.4&nbsp;million (US$7.4&nbsp;million) from RMB9.4
million for the same quarter in 2009. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the first
quarter of 2010 were RMB0.91 (US$0.13) compared with RMB0.17 for the same quarter in 2009. Fully
diluted earnings per ADS for the first quarter of 2010 were RMB1.81 (US$0.27) compared with RMB0.34
in the first quarter of 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB6.4&nbsp;million (US$0.9&nbsp;million) compared with RMB7.6&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2009. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation loss of RMB68,000 (US$10,000) in the first
quarter of 2010 compared with a translation gain of RMB31,000 in the first quarter of 2009.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Business Outlook</B>

revenue target is in the estimated range of RMB250&nbsp;million to RMB260&nbsp;million (US$36.6&nbsp;million to

second quarter of 2010 is in the estimated range of RMB0.95 to RMB1.05 per common share (US$0.28 to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of income before
income tax expense, income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share and
adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of
share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss. The Company
believes excluding share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful
for its management and investors to assess and analyze the Company&#146;s core operating results as such
expense is not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company&#146;s business
operations and do not impact its cash earnings. The Company believes excluding foreign currency
translation gain or loss from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and
investors as such translation gain or loss is unrelated to the Company&#146;s core business operations
and will not result in cash settlement nor impact the Company&#146;s cash earnings. 51job also believes
these non-GAAP measures excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation
gain or loss are important in helping investors to understand the Company&#146;s current financial
performance and future prospects and to compare business trends among different reporting periods
on a consistent basis. The presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a
substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted
by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached
financial statements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Safe Harbor Statement</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Statements in this release regarding targets for the second quarter of 2010, future business and
operating results constitute &#147;forward-looking&#148; statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon management&#146;s current expectations, and actual
results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are
the number of recruitment advertisements placed, sales orders received and customer contracts
executed during the remaining weeks of the second quarter of 2010; any accounting adjustments that
may occur during the quarterly close; fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S.
dollar and other currencies; behavioral and operational changes of customers in meeting their human
resource needs as they respond to evolving social, economic and political changes in China as well
as stock market volatilities; introduction by its competitors of new or enhanced products or
services; price competition in the market for the various human resource services that the Company
provides in China; acceptance of new products and services developed or introduced by the Company
outside of the human resources industry and fluctuations in general economic conditions. For
additional information on these and other factors that may affect the Company&#146;s financial results,
please refer to the Company&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 51job
undertakes no obligation to update these targets prior to announcing final results for the second
quarter of 2010 or as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
