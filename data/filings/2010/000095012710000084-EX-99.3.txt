INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

 

 

Report on the annual accounts

Following our appointment by the General Meeting of the Shareholders dated 22 May 2009, we have audited the accompanying annual accounts of Acergy S.A., which comprise the balance sheet as at 30 November 2009, and the income statement, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

 

 

Board of Directors’ responsibility for the annual accounts

 

 

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these annual accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.  This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

 

 

Auditor’s responsibility

 

 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as adopted by the Institut des réviseurs d’entreprises.  Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the annual accounts are free from material misstatement.

 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual accounts.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

 

 

Opinion

 

 

In our opinion, the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position of Acergy S.A. as of 30 November 2009, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

 

 

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

 

 

The annual management report, which is the responsibility of the Board of Directors, is consistent with the annual accounts.

The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in the future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company except for:

 





  


●


Accounting for the loss in control of subsidiaries when the revised IAS 27 comes into effect.  When a parent ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the parent derecognises all assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest at their carrying amount.  Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is recognised at its fair value at the date control is lost.




 





  


●


Treatment of acquisition of subsidiaries when IFRS 3 Revised comes into effect for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after 1 December, 2009.




 

3.           Summary of significant accounting policies

 

The Company maintains its books and records in U. S. Dollars, and presents its annual accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the European Union.  The Company complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.  The transition date for adoption of IFRS was 1 December 2007 with adjustments of the comparative figures for the year starting 1 December 2006.

 

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for revaluation of certain financial instruments.

3.           Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

 

The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below:

 

3.1           Format of financial statements

 

In accordance with IAS 1 and Article 26 of the law of 19 December, 2002 as amended, the financial statements are presented with certain modifications to the general legal format requirements.  In the opinion of the Directors, this is necessary in order to present the financial position and results of the Company to the reader with the utmost clarity.

 

3.2           Revenue recognition

 

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.

 

Revenue relates to the provision of parent company guarantees administrated by an affiliated company Acergy Treasury Limited, based in England.

 

3.3           Investments

 

Investments are stated at cost less any impairment in value.  IAS1 and Article 51 (e) of the Law of 19 December, 2002 foresees that assets and liabilities are to be valued on an individual basis.  An annual impairment review is performed on an individual investment basis and any impairments of the cost would lead to value adjustments.  Dividend income from investments is recognized when shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established.

 

3.4           Translation of foreign currencies

 

The financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, which is the Company’s reporting currency.

 

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  All differences are taken to net income or loss.  Non monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.  Non monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.

 

3.5           Share based payments

 

Certain Directors of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share options.

 

Equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date on which they are granted.  The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes model.  The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘the vesting date’).

 

The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each balance sheet date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.  The cumulative expense also includes the estimated future charge to be borne by the employer entity in respect of social security or national insurance contributions, based on the intrinsic unrealised value of the stock option using the stock price on the balance sheet date.  The net income or loss charge or credit for a period represents the difference in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

3.           Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

 

3.5           Share based payments (continued)

 

Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of subsidiaries which are to be equity-settled, the Company records an increase in the cost of investment and a corresponding entry in equity of an amount equal to the expense recognised in the subsidiary.

 

3.6           Convertible loan notes

 

The component of the convertible notes issued by the Company that exhibits characteristics of a liability is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet, net of transaction costs.  On issuance of the convertible notes, the fair value of the liability component is determined using a market rate for an equivalent non convertible note; and this amount is classified as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until it is extinguished on conversion or redemption.

 

The fair value of the instrument, which is generally the net proceeds, less the fair value of the liability, is allocated to the conversion option which is recognised and included in shareholders’ equity, net of transaction costs.  The carrying amount of the conversion option is not remeasured.

 

Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible notes based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are first recognised.

 

3.7           Own shares

 

Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity at cost.  No gains or losses are recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.

 

3.8           Financial instruments

 

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

 

Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at ‘fair value through the profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held to maturity’ investments, ‘available for sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’.  The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.

 

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified as either FVTPL or ‘other financial liabilities’ according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities and is recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

 

3.9           Financial guarantee liabilities

 

Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor (generally an associate or joint venture of the Company), fails to fulfil a commitment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

 

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the guarantee.  Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date and the amount initially recognised.

12.           Convertible loan notes

 

On 11 October 2006 the Company issued a $500.0 million 2.25% convertible note due 2013.  The issuance was completed on 11 October 2006 with the receipt of net proceeds after deduction of issuance related costs of $490.8 million.  The issuance costs of $9.2 million have been split between the liability and equity components.

 

The convertible notes have an annual interest rate of 2.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on April 11 and October 11 of each year up to and including fiscal year 2013.  They were issued at 100% of their principal amount and unless previously redeemed, converted or cancelled will mature on October 11, 2013.  The convertible notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

 

The noteholders were granted an option which allows them to convert the convertible notes into common shares with an initial conversion price of $24.05 per share equivalent to 20,790,021 common shares, or approximately 10.7% of our issued share capital at the date of issue.  The conversion price was revised to $22.71 in 2009 (2008: $23.52) per share following the payment of the dividends since issuance, equivalent to 22,016,733 (2008: 21,258,503) common shares, or approximately 11.3% (2008:10.9%) of our issued share capital as of November 30, 2009.  The conversion price will continue to be adjusted in line with market practices for this type of instrument to provide ‘anti-dilutive’ adjustments for items such as payment of dividends and events such as a change of control which can affect materially the mark
etability, liquidity or volatility of common shares.

 

There is also an option for Acergy to call the convertible notes after October 25, 2010, if the price of the common shares exceeds 130% of the then prevailing conversion price during the above specified period.

12.           Convertible loan notes (continued)

 

The following is a summary of certain other terms and conditions that apply to our convertible notes:

 





  


●


the convertible notes are unsecured but contain a negative pledge provision which restricts encumbrances or security interests on current and future property or assets to ensure that the convertible notes will rank equally with other debt issuance;




 





  


●


a cross default provision subject to a minimum threshold of $10.0 million and other events of default in connection with non-payment of the convertible notes;




 





  


●


various undertakings in connection with the term of any further issuance of common shares, continuance of the listing of the shares and the convertible notes on recognised stock exchanges; and




 





  


●


provisions for the adjustment of the conversion price in certain circumstances.




 





  


There were no conversions of these convertible notes as of November 30, 2009.




 

The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible loan notes have been split between the liability element and an equity component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company, as follows:

 




 
  
 
 
$’000

Liability component at 30 November

 
 
415,606 
 
 
 
397,322 
 



 

The interest charged in the year is calculated by applying an effective rate of 7.35%.  The liability component is measured at amortised cost.  The difference between the carrying amount of the liability component at the date of issue and the amount reported in the balance sheet at 30 November 2009 represents the effective interest rate less interest paid to that date.

 

The Directors estimate the fair value of the liability component of the convertible loan notes at 30 November 2009 to be approximately $438.7 million (2008: $397.3 million).

On 11 September 2006 the commencement of a share buyback program was announced, which allowed for the purchase of up to a maximum of 10% of our issued share capital, pursuant to an extension to the standing authorisation granted to the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting held on 15 May 2006.

 

The share buyback program was completed during fiscal year 2008.  A total of 15.4 million shares for a total consideration of $301.6 million were repurchased.  These were open market repurchases on the Oslo Stock Exchange.  The buy back of issued share capital reduces the distributable reserves.

Paid in surplus

 

The directors propose that a dividend of $0.23 per share will be paid to shareholders in June 2010.  This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these consolidated financial statements.  The total estimated dividend to be paid is $42.1 million.

 


On 12 February 2009 a dividend of $0.22 per share (total dividend $40.2 million) was proposed for shareholders of record on 22 May 2009.

16.           Movements in reserves (continued)

 

Equity reserve

 

This reserve represents the equity component of the convertible loan notes. (Refer to Note 12 ‘Convertible loan notes’).

 

Legal reserve

 

Under Luxembourg law an amount equal to at least 5% of the annual income must be appropriated to a legal reserve until such reserve equals 10% of the issued share capital.  This reserve is not available for dividend distribution.  The legal reserve may also be satisfied by allocation of the required amount at the time of issuance of shares or by a transfer from share premium.

 

The legal reserve for all outstanding Common Shares has been satisfied and appropriate allocations are made to the legal reserve account at the time of issuance of new shares.

 

17.           Share based payments

 

Equity-settled share option plan

 

The Company operates a share option plan which was approved in April 2003 (the ‘2003 Plan’).  This plan includes an additional option plan for key directors and employees’ resident in France (the ‘French Plan’) as a sub-plan, and additional options which are granted under the Senior Management Incentive Plan (SMIP).

 

A Compensation Committee appointed by the Board of Directors administers these plans.  Options are awarded at the discretion of the Compensation Committee to directors and key employees.

 

Under the 2003 Plan options up to but not exceeding 6.3 million common shares can be granted.  Following shareholder approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 18 December 2008, the 2003 Plan was expanded to cover up to 8,710,000 shares.  This plan replaced the previous plan (the ‘1993 Plan’).  Any options granted under the French Plan count against this limit.  Other than options granted under the SMIP, options under the 2003 Plan (and therefore also under the French Plan) may be granted, exercisable for periods of up to ten years at an exercise price not less than the fair market value per share at the time the option is granted.  Such options vest 25% on the first anniversary of the grant date, with an additional 25% vesting on each subsequent anniversary. &
#160;The cost of these non-performance share options are therefore recognised using the graded vesting attribution method.  Share options exercises are satisfied by either issuing new shares or reissuing treasury shares.  Furthermore, options are generally forfeited if the option holder leaves the Company under any circumstances other than due to the option holder’s death, disability or retirement before his or her options are exercised.

 

In fiscal year 2009 no common share options were granted (2008: 1,052,000 common shares), and therefore no options were granted under the French Plan (2008: 234,000 options).

 

Senior Management Incentive Plan (“SMIP”)

 

As a condition to a bonding facility agreement which was finalised in 2004, there was a requirement to put in place a Key Staff Retention Plan (“KSRP”), now called the SMIP, in order to secure the services of certain senior executives.  The SMIP provided for deferred compensation as a combination of cash and performance-based share options, linked to the attainment of a number of strategic objectives for each of the fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006.  The objectives fixed in the plan, and agreed by the Board Compensation Committee, included targets for net profit, management team retention, bonding lines, internal controls over accounting and audit activities, business growth and restructuring.  During the fiscal year 2007 the Compensation Committee determined that 98.3% of the objectives had bee
n met and therefore the performance-based share options vested on February 28, 2007 and the cash compensation was paid.  No compensation was awarded for fiscal year 2008 and no further awards will be made under this plan.  The options under the SMIP are exercisable until ten years after their date of grant.

Restricted share plan

 

In March 2008 the Board of Directors approved and adopted a restricted share plan to provide a retention incentive to selected senior executives.  The plan stipulates that the number of free (without any cash compensation) shares that may be awarded under the plan may not exceed an average of 350.000 common shares over a three year period.  During the three year restricted plan period, participants are not permitted to sell or transfer shares but will be entitled to dividends which will be held by the Company until the restricted period lapses during fiscal year 2011.  In April 2008, 65,000 restricted shares were issued to selected senior executives as part of the retention incentive of the plan.  These shares had a fair value representing their weighted average market price of $22.23, being the ma
rket price on the date of issue.  No further restricted shares have been issued under the Restricted Share Plan.

 

2008 Executive Deferred Incentive Scheme

 

During the fiscal 2008 year the Board of Directors approved and adopted a deferred incentive scheme for selected senior executives including stipulating the number of shares that may be awarded.  The scheme enables the executives to defer, on a voluntary basis, up to 50% of their annual bonus into shares of Acergy S.A. which will be matched in shares at the end of three years subject to performance conditions.  The value of the bonus deferred was used to purchase 17,797 shares based upon the prevailing share price on March 31, 2008 which was $21.35.  The matched element is conditional upon the growth of earnings per share over the three years to November 30, 2010.

 

2009 Executive Deferred Incentive Scheme

 

During the fiscal 2009 year the Board of Directors approved and adopted a deferred incentive scheme for selected senior executives.  The scheme enables the executives to defer, on a voluntary basis, up to 50% of their annual bonus into shares of Acergy S.A. which will be matched in cash at the end of three years subject to performance conditions.  The value of the bonus deferred was used to purchase 58,374 shares based upon the prevailing share price on April 17, 2009 which was $7.64.  The matched element is conditional upon achieving target total shareholder return over the three years to March, 2012 and is conditional on the shares being held for three years.

The expected life of an option is determined by taking into consideration the vesting period of options, the observed historical pattern of share option exercises, the effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.  The expected volatility over the expected term of the options is estimated from our historical volatility.  For fiscal year 2008 the expected dividend takes into account the expected dividends over the four year vesting period assuming a growth rate of 5% over the $0.21 cent dividend declared during the year.

18.           Commitments and guarantees

 

We arrange for bank guarantees, which collectively refer to bank guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds, advance payment bonds, guarantees or standby letters of credit in respect of our performance obligation to be provided to our clients in connection with our work on specific projects.

 

Facilities

 

The following facilities, held by affiliated undertakings, were guaranteed by the Company as at 30 November 2009:

 

The $400 million credit and guarantee facility, dated August 10, 2006 comprises $300 million available for the issuance of guarantees (2008: $300million) and $75 million available for cash drawings, a reduction from fiscal year 2008 ($100 million) and will further reduce to $50 million until the final date of maturity of August 10, 2011.  To the extent that no loans are drawn under the amount available for cash, this part of the facility can be utilised for guarantee issuance.  Additionally the maturity date of the guarantees must be prior to February 10, 2013.  As at November 30, 2009 under the $400 million facility, the Company had fully utilised the $300 million available for guarantee issuance (2008: $207.3 million) and had used $68.9 million of the $75 million facility for guarantee issuance (2008: $nil
).  No drawdowns of cash under this facility were made in the fiscal year 2009.  This facility is guaranteed by a Company guarantee only.

 

The $400 million facility also contains events of default which include payment defaults (subject to a three day grace period), breach of financial covenants, breach of other obligations, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, illegality, unenforceability, conditions subsequent, curtailment of business, claims against an obligor’s assets, appropriation of an obligor’s assets, final judgements, cross-defaults to other indebtedness in excess of $5.0 million, failure to maintain exchange listing, material adverse effect, auditor’s qualification, repudiation and material litigation.

 

Interest on the $400 million facility is payable at LIBOR plus a margin which is linked to the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and which may range from 0.8% to 1.9% per year.  The margin is currently fixed at 0.8% for a period of three months from November 30, 2009.  The fee applicable for performance guarantees is linked to the same ratio of net debt to EBITDA and may range from 0.4% to 0.95% per year and is currently fixed at 0.4%.  Both of these rates are subject to a quarterly review.

 

The $400 million facility shares certain terms and conditions with the $200 million facility, as described below.

18.           Commitments and guarantees (continued)

 

The $200 million guarantee facility

 

On February 26, 2008, the Company executed a $200 million multi-currency revolving guarantee facility with a number of banks from the existing consortium that provided the $400 million facility.  The $200 million facility is secured by a guarantee from the Company.

 

The $200 million facility is to be used for the issuance of performance guarantees to Acergy Group companies.  The facility has a maturity date of February 26, 2013, however, performance guarantees can be issued with a maturity no later than August 26, 2014.

 

The fee applicable for performance guarantees is linked to the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and may range from 0.45% to 1.00% per year and is currently fixed at 0.45%.  This is subject to a quarterly review.

 

Both the $400 million and $200 million facilities contain financial covenants in respect of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum level of net debt to EBITDA, a maximum level of total financial debt to tangible net worth, a minimum level of cash and an interest cover covenant.  The requirements of the financial covenants must be met on a consolidated basis at quarterly intervals ending February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year.  In addition to the financial covenants listed above, both facilities contain negative pledges with respect to accounts receivable and cash and include representations, affirmative covenants and negative covenants and events of defaults which are customary for facilities of this nature and consistent with past practice.  Such covenants specifically limit m
ergers or transfers, incurrence of other indebtedness, investments and loans and distributions to shareholders.

 

The NOK 977.5 million Loan and Guarantee Facility (the “NOK 977.5 million facilities”)

 

Acergy Havila Limited is a 50/50 joint venture between Acergy Bermuda Ltd. (wholly owned by Acergy S.A.) and Havila Shipping Pte Ltd. (wholly owned by Havila Shipping ASA).  On October 14, 2008 the company completed a loan facility for post-delivery financing of up to Norwegian krone 977.5 million ($173.5 million) for the purchase of a dive support vessel to be owned by the joint venture, when it is delivered in 2010.  The final termination date of the facility is no later than April 30, 2020.

 

The NOK 977.5 million facility contains the financial covenant that Current Assets exceed Current Liabilities.  This requirement must be met at quarterly intervals ending February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year.  The facility also contains vessel covenants customary to a facility of this nature.

 

In addition to the above covenants, the facility also contains events of default which include payment defaults (subject to a three day grace period), breach of the financial covenant, breach of other obligations, breach of representations, insolvency, illegality, repudiation, material adverse effect, cross-defaults to other indebtedness in excess of $2.5 million for Acergy Havila Limited and in excess of $5.0 million for Acergy and failure by Acergy to maintain exchange listing.  The facility also contains negative pledges with respect to accounts receivable and cash.

 

Security on the facility is provided by a first priority mortgage on the vessel.  A charter guarantee has been provided by the Company.  In the event of an event of default occurring this turns into a several guarantee to be shared 50/50 by the Company and Havila Shipping ASA.

 


The facility’s commitment fee is set at a rate of 0.40%.  Upon delivery of the vessel loan interest will be payable at NIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% per year for the first five years and 1.10% for the subsequent five years.

20.           Tax

 

The Company has elected to be taxed as a billionaire holding company and is subject to a variable tax rate, calculated annually with half-yearly advance payments, which is based on certain interest expense, dividends and certain compensation paid to non-resident directors during the period.  The tax is calculated as follows:

 

Where the total interest paid each year to bondholders and on other comparable securities amounts to or exceeds €2,400,000:

 





  


●


3% on interests paid to bond and other security-holders;




 





  


●


1.8% on dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to non-resident directors on the first €1,200,000;




 





  


●


0.1% on any surplus dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to non-resident directors.

Where the total interest paid each year to bondholders and on other comparable securities is less than €2,400.000:

 





  


●


3% on interests paid to bond and other security-holders;




 





  


●


3% on dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to non-resident directors, but to a maximum amount corresponding to the difference between €2,400,000 and the total interest paid to bondholders and on other comparable negotiable securities;




 





  


●


1.8% on any surplus dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to non-resident directors up to €1,200,000 distributed;




 





  


●


0.1% on surplus dividends, profit quotas and remuneration to non-resident directors.




 

Billionaire holding companies are subject to a minimum annual charge of €48,000.  The tax election made cannot be reversed; in other words, billionaire holding companies cannot elect different tax treatment from one year to the next.

 

For the years ended 30 November 2009 and 2008 this tax amounted to $447,000 and $351,000 respectively, and is included in other charges in the accompanying statements of profit and loss.

 

As per Note 1 the Company must remain within the limits set out by the Law of 31 July 1929 governing holding companies which fiscal regime is maintained for a transitional period until 31 December 2010 according to conditions defined by the Law of 22 December 2006 amending the Law of 31 July 1929.

22.    Financial instruments

 

Significant accounting policies

 

Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 3 ‘Significant accounting policies’.

 

Financial risk management objectives

 

An affiliated group treasury company, provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Company through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.  These risks include market risk (consisting of currency risk and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

 

The treasury company seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.  The use of financial instruments is governed by the Company’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written policies on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.

 

Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis and the treasury company function reports monthly to senior management.  The Company does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes.

 

Market risk

 

The Company has limited exposure to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see below) but has exposure to the financial risks of changes in interest rates (see below).

 

There has been no change to the Company’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.

 

Foreign currency risk management

 

The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and undertakes the majority of its transactions in the US dollar.  The Company therefore has minimal exposure to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

 

Interest rate risk management

 

The Company places surplus funds on the money markets to generate an investment return for short durations only, ensuring a high level of liquidity and reducing the credit risk associated with the deposits.  Changes in the interest rates associated with these deposits will impact the return generated.

 

The Company’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section (see below).

22.           Financial instruments (continued)

 

Credit risk management

 

Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company.  The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

 

The Company only invests with entities that are rated the equivalent of investment grade and above.  This information is supplied by independent rating agencies.  The Company’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.  Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the risk management committee annually.  In respect of its clients and suppliers the Company uses credit ratings as well as other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major counterparties.

 

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

 

The table below shows the carrying amount of our major counterparties (depositors) at the balance sheet date using the Standard and Poor’s credit rating symbols.

Liquidity risk management

 

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.  The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

 

Liquidity and interest risk tables

 

The following tables detail the Company’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.

Fair value of financial instruments

 

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

 





  


●


the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices;




 





  


●


the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments;




 





  


●


the fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices.  Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives;




 





  


●


the fair value of financial guarantee contracts is determined using option pricing models where the main assumptions are the probability of default by the specified counterparty extrapolated from market-based credit information and the amount of loss, given the default.
