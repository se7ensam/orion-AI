<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The calculation of barrels of oil equivalent (&#147;boe&#148;) are based on a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet (&#147;mcf&#148;) of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil. Boe&#146;s may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl is base on energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</P>
