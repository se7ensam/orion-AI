  <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>CALGARY, ALBERTA - Alberta Star Development Corp. (TSXV:ASX) (&#147;Alberta Star&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) </B>announces that it has completed the second of the five (5) standing cased wells that had been previously drilled but not completed by a former operator in late 2009. The Company acquired a 33 1/3 % net interest in the five (5) standing cased heavy oil wells interest from its working interest partner and operator, Western Plains Petroleum Ltd. (&#147;Western Plains&#148;) in late August 2010. The second completed well, located on 06-24-50-2 W4M in Lloydminster, Alberta is expected to have production similar to the first completed well situated on 10-06-50-1 W4M which is currently producing at approximately 40 bbls/day of heavy oil (13 bbls/day net to Alberta Star) from the Sparky oil formation. Combined production from both wells is expected to be 80 bbls/day of heavy oil (26 bbls/day net to Alberta Star). Completion of the third well is scheduled for next 
week, with the fourth standing cased well to be completed by early October. The production rates from each completed well is expected to be approximately 40 bbls/day (13 bbls/day net to Alberta Star) for a total estimated production from all completed wells to be approximately 160 bbls/day (53 bbls/day net to Alberta Star).</P>
  <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B><U>PROGRESS UPDATE- IN-FILL DRILLING</U></B></P>
  <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In addition to the pending completion of the five cased wells, the Company expects to drill and complete an additional four (4) in-fill wells on section 6-50-25-W3M in Landrose, Saskatchewan by the end of October. The Company is expecting to spud its first well by this weekend on C11-06-50-25 W3M (50% net interest to Alberta Star). This drill location will be offsetting the Company&#146;s producing well located at C-12-06-50-25-W3M. The C-12 well is currently producing approximately 80bbls/d gross of heavy oil (4 bbls/s day net BPO and 20 bbls net APO to the Company).</P>
  <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Drilling completion and equipping costs are expected to average $400,000 per well ($200,000 net to Alberta Star). Alberta Star holds a 50% working interest in these assets and Western Plains is the operator. The locations of the four (4) in-fill wells are adjacent to the Company&#146;s successful C12-06-50-25 W3M well which was drilled and completed in July 2010 in accordance with a farm-out with Arctic Hunter Uranium Inc.</P>

A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl is base on energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</P>
