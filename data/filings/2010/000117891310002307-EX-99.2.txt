B Communications Ltd.

 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel in 1999 as “Gold E Ltd.”  In 2000, we changed our name to Goldtrade Electronic Trading Ltd., and in 2006, we changed our name to Smile.Communications Ltd.  In 2007, we changed our name to 012 Smile.Communications Ltd. following our acquisition of 012 Golden Lines Ltd.  In October 2007, we completed our initial public offering in the United States, prior to which we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Internet Gold, a public company traded on the NASDAQ Global Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, or the TASE, whose shares are included in the TASE-75 Index.  On March 16, 2010, we changed our name to B Communications Ltd. in connection with our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq.

 

Since April 14, 2010, we have been the controlling shareholder of Bezeq (TASE:BZEQ), Israel’s largest telecommunications provider.

 

Bezeq is the principal provider of communications services in Israel.  Bezeq and its subsidiaries implement and provide a broad range of telecommunications operations and services, including domestic fixed-line, cellular, Internet services, international communication services, multi-channel television, satellite broadcasts, customer call centers, maintenance and development of communications infrastructures, provision of communications services to other communications providers, television and radio broadcasts, and supply and maintenance of equipment on customer premises (such as network endpoint services).  Bezeq has the following four principal areas of operation, which are reported as business segments in its consolidated financial statements:

Recent Developments

 

On August 2, 2010, Bezeq’s board of directors recommended the distribution of a cash dividend to its shareholders of an aggregate NIS 1.28 billion, or approximately NIS 0.48 per share.  The dividend, which is subject to shareholder approval, would be payable on October 7, 2010 to shareholders of record as of September 20, 2010.  The recommendation is in accordance with Bezeq’s dividend policy of distributing, on a semi-annual basis, cash dividends amounting to 100% of the net profit attributable to shareholders.  We currently hold 30.41% of Bezeq’ outstanding shares.

Risk Factors




 

An investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk.  Therefore, you should not invest in our securities unless you are able to bear a loss of your entire investment.  You should carefully consider the following factors as well as the other information contained in this prospectus and in the other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and that we incorporate by reference into this prospectus before deciding to invest in our securities.  This prospectus and statements that we may make from time to time may contain forward-looking information.  There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations, statements or projections.  Factors that could cause actual res
ults to differ from our expectations, statements or projections include the risks and uncertainties relating to our business described below.  The information in this prospectus is complete and accurate as of the date of this prospectus, but the information may change thereafter.

 

Risks Related to the Business of Bezeq

 

Bezeq’s competition from other telecommunications providers, and potential changes in the competitive environment and communications technologies, could adversely affect its business and our results of operations.

 

Competition in domestic landline services in Israel is intensifying. Furthermore, we view the cellular telephony market as a market which, to a large extent, is an alternative to the fixed-line domestic telephony market. The companies that currently compete with Bezeq or that are likely to compete with it in the future enjoy much greater business flexibility than Bezeq, including an ability to cooperate with subsidiaries and associates and to market joint service bundles with them. The ability of Bezeq’s competitor HOT Telecom, or HOT, a partnership of the cable companies, to market service bundles (broadband Internet, telephony and cable television) with tariff flexibility, compared with the current restrictions on our ability to do so, harms Bezeq’s ability to compete.

 

On July 15, 2010, the Israeli Government resolved to take measures in order to allow the Israeli Electric Company to operate in the telecommunications field, and establish a new telecommunications company, which would use the electricity grid for telecommunications infrastructure.  If such measures are adopted and implemented, the use of the electricity grid as infrastructure for telecommunications could adversely affect Bezeq’s position as a telecommunications infrastructure provider.

 

In addition, the cellular market in Israel is highly saturated and characterized by strong competition, and is subject to technological and regulatory developments. Bezeq’s operations in the cellular market, through its subsidiary, Pelephone, face fierce competition from the other cellular operators, Partner Communications Company Ltd. (a company controlled by Scailex Corporation Ltd.), or Partner, Cellcom Israel Ltd., a subsidiary of the IDB group, or Cellcom, and MIRS Communications Ltd., or MIRS, which has increased the size of the market and subscribers, but has caused an erosion of prices. There is a trend to legislate and impose standards on cellular operations relating to the environment, increased competition, tariffs, product liability and the methods used for repairing products, which regulations could make it harder
 to construct cellular sites, impairing network quality, and increase the costs of services and marketing. Due to the intense competition in the cellular market, we may not be able to roll those costs in full onto consumers, which could erode our profits in the sector. Furthermore, regulatory intervention and the uncertainty it entails may have an adverse effect on our ability to plan our cellular business activity.

 



  



C - 7







  



 

The competition in the cellular and land-line markets has increased as a result of the introduction of number portability and we expect it to further increase upon implementation of the Ministry of Communications’ policy to encourage the entry of mobile virtual network operators into the cellular market.

 

Additionally, in the field of television broadcasts, in which Bezeq operates through DBS, which is characterized by a very high penetration rate and very strong competition, Bezeq is required to constantly invest in recruiting and retaining customers; and dealing with high transfer rates of customers between DBS and HOT and abandonment by costumers who view broadcast via the Internet and digital terrestrial television. The offer of a bundle of services containing multi-channel television, Internet and telephony, which are not offered in this format by DBS, as well as HOT’s high penetration rates for video on demand, or VOD, services also increase HOT’s ability to compete against DBS. DBS’s inability to offer VOD services in competition with HOT also harms DBS’s ability to compete.

 

Telecommunications is a field characterized by frequent technological changes and a short economic life span for new technologies. These trends mean a constant lowering of entry barriers for new competitors, an increase in depreciation rates, and in certain cases, redundancy of technology and networks owned, which may cause Bezeq to incur impairment charges for investments which are still recorded on its statements of financial position.

 

Competition in the voice, cellular and Internet services markets in Israel is intensifying. The main characteristic of market competition in 2009 was the merging of communication groups and offering of comprehensive services and products. Four main groups operate in the communications market in Israel today: the Bezeq group, the IDB group, the Partner group and the HOT group. There are four competitors in the international long distance voice services market in Israel, Bezeq International, 013 NetVision Ltd. (a member of the IDB group), or 013 NetVision, 012 Smile Telecom Ltd., or 012 Smile Telecom, and Xfone Ltd., or Xfone. In the ISP market there are a number of competitors, including Bezeq International, 012 Smile Telecom, 013 NetVision and Partner, and two minor niche players, and Bezeq believes that HOT is preparing to enter th
is market. In the cellular services market in Israel there are four competing companies: Cellcom, Partner, Pelephone and MIRS. Pelephone faces fierce competition from such other cellular operators and such competition has resulted in an increase in the size of the market, the addition of new subscribers and an erosion of prices.

 

On July 15, 2010, the Israeli Government resolved to amend the Israeli Communications Law (Telecommunications and Broadcasting), 1982, or the Communications Law, to require mobile operators that own infrastructure to allow a new mobile provider to roam within Israel on their network for a period of up to ten years or until such new operator maintains a full independent network.  This resolution is subject to legislation, and, if approved and implemented, could have an adverse affect on Bezeq’s business.

 

Bezeq operates in a highly regulated telecommunications market which limits its flexibility in managing its business and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

 

Bezeq operates in a highly regulated industry in Israel, which limits its flexibility in managing its business, mainly with respect to the land-line market. Bezeq is subject to government supervision and regulation relating to, among other things, licensing for activity, determining permitted areas of activity, determining tariffs, operation, competition, environment, payment of royalties, obligation to provide universal service, ability to hold its shares, relationships between Bezeq and its subsidiaries and prohibition to terminate or restrict its services (which may force Bezeq to provide services even when not economically feasible or against its interests). This supervision and regulation at times lead to the intervention of the State of Israel. Bezeq’s business and operations could be adversely affected by decisions by r
egulators, in particular the Ministry of Communications as well as changes in laws, regulations or government policy affecting its business activities. Further risks and uncertainties result from the fact that changes in such laws, regulations or government policies may not be adopted or implemented in the manner that Bezeq expects and may be further amended, interpreted or enforced in an unexpected manner or in a manner adverse to Bezeq’s business and results of operations.

On July 15, 2010, the Israeli Government has resolved to take certain measures relating to the regulation of the communications market including, among other things, to promote the usage of the electricity grid of the Israeli Electric Company as telecommunications infrastructure; to obligate mobile operators to enable a new mobile provider to use their network for national roaming; to amend the manner in which the termination fees are calculated in the mobile market; and to establish a committee to examine ways for network sites sharing between different mobile operators; to raise royalties paid by communications operators from 1% to 2% in 2011 and 2.5% in 2012 and 2013. Some of these reforms and measures are subject to legislation and their implementation may have an adverse affect on Bezeq's business.

 

Bezeq may face difficulties in obtaining some of the building and environmental permits required for the establishment and operation of its network sites, which could have an adverse effect on the coverage, quality and capacity of its network.

 

Bezeq, mainly with respect to its cellular operations through Pelephone, is subject to the Israeli Non-Ionizing Radiation Law, 5766-2006, which regulates the emission of electromagnetic radiation from broadcast facilities. Bezeq is currently working to obtain permits to set up and operate its various broadcasting installations; however, the policies maintained by the various relevant entities and amendments to applicable statutes and standards could adversely impact the infrastructure of such installations and the regularity of the services using the infrastructure. As a result, Bezeq’s revenues from these services could be adversely affected.

 

In addition, the establishment and operation of cellular antennas are subject to building permits from various planning and building committees, a process that involves a number of approvals from Israeli state and local entities and regulatory bodies.

 

The foregoing may impair the quality and capacity of Bezeq’s existing network and the deployment of the new network.

 

Actual and alleged health risks related to cellular network sites and mobile telecommunication devices could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.

 

Cellular network sites, handsets and accessories are known to be sources of non-ionizing radiation emissions. Bezeq takes steps to ensure that the levels of radiation emitted by these transmission facilities, equipment and devices do not exceed the levels of radiation permitted in the directives of the Israeli Ministry of Environment Protection (levels adopted in accordance with international standards). However, health risks may be found to exist and transmission sites or devices and equipment may emit more radiation than that allowed in radiation standards, causing a risk to health, which may have an adverse effect on our business and could result in a reduction in the use of cellular services, difficulty in renting sites, claims for physical and property damages in substantial amounts and attempts to exercise the deeds of indemni
ty that Bezeq deposited with the planning authorities pursuant to the Planning and Building Law. Bezeq’s third-party liability policy does not currently cover electromagnetic radiation.

Bezeq’s tariffs for its services are subject to government control, which harms its ability to compete and results in an erosion of its tariffs, which adversely affects its business.

 

Bezeq’s tariffs for its services are subject to government control. Some of these tariffs are stipulated in regulations and regulations also stipulate a formula for updating tariffs. Bezeq is restricted in its ability to give discounts on its principal services and to offer differential tariffs. Further, alternative service packages, which should provide an immediate alternative to the regular tariffs, are currently subject to an extended approval process, which often renders the alternative service package option moot. The foregoing factors harm Bezeq’s ability to compete and results in an erosion of its tariffs, which adversely impacts its business.

 

On February 14, 2010, the Ministries of Communications and Finance announced the appointment of a committee that will consider a new tariff arrangement for Bezeq, including determining new tariffs relating to the provision of services in the wholesale market for fixed-line communications (including resale and the provision of access to infrastructure) and call completion tariffs in the fixed-line networks. In accordance with the committee’s appointment terms, any arrangement for regulated tariffs must also include a mechanism for updating the regulated tariffs. On May 4, 2010, Pelephone received notice from the Minister of Communications that he is considering reducing mobile fees for call completion and text messages completion commencing August 1, 2010, with a further gradual reduction in such rates. On June 24, 2010 Pelepho
ne filed its response to this proposal. The foregoing measures may result in erosion in revenue, which would adversely affect Bezeq’s business.

 

Bezeq is subject to restrictions on intercompany relations with affiliated companies, which harms its ability to compete and adversely affects its business.

 

Bezeq’s general license for fixed-line communication services received from the Minister of Communications obligates it to ensure that its relationships with its principal subsidiaries do not result in favoring them over their competitors. Separation is required between the managements of Bezeq and such other companies, as is separation between the financial and marketing systems, assets and employees, which causes high administration overheads. Bezeq is also subject to limitations with respect to the offering of joint service bundles with those companies, which adversely impacts its business, particularly in light of the recent entry into the market of communications companies competing directly with Bezeq in most of its areas of operation based on the provision of bundled services to the customer.

 

Bezeq’s systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption, which could expose it to material risk of loss or litigation.

 

Bezeq’s systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, communications failures, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of Internet vandalism and similar events. Any of these events could expose Bezeq to a material risk of loss or litigation. While Bezeq currently has partially redundant systems, its does not have full redundancy, or alternative providers of hosting services.

 

Bezeq is currently deploying its new generation network, which to a large extent will replace its traditional networks. The set-up of a new network based on advanced technology involves operational and business risks, such as damaging the continuity and quality of the services provided to Bezeq’s customers, which could adversely impact its business.

 



  



C - 10







  



 

Bezeq’s operations in the cellular market are exposed to losses in the event of malfunctions in the terminal equipment that it sells, including various property risks and liabilities. Bezeq’s cellular information systems are networked throughout the country through designated communications lines and via the Internet, and its cellular business is highly dependent upon these systems. Wide-scale malicious harm or malfunction might adversely affect Bezeq’s cellular business and financial results. Also, Bezeq’s cellular communications network is deployed around the country through network core sites and antenna sites and it cellular business is totally dependent upon these systems. Damage caused by natural or other disasters, war or damage to the switching farm and/or servers used by Bezeq for its core cellular a
ctivities could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Bezeq’s cellular business uses two frequency ranges: 850 MHz and 2100 MHz. These frequencies are exposed to interruptions and could impair service quality of the networks that it operates.

 

Bezeq’s operations and business may be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages and other labor related disputes.

 

As part of its preparations for the intensifying competition in the market sector and for greater efficiency of its operations, Bezeq is continuing to formulate plans for organizational changes and a further reduction in its headcount. The implementation of these plans involves coordination with Bezeq’s employees and substantial costs, including the costs of early retirement in amounts exceeding existing agreements. The implementation of these plans has caused labor unrest, which could harm Bezeq’s regular business.

 

In connection with the sale by Ap.Sb.Ar. Holdings Ltd. of the controlling interest in Bezeq to us, the employees of Bezeq demanded additional compensation under a new collective bargaining agreement. On March 25, 2010, Bezeq received a strike notice from the labor union that represents Bezeq’s employees. On May 2, 2010, the labor union announced that it will begin to initiate limited work stoppages.  If Bezeq’s employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Bezeq could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a new collective bargaining agreement could significantly increase Bezeq’s costs for wages and other benefits, 
which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

 

Bezeq and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, which could result in them being ordered to pay significant sums.

 

Bezeq and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, including class actions, which could result in them being ordered to pay significant sums, the amount of which cannot be estimated. Class action claims can reach large amounts, as virtually all residents of Israel are consumers of Bezeq’s services and a claim that relates to a minor loss for a single consumer can become a material claim for Bezeq if it is certified as a class action applicable to all consumers or a significant portion of them. In addition, since Bezeq provides communications infrastructure as well as billing services to other licensees, parties suing those licensees in other class actions are also likely to try to involve Bezeq as a party to such proceedings.

 

The market in which Bezeq operates is characterized by material capital investments in infrastructure and subscriber equipment and changing technology, which imposes a heavy financial burden on Bezeq.

 

The market in which Bezeq operates is characterized by material capital investments in infrastructure and subscriber equipment and changing technology. The frequent technological changes in infrastructure and terminal equipment and the fierce competition in various market segments impose a heavy financial burden on the companies operating in the market, requiring them to update their infrastructure technology from time to time or to introduce new devices into the market at heavy cost. The development of new technologies can render existing technologies obsolete, resulting in the need for large monetary investments in order to retain a competitive position. Bezeq’s future success will depend on its ability to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new infrastructure and subscriber equipment that keep pace 
with technological developments. If Bezeq is unable to respond promptly and effectively to changing technology, it will be unable to compete effectively in the future and its business could be adversely affected.

Bezeq’s results of operations are subject to market risks such as currency fluctuations, inflation in Israel and the financial condition of the market in Israel and worldwide.

 

Bezeq’s results of operations are subject to market risks such as currency fluctuations, inflation in Israel and the financial condition of the market in Israel and worldwide. Bezeq measures exposure to changes in exchange rates and inflation by the surplus or deficit of assets against liabilities, based on the type of linkage. In addition, Bezeq’s exposure to inflation changes in Israel is high.  Bezeq’s also has exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating primarily to its borrowings.

 

Bezeq collects payments from part of its costumers in foreign currency, primarily U.S. dollars. In addition, Bezeq consumes services from suppliers outside Israel and pays for these services in foreign currency, primarily U.S. dollars. Changes in the exchange rates of the currencies in which Bezeq operates, primarily the New Israeli Shekel against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on Bezeq’s cash flow and profitability.

 

Market and financial stability and the strength of the economy in Israel and worldwide have recently been subject to great volatility and led to a global economic slowdown. Although global economic conditions have begun to stabilize or improve, if the local market continues to be weak or weakens further, Bezeq’s business results could be harmed and its revenues may decline.

 

Risks Related to Our Company

 

Changes in the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq may adversely affect the pro forma financial information incorporated by reference in this prospectus and our financial statements going forward

 

As part of our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq, we have prepared a preliminary purchase price allocation for the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.  This is a complex process and may not be finalized until 12 months after the transaction date, and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price is subject to adjustment.  If, for any reason, we find it necessary or appropriate to make adjustments to such purchase price allocation, this may result in significant changes to the pro forma financial information incorporated by reference in this prospectus and may result in materially adverse changes to our financial statements going forward, as compared to the accounting treatment reflected in the pro forma financial 
information incorporated by reference in this prospectus.

 

We have a substantial amount of existing debt, which could restrict our financing and operating flexibility and have other adverse consequences.

 

To facilitate the funding of our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq, we entered into two financing agreements under which we received loans in a total principal amount of NIS 5.0 billion (approximately $1.35 billion). The financing agreements include certain financial covenants, including, among other things, the requirement that Bezeq maintain certain minimum shareholders equity and minimum ratio of shareholders’ equity. In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary that directly holds the Bezeq interest must maintain a minimum ratio of debt to EBITDA and a debt service coverage ratio. The Bezeq shares we acquired and all of such subsidiary’s other rights and assets (except additional shares of Bezeq that it might acquire in the future) have been pledged to the lenders as security under the loan agreement. In a
ddition, we have pledged to the lenders the entire equity we hold in the subsidiary we established to acquire the Bezeq shares and the debt owed by such subsidiary. Our ability to repay our debt may be affected by Bezeq’s distribution policy and the amount of dividends we receive from Bezeq. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or comply with our debt covenants, we could be forced to renegotiate or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Our ability to sell our holdings in Bezeq is limited by the terms of the loan agreements, as well as the terms of the control permit issued to us in connection with our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq.  We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.

If we, Internet Gold or any other member of the Eurocom group subject to the control permit for the acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq fails to comply with such permit or other regulatory provisions relating to the control of Bezeq, the control permit could be revoked and our rights with respect to our Bezeq interest would be adversely impacted, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.

 

As part of our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq, we, Internet Gold, our indirect fully owned-subsidiary which holds the Bezeq interest, or SP2, our wholly-owned subsidiary that directly owns such subsidiary and other members of the Eurocom group were granted a permit to control Bezeq, pursuant to the Communications Law and the Communications Order (Determination Of Essential Service Provided By “Bezeq” The Israel Telecommunication Corp., Limited), 5757-1997, or the Communications Order. The control permit includes several conditions, including, among others, the requirement that SP2 be controlled exclusively by the other parties to the control permit and that the parties to the control permit hold not less than 30% of any type of means of control of Bezeq and SP2.  In addition, the control permi
t requires that a certain percentage of SP2 be held at all times by an “Israeli Party,” as defined in the Communications Order. The control permit also includes certain notice requirements regarding changes in the composition of the board of directors and certain holdings in us and Internet Gold. If we, Internet Gold or any other member of the Eurocom group subject to the control permit fails to comply with the terms of the control permit or with other regulatory provisions relating to the control of Bezeq, such permit could be revoked and our rights with respect to our Bezeq interest would be adversely impacted, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.

 

If we do not maintain control of Bezeq we may be deemed to be an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 

Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act, defines an investment company as any issuer that is, holds itself out as being, or proposes to be, primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act) having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. However, an issuer will be deemed not to be an investment company if no
 more than 45% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) consists of, and no more than 45% of such issuer’s net income after taxes (for the last four fiscal quarters combined) is derived from, securities other than, among other things, securities issued by companies which are controlled primarily by such issuer. Primary control is presumed if the issuer owns over 25% of the controlled company’s voting securities and the issuer has control greater than that of any other person. Accordingly, so long as we maintain control of Bezeq, we will not be deemed an investment company.

 



  



C - 13







  



 

If we were to no longer maintain the control of Bezeq, we could, among other things, be required either (i) to change substantially the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being subject to the Investment Company Act or (ii) to register as an investment company.  An investment company that is organized under the laws of a foreign country may not register as an investment company, or publicly offer its securities through interstate commerce in the United States, unless the company applies to the SEC for an order permitting the company to register under the Investment Company Act, and to make a public offering in the United States. The SEC may issue an order granting the application if it finds that, by reason of special circumstances or arrangements, it is both legally and practically feasible effectively to e
nforce the provisions of the Investment Company Act against the issuer, and further finds that granting the application is otherwise consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.

 

If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with certain affiliates, reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements, and meeting these requirements would be costly, if at all possible.

 

We may be unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our securities.

 

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its combined subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are relatively new and complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules.

 

Beginning in the 2010 second quarter, we began consolidating Bezeq’s financials results into our financial statements following our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq.  Effective for the year ended December 31, 2011, our management report on internal control over financial reporting must include our assessment with respect to Bezeq’s internal control over financial reporting. Prior to our acquisition of the controlling interest, Bezeq was not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  We may in the future identify a material weakness in Bezeq’s internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities and could have a material adverse effect on our o
perating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information and the market price of our securities.

 

Risks Related to Our Relationship with Internet Gold and Eurocom Communications.

 

Because Internet Gold and Eurocom Communications control substantially all the voting power of our ordinary shares, investors will not be able to affect the outcome of all shareholder votes.

 

Internet Gold owned approximately 76.62% of our outstanding ordinary shares, and Eurocom Communications beneficially owned 77.99% of our outstanding ordinary shares, as of August 30, 2010. Mr. Shaul Elovitch, the chairman of our board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors of Internet Gold and its parent, Eurocom Communications, and the controlling shareholder of Eurocom Communications, will be able to exercise control over our operations and business strategy and control the outcome of all matters involving shareholder approval.

 



  



C - 14







  



 

For as long as Internet Gold has a controlling interest in our company, it, Eurocom Communications and Mr. Elovitch indirectly, will have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to potential mergers or other business combinations involving us, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our incurrence of indebtedness, our issuance of any additional ordinary shares or other equity securities, our repurchase or redemption of ordinary shares and our payment of dividends.  Similarly, as long as Eurocom Communications has a controlling interest in Internet Gold, our corporate parent, Eurocom Communications and Mr. Elovitch will have the power to determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, inclu
ding the power to elect all of the members of our board of directors (except outside directors, within the meaning of Israeli law), prevent an acquisition or any other change in control of us.  Because the interests of Internet Gold and Mr. Elovitch may differ from the interests of our other shareholders, actions taken by Internet Gold with respect to us may not be favorable to our other shareholders.

 

Conflicts of interest may arise between Internet Gold, Eurocom Communications, other companies within the Eurocom group and us that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and result in reduced revenues and income.

 

Conflicts of interest may arise between Internet Gold, Eurocom Communications and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships.  Areas in which conflicts of interest between Internet Gold, Eurocom Communications and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:

 





  


●


Cross officerships, directorships and share ownership.  The ownership interests of our directors in the ordinary shares of Internet Gold could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the two companies. For example, these decisions could relate to the nature, quality and cost of services rendered to us by Internet Gold and Eurocom Communications, disagreements over the desirability of a potential acquisition opportunity or employee retention or recruiting. In addition, Internet Gold may take an opportunity for itself or preclude us from taking advantage of a corporate opportunity; and




 





  


●


Intercompany transactions.  From time to time, Internet Gold, Eurocom Communications or other companies within the Eurocom group may enter into transactions with us or our subsidiaries or other affiliates. Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between employees of such companies and us and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of our independent directors or a committee of disinterested directors and in some instances a vote of shareholders, the terms of any such transactions may not be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained in arm’s-length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties.




 

Risks Related to an Offering and Our Ordinary Shares

 

Our share price has been volatile and may decline in the future.

 

The market price of our ordinary shares has been subject to significant price movements and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:

 



  



C - 15







  



 





  


●


quarterly variations in our operating results, which beginning in the 2010 second quarter include the operations of Bezeq;




 





  


●


global economic conditions;




 





  


●


price movements in the market price of Bezeq’s ordinary shares;




 





  


●


operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;




 





  


●


changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;




 





  


●


regulatory changes that impact pricing of services and competition in Bezeq’s markets;




 





  


●


changes in market valuations of other communications companies;




 





  


●


announcements of technological innovations or new services by Bezeq or its competitors;




 





  


●


announcements by Bezeq or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;




 





  


●


changes in the status of Bezeq’s intellectual property rights;




 





  


●


announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us or Bezeq;




 





  


●


additions or departures of key personnel;




 





  


●


future sales of our ordinary shares; and




 





  


●


stock market price and volume fluctuations.




 

Domestic and international stock markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events or hostilities in or surrounding Israel, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares.

 

We have never paid cash dividends to our shareholders and have not adopted a dividend distribution policy.

 

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our ordinary shares and have not adopted a dividend distribution policy. Our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, B Communications (SP2) Ltd., which directly holds Bezeq’s shares and our principal source of revenues and income, is subject to limitations on the payment of dividends under the terms of the financing agreements entered into in connection with its acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investments.

 

We may in the future be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which will subject our U.S. investors to adverse tax rules.

 

There is a risk that we may be treated in the future as a “passive foreign investment company.” Our treatment as a passive foreign investment company could result in a reduction in the after-tax return to the U.S. holders of our ordinary shares may cause a reduction in the value of such shares. A foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of “passive income,” or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation’s gross assets produce, or are held for the production of, such types of “passive income.” For purposes of these tests, “passive income” includes dividends, interest and gains from the sale or exchange of
 investment property; and cash is considered to be an asset that produces passive income. If we are classified in the future as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, highly complex rules would apply to U.S. shareholders owning ordinary shares. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the application of such rules.

Risks Related to the Operations of Bezeq and our Company in Israel

 

Bezeq conducts its operations in Israel and its business focuses on the Israeli audience, therefore our results of operations may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel.

 

We and Bezeq are incorporated and based in the State of Israel and Bezeq derives substantially all of its revenues from markets within the State of Israel. As a result, the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel directly influence Bezeq and us. Any major hostilities involving Israel, a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the Israeli army, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel could have a material adverse effect on Bezeq’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Israel and its Arab neighbors have engaged in a number of armed conflicts.  A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Major hostilities between Israel and its neighbors may hinder Israel’s international trade and lead to economic downturn. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.  Ongoing violence between Israel and the Palestinians as well as tension between Israel and the neighboring countries may have a material adverse effect on Bezeq’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

Many of Bezeq’s and our executive officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli Defense Forces and may be called for active duty under emergency circumstances at any time.  If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. Bezeq’s operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of one or more of its executive officers or key employees or a significant number of other employees due to military service.  Any disruption in Bezeq’s operations could adversely affect its business.

 

Bezeq may be restricted in the conduct of its operations during periods of national emergency, which could negatively affect its business operations.

 

During periods of national emergency, the Minister of Communications and other governmental authorities may issue various instructions regarding the use of Bezeq’s network, including the use of the network by the Israeli security forces. In addition, the Israeli Equipment Registration and IDF Mobilization Law, 1987 permits the registration, taking and use of engineering equipment and facilities by Israel’s Defense Forces. These actions could adversely affect Bezeq’s business operations.

 

Our operating results may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations of the NIS against foreign currencies and in the consumer price index in Israel.

 

We and Bezeq report our financial results in NIS. Bezeq receives payments in NIS for most of its sales and the remainder in foreign currency, primarily U.S. dollars.  In addition, Bezeq consumes services from suppliers outside Israel and pays for these services in foreign currency, primarily U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in rates of exchange between NIS and the U.S. dollar may affect our operating results and financial condition.  In addition, when the Israeli inflation rate exceeds the rate of the NIS depreciation against foreign currencies, some of our NIS expenses increase to the extent of the difference between the rates. A significant disparity of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

 



  



C - 17







  



 

From time to time, we engage in currency hedging transactions to reduce the impact on our cash flows and results of operations of currency fluctuations.  We recognize freestanding derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities in our statements of financial position and we measure those instruments at fair value. However, accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument, such as a currency hedging instrument, depends on the intended use of the derivative instrument and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in our income statement without any reference to the change in value of the related budgeted expenditures. These differences could result in fluctuations in our reported net income on a q
uarterly basis.

 

Further, as the principal amount of, and interest that we pay on, our Series B Debentures are linked to the Israeli consumer price index, any increase in the Israeli consumer price index will increase our financial expenses and could adversely affect our results.

 

As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we may follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements.

 

As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the NASDAQ Listing Rules.  As a foreign private issuer listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we may follow home country practice with regard to, among other things, the composition of the board of directors, compensation of officers, director nomination process and quorum at shareholders’ meetings. In addition, we may follow home country practice instead of the NASDAQ requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events (such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity-based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of the company, certain transactions other than a pub
lic offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the company and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company). A foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of NASDAQ requirements must submit to NASDAQ in advance a written statement from an independent counsel in such issuer’s home country certifying that the issuer’s practices are not prohibited by the home country’s laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer must disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC each such requirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer instead of any such requirement. Accordingly, our shareholders may not be afforded the same protection as provided under NASDAQ’s corporate governance rules.

 

Our shareholders generally may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment against us, our executive officers and directors and some of the experts named in this prospectus, or asserting U.S. securities law claims in Israel.

 

We are incorporated in Israel and all of our executive officers and directors named in this prospectus reside outside the United States. Service of process upon them may be difficult to effect within the United States.  Furthermore, all of our assets and most of the assets of our executive officers and directors and some of the experts named in this prospectus are located outside the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against us or any of them in the United States, including one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult for you to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel.

Provisions of Israeli law, the licenses of Bezeq and our articles of association may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of our company, which could prevent a change of control and, therefore, depress the price of our shares.

 

Following our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq, we and our shareholders are required to comply with the Communications Law, the Communications Order and regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Communications.

 

Pursuant to the Communications Order, we were required to obtain the prior written consent of the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli Minister of Communications in order to acquire the controlling interest in Bezeq. Under the Communications Order, no person may acquire, directly or indirectly, the ability to exercise “significant influence” over Bezeq or 5% or more of any particular class of means of control in Bezeq, nor may any person, together with any other person, appoint the general manager of Bezeq or cause the election or appointment of any director of Bezeq, without the prior written consent of the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli Minister of Communications. Subject to certain exceptions, prior written approval of such Ministers is also required to increase the holdings or other rights in excess of 
those determined in the initial approval, including by means of an agreement (including a voting agreement). Furthermore, under the Communications Order, no person may transfer control, “significant influence” or means of control in Bezeq to another, if, as a result of the transfer, the holdings of the transferee would require approval pursuant to the Communications Law or Communications Order and the transferee is not in possession of the requisite approval. For the foregoing purposes, “significant influence” means the ability to significantly influence the activity of a corporation, whether alone or together with or through others, directly or indirectly, as a result of holding means of control in that corporation or in another corporation, including ability derived from the corporation’s articles of association, a written, oral or other kind of agreement, or from any other source, excluding solely as a result of the performance of an office holder’s duties in the corpor
ation. In this context, holding 25% of our means of control is presumed to confer significant influence. ”Means of control” means the right to vote at a general meeting of the company, to appoint a director or general manager of the company, to participate in the profits of the company or a share of the remaining assets of the company after payment of its debts upon liquidation.

 

Israeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions.  Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to us or to some of our shareholders, including Israeli shareholders and shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel exempting such shareholders from Israeli tax. For example, Israeli tax law does not recognize tax-free share exchanges to the same extent as U.S. tax law. With respect to mergers, Israeli tax law allows for tax deferral in certain circumstances but makes the deferral contingent on the fulfillme
nt of numerous conditions, including a holding period of two years from the date of the transaction during which sales and dispositions of shares of the participating companies are restricted. Moreover, with respect to certain share swap transactions, the tax deferral is limited in time, and when the time expires, tax then becomes payable even if no actual disposition of the shares has occurred.  These provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of our company, which could prevent a change of control and therefore depress the price of our shares.

 



  



C - 19







  



 

The rights and responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by Israeli law and differ in some respects from those under Delaware law.

 

Because we are an Israeli company, the rights and responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by our articles of association and by Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in a Delaware corporation.  In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith towards the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his, her or its power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these duties are applicable to shareholder votes on, among other things, amendments to a company’s articles of association, increases in a company’s authorized share capital, mergers and interested party transactio
ns requiring shareholder approval. In addition, a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholders’ vote or to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or executive officer in the company has a duty of fairness towards the company. However, Israeli law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness.  Because Israeli corporate law has undergone extensive revisions in recent years, there is little case law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior.

3.10


Description of Ordinary Shares




 

Set out below is a description of certain provisions of our Articles of Association and of the Israeli Companies Law, the Communications Law and the Communications Order related to such provisions.  This description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the Articles of Association.

 

Purposes and Objects of the Company

 

We are a public company registered under the Israel Companies Law, 1999-5759, or the Israeli Companies Law, as B Communications Ltd., registration number 512832742. Our objects and purposes, as provided by our Articles of Association, are to carry on any lawful activity.

 

The Powers of the Directors

 

Under the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law and our Articles of Association, a director cannot participate in a meeting nor vote on a proposal, arrangement or contract in which he or she is personally interested unless such proposal, arrangement or contract is in the ordinary course of business or the majority of directors are personally interested in such proposal, arrangement or contract. In the event the majority of the members of the board of directors have a personal interest in the proposed transaction, approval of our shareholders at a general meeting is required. In addition, our directors cannot vote compensation to themselves or any members of their body without the approval of our audit committee and our shareholders at a general meeting.

 

The authority of our directors to enter into borrowing arrangements on our behalf is not limited, except in the same manner as any other transaction by us.

 

Under our Articles of Association, retirement of directors from office is not subject to any age limitation and our directors are not required to own shares in our company in order to qualify to serve as directors.

 

Rights Attached to Shares

 

Our authorized share capital consists of 50,000,000 ordinary shares of a nominal value of NIS 0.1 each. All of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Our ordinary shares are not redeemable and do not have preemptive rights.

 



  



C - 22







  



 

Dividend and Liquidation Rights. The holders of the ordinary shares will be entitled to their proportionate share of any cash dividend, share dividend or dividend in kind declared with respect to our ordinary shares. Our board of directors may declare a dividend to be paid to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the paid up capital attributable to the shares that they hold. Dividends may only be paid out of our profits and other surplus funds, as defined in the Israeli Companies Law, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year or as accrued over a period of two years, whichever is higher, provided that there is no reasonable concern that a payment of a dividend will prevent us from satisfying our existing and foreseeable obligations as they becom
e due. If we do not meet the profit requirement, we may seek the approval of the court to distribute a dividend. The court may approve our request if it is convinced that there is no reasonable risk that a distribution might prevent us from satisfying our existing and anticipated obligations as they become due.

 

Under the Israeli Companies Law, a dividend declaration must be approved by the board of directors and does not require the approval of the shareholders of a company unless the company’s articles of association provide otherwise. Our articles of association do not require shareholder approval of a dividend distribution.

 

In the event of our liquidation, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, our assets will be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the paid up capital attributable to the shares that they hold. Dividend and liquidation rights may be affected by the grant of preferential dividend or distribution rights to the holders of a class of shares with preferential rights that may be authorized in the future.

 

Exceptional Holdings; Principal Shareholders. Under the Communications Order, no person may acquire, directly or indirectly, the ability to exercise “significant influence” over Bezeq or 5% or more of any particular class of means of control in Bezeq, nor may any person, together with any other person, appoint the general manager of Bezeq or cause the election or appointment of any director of Bezeq, without the prior written consent of the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli Minister of Communications. Subject to certain exceptions, prior written approval of such Ministers is also required to increase the holdings or other rights in excess of those determined in the initial approval, including by means of an agreement (including a voting ag
reement). Furthermore, under the Communications Order, no person may transfer control, “significant influence” or means of control in Bezeq to another, if, as a result of the transfer, the holdings of the transferee would require approval pursuant to the Communications Law or Communications Order and the transferee is not in possession of the requisite approval. Any such unauthorized acquisition is referred to as “Exceptional Holdings.” For the foregoing purposes, “significant influence” means the ability to significantly influence the activity of a corporation, whether alone or together with or through others, directly or indirectly, as a result of holding means of control in that corporation or in another corporation, including ability derived from the corporation’s articles of association, a written, oral or other kind of agreement, or from any other source, excluding solely as a result of the performance of an office holder’s duties in the corporation. In t
his context, holding 25% of our means of control is presumed to confer significant influence. ”Means of control” means the right to vote at a general meeting of the company, to appoint a director or general manager of the company, to participate in the profits of the company or a share of the remaining assets of the company after payment of its debts upon liquidation.

 

In compliance with the Communications Law and Communications Order following our acquisition of the controlling interest in Bezeq, our Articles of Association provide that Exceptional Holdings will not entitle the holder to any rights in respect of such holdings, unless and to the extent permitted under the Communications Order. Accordingly, Exceptional Holdings will not have any voting rights at a general meeting of shareholders. Each shareholder participating in a general meeting of shareholders will be required to certify to us prior to the vote or, if the shareholder is voting by a proxy or any similar instrument, on such proxy card or similar instrument, as to whether or not his or her holdings in our company or his or her vote require the approval of the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli Minister of Communications, purs
uant to the Communications Law and Communications Order. In addition, no director may be appointed, elected or removed from office by virtue of the vote of a holder of Exceptional Holdings. If a director is appointed, elected or removed from office by virtue of the vote of a holder of Exceptional Holdings, such appointment, election or removal from office will be void.

 



  



C - 23







  



 

Under our Articles of Association, any person holding a number of our shares that requires approval under the Communications Order shall notify us, Bezeq, the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli Minister of Communications of such holdings in writing, no later than 48 hours from the date of acquiring such holdings.

 

Our Articles of Association include reporting requirements applicable to “Principal Shareholders,” meaning a holder, directly or indirectly, of 5% of our issued and outstanding share capital. Any person who, after acquiring, directly or indirectly, shares in our company becomes a “Principal Shareholder,” is required, no later than 48 hours after becoming a Principal Shareholder, to notify us in writing, specifying the number of our shares held by such shareholder and the date on which such shareholder became a Principal Shareholder. Any person who ceases to be a Principal Shareholder is required, no later than 48 hours thereafter, to notify us in writing of the date on which such person ceased to be a Principal Shareholder. In addition, a Principal Shareholder is required to notify us in writing of any aggreg
ate change in its holdings of our shares in an aggregate amount equal to 1% or more of our outstanding share capital compared to the last notice of holdings submitted by such Principal Shareholder, no later than 48 hours after such change. In the event a Principal Shareholder fails to provide any required notice, as discussed above, then until such Principal Shareholder provides us with the requisite notice, the Principal Shareholder will not be entitled to any rights in respect of such shares and the provisions of the Communications Order with respect to the exercise of rights underlying Exceptional Holdings will apply, and the undisclosed holdings shall also be deemed “dormant shares,” as defined under the Israeli Companies Law.

 

Under our Articles of Associations, we are required to notify the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli Minister of Communications of any Exceptional Holdings immediately upon becoming aware of such event. We are also required to notify such Ministers in the event a shareholder becomes a Principal Shareholder and regarding any change in the holdings of a Principal Shareholder within 48 hours of becoming aware of such change.

 

Voting Rights. Holders of ordinary shares have one vote for each ordinary share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, subject to the restrictions described above relating to Exceptional Holdings and Principal Shareholders. Such voting rights may be affected by the grant of any special voting rights to the holders of a class of shares with preferential rights that may be authorized in the future.

 

Ownership or Voting of Ordinary Shares by Non-Residents of Israel. Shares held by citizens of countries which are in a state of war with Israel will not confer any rights to their holders unless the Israeli Ministry of Finance consents otherwise.

 

Election of Directors

 

Our ordinary shares do not have cumulative rights for the election of directors. Rather, under our articles of association, our directors (other than the outside directors) are elected by a vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power represented and voting at our annual general meetings of shareholders, and hold office until the next annual general meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been elected.  Internet Gold, our controlling shareholder, is able to elect all of our directors other than our outside directors.  All the members of our Board of Directors (except the outside directors) may be reelected upon completion of their term of office.

 



  



C - 24







  



 

Under our Articles of Association, provisions relating to the election and removal of directors who are not outside directors, within the meaning of the Israeli Companies Law, may not be modified without the prior written consent of the Israeli Minister of Communications.

 

Regulations promulgated under the Communications Law require that our chief executive officer, any member of our board of directors holding an executive role, as well as a majority of the members of the board of directors, be citizens and residents of the State of Israel.

 

Annual and Extraordinary Meetings

 

Under the Israeli Companies Law and our articles of association, our board of directors must convene an annual meeting of shareholders at least once every calendar year and within 15 months of the last annual meeting. Depending on the matter to be voted upon, and subject to the Israeli Companies Law and regulations thereunder, notice of at least 14 days or 21 days or 35 days prior to the date of the meeting is required. Our articles of association provide that notice of a general meeting of shareholders will be delivered to all eligible shareholders by publication in two daily Hebrew language newspapers in Israel that have a reasonably-sized readership. Our board of directors may, in its discretion, convene additional meetings as “special general meetings.” In addition, the board must convene a special general meeting up
on the demand of: (a) two of the directors or 25% of the nominated directors, (b) one or more shareholders having at least 5% of the outstanding share capital and at least 1% of the voting power in the company, or (c) one or more shareholders having at least 5% of the voting power in the company. The chairman of the board of directors presides at each of our general meetings. The chairman of the board of directors is not entitled to a vote at a general meeting in his capacity as chairman.

 

Quorum

 

The quorum required for any general meeting is the presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders holding or representing, in the aggregate, at least one third of the voting rights. No business shall be considered or determined at a general meeting, unless the requisite quorum is present within half an hour from the time designated for the general meeting. If within half an hour from the time designated for the general meeting a quorum is not present, the general meeting shall stand adjourned to the same day in the following week, at the same time and place, or to such other time as designated in the notice of such adjourned meeting. If within half an hour from the time designated for the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present, any number of shareholders present will constitute a quorum. However, if the general meeting was conv
ened on the demand of shareholders, the adjourned meeting shall take place only if there are present at least the number of shareholders required to convene a general meeting under our articles of association (as discussed above).

 

An adjourned meeting that is convened on the demand of shareholders may take place only if there are present at least the number of shareholders required to convene such a meeting.

 

A general meeting in which a quorum is present may resolve to adjourn the meeting, the discussion or the vote on a matter included in the agenda to such other time and place as it may determine. Only matters that were on the agenda and in respect of which no resolution was passed shall be discussed at the adjourned meeting.

 



  



C - 25







  



 

Resolutions

 

An ordinary resolution requires approval by the holders of a simple majority of the voting rights represented at the meeting, in person, by proxy or by written ballot, and voting on the resolution.

 

Under the Israeli Companies Law, unless otherwise provided in the articles of association or applicable law, all resolutions of the shareholders require a simple majority. A resolution for the voluntary winding up of the company requires approval by holders of 75% of the voting rights represented at the meeting, in person, by proxy or by written ballot and voting on the resolution.

 

Modification of Class Rights

 

Under the Israeli Companies Law and our articles of association, any amendment, conversion, cancellation, expansion, addition to or other change in the rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions or provisions attached to any particular class of shares issued to shareholders of our company, shall require the written consent of holders of all issued shares of such particular class, or authorization by an ordinary resolution adopted at an extraordinary meeting of such class.

 

Limitations on the Rights to Own Ordinary Shares in Our Company

 

None of our memorandum of association, our articles of association or the laws of the State of Israel restrict in any way the ownership or voting of ordinary shares by non-residents, except that shares held by citizens of countries which are in a state of war with Israel will not confer any rights to their holders unless the Ministry of Finance consents otherwise.

 

In addition, pursuant to the Communications Order, so long as we control Bezeq, any state, corporation controlled by a state or a governmental corporation or a corporation controlled by a governmental corporation cannot control our company. Ownership of our shares, directly or indirectly, by a governmental corporation requires the prior written approval of the Israeli Prime Minister. A “Hostile State,” as such term is defined in the Communications Order, a citizen or resident of a Hostile State, a corporation incorporated in a Hostile State or controlled by a resident or citizen of a Hostile State is not allowed to hold, directly or indirectly, 5% or more or a “significant influence” (as described above) in Bezeq. Ownership, directly or indirectly, of 5% or more of Bezeq’s outstanding shares or a “
;significant influence” (as described above) in Bezeq requires the approval of the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli Minister of Communications as well as the consent of the Israeli Minister of Defense.

 

Anti-Takeover Provisions; Mergers and Acquisitions

 

Full Tender Offer. A person wishing to acquire shares, or any class of shares, of a publicly traded Israeli company and who would as a result hold over 90% of the company’s issued and outstanding share capital, or a class of shares which are listed, is required by the Israeli Companies Law to make a tender offer to all of the company’s shareholders for the purchase of all of the remaining issued and outstanding shares of the company, or any class of shares, as the case may be. If the shareholders who do not respond to the offer hold less than 5% of the issued share capital of the company, or of the relevant class of shares, all of the shares that the acquirer offered to purchase will be transferred to the acquirer by operation of law. However, the shareholders may 
petition the court within three months after receipt of the offer to alter the consideration for the acquisition. If the dissenting shareholders hold more than 5% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company, the acquirer may not acquire additional shares of the company from shareholders who accepted the tender offer if following such acquisition the acquirer would then own over 90% of the company’s issued and outstanding share capital.

Special Tender Offer. The Israeli Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares of a public company be made by means of a special tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would hold 25% or more of the voting rights at the company’s general meeting, unless one of the exemptions described in the Israeli Companies Law are met. This rule does not apply if there is already another shareholder who holds 25% or more of the voting rights at the company’s general meeting. Our parent, Internet Gold, currently holds more than 25% of our outstanding ordinary shares as determined in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law. Similarly, the Israeli Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tende
r offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would hold more than 45% of the voting rights of the company, if there is no other shareholder of the company who holds more than 45% of the voting rights in the company. A tender offer is not required in the following circumstances: (i) the purchase was made in a private placement that was approved by the shareholders as a private placement and was meant to grant the purchaser 25% or more of the voting rights of a company in which no other shareholder holds 25% or more of the voting rights, or to grant the purchaser more than 45% of the voting rights of a company in which no other shareholder holds more than 45% of the voting rights, (ii) the purchaser would hold 25% or more of the voting rights after purchasing shares from a person that held 25% or more of the voting rights, or (iii) the purchaser would hold more than 45% of the voting rights after purchasing shares from a person that held more than 45% of the voting rights.

 

Merger. The Israeli Companies Law permits merger transactions if approved by each party’s board of directors and, unless certain requirements described under the Israeli Companies Law are met, the majority of each party’s shares voted on the proposed merger at a shareholders’ meeting called on at least 35 days’ prior notice. Under the Israeli Companies Law, if the approval of a general meeting of the shareholders is required, merger transactions may be approved by holders of a simple majority of the shares present, in person or by proxy, at a general meeting and voting on the transaction. In determining whether the required majority has approved the merger, if shares of the company are held by the other party to the merger, or by any person holding at l
east 25% of the outstanding voting shares or 25% of the means of appointing directors of the other party to the merger, then a vote against the merger by holders of the majority of the shares present and voting, excluding shares held by the other party or by such person, or anyone acting on behalf of either of them, is sufficient to reject the merger transaction. If the transaction would have been approved but for the exclusion of the votes of certain shareholders as provided above, a court may still approve the merger upon the request of holders of at least 25% of the voting rights of a company, if the court holds that the merger is fair and reasonable, taking into account the value of the parties to the merger and the consideration offered to the shareholders. Upon the request of a creditor of either party to the proposed merger, the court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there exists a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will be unable to satisfy t
he obligations of any of the parties to the merger and the court may also provide instructions to assure the rights of creditors. In addition, a merger may not be completed unless at least 50 days have passed from the date that a proposal for approval of the merger was filed with the Israeli Registrar of Companies and 30 days from the date that shareholder approval of both merging companies was obtained.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a merger is not subject to shareholders approval if (i) the target company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the acquiring company and (ii) the acquiring company is issuing to the shareholders of the target company up to 20% of its share capital and no person will become, as a result of the merger, a controlling shareholder, subject to certain limitation relating to the continuing of the votes, at a meeting of the shareholders of a company that is a party to the merger, of any entity or person that is either the other party to the merger or a control person thereof.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers




 

Exculpation of Office Holders

 

The Israeli Companies Law provides that an Israeli company cannot exculpate an office holder from liability with respect to a breach of his duty of loyalty, but may, if permitted by its articles of association, exculpate in advance an office holder from his liability to the company, in whole or in part, with respect to a breach of his or her duty of care. However, a company may not exculpate in advance a director from his or her liability to the company with respect to a breach of his duty of care in the event of distributions.

 

Insurance for Office Holders

 

The Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may, if permitted by its articles of association, enter into a contract for the insurance of liability of any of its office holders arising from their acts or omissions performed in such capacity for:

 





  


●


A breach of his or her duty of care to the company or to another person;




 





  


●


A breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable cause to assume that his act would not prejudice the company’s interests; and




 





  


●


A financial liability imposed upon the office holder in favor of another person.




 

Indemnification of Office Holders

 

The Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may, if permitted by its articles of association, indemnify an office holder for acts or omissions performed by the office holder in such capacity for:

 





  


●


A financial liability imposed on the office holder in favor of another person by any judgment, including a settlement or an arbitrator’s award approved by a court;




 





  


●


Reasonable litigation expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually incurred by the office holder as a result of an investigation or proceeding instituted against him or her by a competent authority, provided that such investigation or proceeding concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder or the imposition of any financial liability in lieu of criminal proceedings, or concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder and a financial liability was imposed on the officer holder in lieu of criminal proceedings with respect to a criminal offense that does not require proof of criminal intent; and




 





  


●


Reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by such office holder or which were imposed on him by a court, in proceedings the company instituted against the office holder or that were instituted on the company’s behalf or by another person, or in a criminal charge from which the office holder was acquitted, or in a criminal proceeding in which the office holder was convicted of a crime which does not require proof of criminal intent.




 



  



C - 30







  



 

In accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, a company’s articles of association may permit the company to:

 





  


●


Undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder, except that with respect to a financial liability imposed on the office holder by any judgment, settlement or court-approved arbitration award, the undertaking must be limited to types of occurrences, which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, are, at the time of the undertaking, foreseeable due to the company’s activities and to an amount or standard that the board of directors has determined is reasonable under the circumstances; and




 





  


●


Retroactively indemnify an office holder of the company.




 

Limitations on Exculpation, Insurance and Indemnification

 

The Israeli Companies Law provides that neither a provision of the articles of association permitting the company to enter into a contract to insure the liability of an office holder, nor a provision in the articles of association or a resolution of the board of directors permitting the indemnification of an office holder, nor a provision in the articles of association exempting an office holder from duty to the company shall be valid, where such insurance, indemnification or exemption relates to any of the following:

 





  


●


a breach by the office holder of his duty of loyalty, except with respect to insurance coverage or indemnification if the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to assume that the act would not prejudice the company;




 





  


●


a breach by the office holder of his duty of care if such breach was committed intentionally or recklessly, unless the breach was committed only negligently;




 





  


●


any act or omission committed with intent to derive an unlawful personal gain; and




 





  


●


any fine or forfeiture imposed on the office holder.




 

In addition, pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law, exemption of, procurement of insurance coverage for, an undertaking to indemnify or indemnification of an office holder must be approved by the audit committee and the board of directors and, if such office holder is a director or a controlling shareholder or a relative of the controlling shareholder, also by the shareholders general meeting. A special majority at the general meeting is required if a controlling shareholder is interested in such transaction as an office holder or as a relative of an office holder, as described above.

 

Our articles of association allow us to insure, indemnify and exempt our office holders to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law.  We maintain a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with liability coverage of up to $10 million per claim and in the aggregate.  We have undertaken to indemnify each of our directors and officers to the extent permitted by law, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5 million, to the extent that their liability is not covered under our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy.
