Novartis shall be the acquiring company which shall continue to operate, and Alcon shall be the transferring company which shall be dissolved upon Completion (as defined below). By operation of law, Alcon’s assets, liabilities and contracts shall be transferred to Novartis in their entirety (Universalsukzession).

 





1.2  


Merger Report and Merger Balance Sheet




 





a)  


Merger Report




 

The Novartis board of directors (the full board of directors of Novartis being referred to herein as the “Novartis Board”) and the Alcon board of directors (the full board of directors of Alcon being referred to herein as the “Alcon Board”) shall approve a joint merger report as set forth in art. 14 Merger Act (the “Merger Report”) as soon as practicable but no later than on 19 January 2011.

 





b)  


Merger Balance Sheet




 

The Merger shall be implemented on the basis of the non-consolidated, non-audited interim balance sheets (Zwischenabschlüsse), prepared under Swiss statutory accounting principles as of 30 September 2010 of Novartis and of Alcon, respectively (attached hereto as Exhibit 1.2(b)(i) and Exhibit 1.2(b)(ii), respectively, each a “Merger Balance Sheet”). Each Merger Balance Sheet shall be superseded for purposes of this Merger Agreement by an audited balance sheet of Novartis or of Alcon, as the case may 

 



  



  

  



  



 




 




 CONFIDENTIAL

be, dated 31 December 2010 when such audited balance sheet becomes available, whereupon such audited balance sheet shall become the applicable Merger Balance Sheet.

 

The Merger Consideration (as defined in section 2.1(a) (Stock Consideration and Put Option)) is not based on the Merger Balance Sheets but based on the factors enumerated in section 2.1(d) (Basis for Determining Merger Consideration). In the event that Completion (as described in section 6.5 (Completion)) occurs more than six months after the closing date of the Merger Balance Sheets, the Merger Balance Sheets shall be replaced by updated balance sheets (the “Updated Merger Balance Sheets”) in accordance with art. 11 Merger Act.

Determination of the Merger Consideration




 

The exchange ratio shall be the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten thousandth, or if there shall not be a nearest ten thousandth, the higher ten thousandth, obtained by dividing USD 168 by the Novartis Share Value (the “Exchange Ratio”); provided that the Exchange Ratio shall not be greater than 2.8; provided, further, that if the Novartis Share Value is less than USD 60, then the Exchange Ratio shall be the sum of (x) 2.8 plus (y) the Dividend Adjustment Factor.

 

The “Dividend Adjustment Factor” shall mean the quotient of (x) the product of (i) the Dividend Value Adjustment multiplied by (ii) 2.8 divided by (y) the Novartis Share Value.

 

The “USD Dividend Value” shall mean the amount of any Novartis cash dividend declared or paid after the date of this Merger Agreement (including the 2010 Novartis Annual Dividend) and on or prior to the Completion Date (as defined in section 6.5 (Completion)) per Novartis Share in Swiss Francs converted into US dollars on the basis of the USD/CHF spot rate prevailing at 4:30 pm (London time) on the last day of the Measurement Period (as defined in the definition of “Novartis Share Value”) reported on the Bloomberg Professional Service under function “BFIX.”

 

The “Dividend Value Adjustment” shall mean the lesser of (i) the USD Dividend Value and (ii) USD 60 minus the Novartis Share Value.

 

The “2010 Novartis Annual Dividend” means the dividend with respect to Novartis Shares to be approved at the Novartis annual general meeting in 2011.

 

The “Novartis Share Value” means the average of the Daily Novartis Share Values for each of the ten (10) Trading Days ending on (and including) the Trading Day prior to the date of the Alcon Shareholders’ Meeting (such ten (10) Trading Days, the “Measurement Period”) weighted by the total volume of trading in Novartis Shares as reported on the NOVN.VX VWAP page on the Bloomberg Professional Service each such Trading Day.

 

The “Daily Novartis Share Value” means, for any Trading Day, the Daily Novartis VWAP for such Trading Day converted into US dollars on the basis of the USD/CHF London spot rate prevailing at 4:30 pm (London time) for such Trading Day reported on the Bloomberg Professional Service under function “BFIX” minus, for any Trading Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for any Novartis cash dividend declared or paid after the date of this Merger Agreement and on or prior to the Completion Date, the USD Dividend Value.

 

The “Daily Novartis VWAP” means, for any Trading Day, the per share volume-weighted average price of Novartis Shares as reported on the NOVN.VX VWAP page (which prices are displayed in Swiss Francs) on the Bloomberg Professional Service in respect of the period from the open of trading on the relevant Trading Day to the close of such Trading Day.

 

The “Ex-Dividend Date” means the date on which Novartis Shares first trade on the SIX Swiss Exchange without the right to the applicable dividend.

The “Stock Consideration Value” means the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the Novartis Share Value.

“Novartis Shares” mean ordinary shares of Novartis with a nominal value of CHF 0.50 each.

 





c)  


Adjustment of Merger Consideration




 

The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect the economic effect of any share split, share combination, subdivision, reclassification, stock dividend, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to Alcon Shares or Novartis Shares that (i) is approved after the date hereof but prior to Completion and (ii) is entered into the commercial register, or has a record or effective date that occurs during such period.

 





d)  


Basis for Determining Merger Consideration




 

The Merger Consideration was agreed by the Parties after negotiations based on a variety of different factors including market capitalization and fundamental values of both companies and the proposed terms of the Merger Agreement including the structure of the merger consideration. Prior to the execution of this Merger Agreement, the Alcon Board and the Novartis Board received and considered fairness opinions with respect to the Merger Consideration.

 





2.2  


Implementation of the Exchange




 





a)  


Appointment and Duties of Exchange Agent




 

Novartis shall appoint an Exchange Agent (the “Exchange Agent”) to implement the exchange of Alcon Shares for Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms set out in the agreement between Novartis and the Exchange Agent and this Merger Agreement, including Exhibit 2.2(a). Novartis will, to this effect, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger Consideration is credited to the Exchange Agent as promptly as practicable following Completion.

 

Alcon shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified in this Merger Agreement and as specified in any agreement with the Exchange Agent.

b)  


Entitlement of Alcon Shareholders and Settlement




 

The right to receive the Merger Consideration shall vest by operation of law in those record holders of Alcon Shares (each, an “Alcon Shareholder” and collectively, the “Alcon Shareholders”) who hold Alcon Shares at Completion.

 

Alcon Shareholders can, by returning a properly completed form of election (“Form of Election”) to the Exchange Agent not later than five (5) Trading Days prior to the Alcon Shareholders' Meeting, elect to receive either Novartis Shares (listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange) or an equivalent number of receipts representing Novartis American Depository Shares (listed on the New York Stock Exchange), each Novartis American Depository Share representing one registered Novartis Share (hereinafter each a “Novartis ADS”). The number of Novartis ADSs to be received by any Alcon Shareholder who does not receive Novartis Shares is therefore equal to the number of Novartis Shares otherwise issuable to such Alcon Sha
reholder in accordance with Section 2.1.

 

In case no Form of Election is received, Alcon Shareholders with a registered address in Switzerland shall receive the Stock Consideration in the form of Novartis Shares; Alcon Shareholders with a registered address outside of Switzerland shall receive the Stock Consideration after Completion in the form of Novartis ADSs.

 





c)  


Settlement of Fractions




 

Each shareholder of record of Alcon (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any beneficial owner of Alcon Shares) who, based on its shareholding at Completion and on the Merger Consideration, does not receive an integral number of Novartis Shares or Novartis ADSs shall receive rights corresponding to the resulting fraction (each a “Fraction Right”). The Exchange Agent shall (i) receive all Novartis Shares or Novartis ADSs not used for the share exchange in the Merger because of the existence of Fraction Rights and (ii) sell such shares or ADSs on behalf of the holders of Fraction Rights (on the SIX Swiss Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable) and pass on the proceeds to such shareholders of record of Alcon in cash. This sale shall occur during a period o
f three Trading Days after Completion, as determined by Novartis in a manner reasonably designed to achieve the highest possible sale price.

 





d)  


Exercise of Put Option




 

In the event that the Stock Consideration Value is less than USD 168, the Exchange Agent shall exercise all Put Options included in the Merger Consideration pursuant to section 2.1(a)(ii) (Stock Consideration and Put Option), and (if the Put Options are so exercised) the Exchange Agent shall in accordance with section 2.2(a) (Appointment and Duties of Exchange Agent) pay an amount in cash payable in USD equal to the applicable Contingent Value Amount per Alcon Share (net of applicable Swiss withholding tax) as part of the Merger Consideration in satisfaction of section 2.1(a)(ii) (Stock Consideration and Put Option). Each outstanding Put Option shall terminate and be of no further force and effect (i) following the payment of the Merger Consideration or (ii) in the event the Stock Consideration Value is greater than or equal to USD 168
.

2.3  


Treatment of Certain Share Capital and Equity




 





a)  


Alcon Shares Held by Novartis




 

The Alcon Shares that Novartis holds shall not be exchanged in the Merger, and such Alcon Shares shall be cancelled upon Completion.

 





b)  


Alcon Shares Held by Alcon




 

The Alcon Shares that Alcon or any of its subsidiaries hold shall be exchanged in the Merger and the Novartis Shares so issued in connection therewith may be used by Novartis upon effectiveness of the Merger in the exchange as described in section 2.2 (Implementation of the Exchange) to the extent these Novartis Shares are held by Alcon.

 





c)  


Novartis Shares Held by Alcon




 

Any Novartis Shares that Alcon or any of its subsidiaries may hold at Completion shall be transferred to Novartis by operation of the Merger.

After Completion, all Awards (the “Awards”) as defined in and outstanding under the Amended 2002 Alcon Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) shall be (upon exercise or vesting as applicable) settled in the form of Novartis Shares instead of Alcon Shares and shall be structured so that the beneficiaries shall receive for each Alcon Share otherwise issuable the Merger Consideration as determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit 2.3(d) whereby any cash component of the Merger Consideration (including cash payable upon exercise of the Put Option) shall be substituted by a number of Novartis Shares based on the Novartis Share Valu
e, pursuant to Exhibit 2.3(d). The Alcon Board shall make all necessary adjustments to the Awards to accomplish the foregoing.

 





e)  


No Special Benefits to Directors and Members of Senior Management




 

Save as otherwise provided herein, Alcon represents that other than (i) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (ii) as approved by the Alcon Board prior to the date hereof, neither any member of the Alcon Board nor any member of senior management of Alcon has been awarded any compensation or benefits since December 31, 2009.

 

Alcon represents that no member of the Alcon Board, nor any member of senior management, has received any actual or contingent compensation or benefits, the vesting or payment of which is contingent upon the Merger, or any severance payments in the event of a termination of employment at any time following Completion other than the vesting terms in the 2009 and 2010 Award agreements under the Incentive Plan and the 2011 Award agreements under the Incentive Plan to be entered into with respect to Awards for the performance year 2010 and the severance terms set out in individual employment agreements as set forth in a schedule delivered to Novartis on the date hereof.

Alcon represents that, other than as set forth in section 2.3(d) (Equity Awards Granted under Alcon Incentive Plan), no compensation or benefits shall become payable to any current or former director or employee of Alcon as a result of Completion other than the vesting terms in the 2009 and 2010 Award agreements under the Incentive Plan and the 2011 Award agreements under the Incentive Plan to be entered into with respect to Awards for the performance year 2010 and the severance terms set out in individual employment agreements as set forth in a schedule delivered to Novartis on the date hereof.

The Novartis Shares issued to Alcon Shareholders in the Merger shall receive any future dividends paid by Novartis on the same basis as the Novartis Shares currently outstanding (other than with respect to dividends with an Ex-Dividend Date that is prior to Completion).

At the opening of the first Trading Day following the approval by the Swiss Federal Commercial Registry Office (EHRA) of the entry in the journal (Tagesregistereintrag) of the Merger, trading in the shares of Alcon on the New York Stock Exchange shall be discontinued.
