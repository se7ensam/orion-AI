    Tel Aviv,
Israel – August 2, 2010 - Bezeq - The Israel Telecommunication Corp., Limited
(TASE: BEZQ), Israel’s leading telecommunications provider, announced that on
August 2, 2010, its board of directors resolved that Bezeq will implement the
internal control provisions pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX")
in such a manner that will enable its controlling shareholder B Communications
Ltd. to satisfy the internal control and disclosure requirements that apply to
it under U.S. law.  The implementation of SOX requires internal audits
by Bezeq and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as well as the
engagement of an accounting firm and external consultants, including the
implementation by the auditors of the rules and guidelines of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board.
    
    The Reasons for Approving
the Action:
    
    Bezeq is
a material subsidiary of B Communications Ltd. Bezeq's compliance with SOX
regulations is required by law for the purpose of B Communications’ compliance
with the disclosure and internal control requirements that apply to it as a
company whose shares are traded in the United States. The implementation of SOX
by Bezeq will broaden the scope of Bezeq’s internal controls and will improve
its oversight of the accuracy of the information presented in its reports, all
of which shall benefit Bezeq.
