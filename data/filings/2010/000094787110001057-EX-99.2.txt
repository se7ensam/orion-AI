                Advantest Corporation (the “Company”)
and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “Advantest”) prepares its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).  U.S. GAAP is codified in the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), which is the source of
authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by
nongovernmental entities.
                Advantest prepared the accompanying
interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP,
consistent in all material respects with those applied in Advantest’s Annual
Report on Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2010.
                The interim financial statements are
unaudited, but reflect all normal adjustments that are, in the opinion of
management, necessary to provide a fair presentation of results for the interim
periods presented.  This interim information should be read with the
consolidated financial statements in Advantest’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for
the year ended March 31, 2010.

                The Company became listed on the New
York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2001 (local time) by means of an issuance
of American Depository Shares, and has been filing a Form 20-F (equivalent to
the Annual Securities Report in Japan) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission since the year ended March 31, 2002.  Advantest prepares
the consolidated financial statements in its Form 20-F in accordance with U.S.
GAAP.

                          Significant
      differences from the preparation of financial statements under Japanese
      GAAP
                        
                      
                
                
                Of the accounting principles,
procedures and method of presentation adopted by Advantest, the following is a
brief summary description of the significant differences from the preparation of
financial statements using the accounting principles, procedures and methods of
presentation under Japanese GAAP, as required under the Financial Instruments
and Exchange Law of Japan:
                
                (i) 
Allowance for compensated absences
                An
allowance is provided for the right of employees to receive compensated absences
in the future.
                
                (ii) 
Accrued pension and severance costs
                The
funded status, which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and
the projected benefit obligation, of pension plans is recognized in the
consolidated balance sheets.
                
                (iii) 
Goodwill
                Goodwill

              In October 2009, the FASB amended the
accounting guidance for revenue recognition under multiple-deliverable
arrangements.  The guidance modifies the criteria for separating
deliverables and allocating consideration in multiple-deliverable
arrangements.  The allocation of revenue is based on estimated selling
price if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of
selling price is available.  The guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption
permitted.  The guidance is required to be adopted by Advantest in the
first quarter beginning April 1, 2011.  Advantest is currently
evaluating the timing and the effect that this adoption will have on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
              
              In October 2009, the FASB amended
accounting guidance for software revenue recognition.  This guidance
changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible
products and software elements.  It provides guidance on how to
determine which software, if any, relating to the tangible product would be
excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance.  The
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with
early adoption permitted.  The guidance is required to be adopted by
Advantest in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2011.  Advantest is
currently evaluating
the timing and the effect that this adoption will have on its consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.

              Equity
securities consist primarily of stocks issues by Japanese listed
companies.  Debt securities are redeemable at the option of Advantest,
and have no contractual maturity.
              
              No
proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities and no gross gains and
losses were realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities for the six
months and three months ended September 30, 2009.  Proceeds from the
sale of available-for-sale securities and gross realized gains on the sale of
available-for-sale securities for the six months and three months ended
September 30, 2010 were insignificant.  No gross losses were realized
on the sale of available-for-sale securities.
              
              Net
realized gains and losses of the sale of available-for-sale securities are based
on the averaged cost method and are included in “other income (expense)” in the
consolidated statements of operations, and “other” in net cash provided by (used
in) operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash
flows.
              
              There
were no impairment losses on available-for-sale securities, which were not
considered other-than-temporarily impaired, for the six months and three months
ended September 30, 2009.  For the six months and three months ended
September 30, 2010, Advantest recognized impairment losses of ¥377 million and
¥371 million on available-for-sale securities, which were considered
other-than-temporarily impaired and wrote them down to the fair
value.

              Advantest
maintains non-marketable equity securities, which are recorded at
cost.  The carrying amounts of non-marketable equity securities were
¥3,389 million and ¥3,434 million at September 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010,
respectively.  For non-marketable equity securities which Advantest
identified events or changes in circumstances that might have had significant
adverse effect on the fair value of the investments, the fair value approximates
the carrying value.  Advantest has not estimated the fair value of
other non-marketable equity securities of ¥1,433 million and ¥1,417 million at
September 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively, since it is not practicable
to estimate the fair value of the investments.  It is because of the
lack of readily determinable fair values and difficulty in estimating fair value
without incurring excessive cost.

              Derivative
              Advantest
uses foreign exchange forward contracts and currency options to manage currency
exposure, resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, on trade
receivables.  However, these contracts do not qualify for hedge
accounting since they do not meet the hedging criteria specified in U.S.
GAAP.
              
              Foreign
exchange contracts generally have terms of several months.  These
contracts are used to reduce Advantest’s risk associated with exchange rate
fluctuations, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset
exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures.  Changes in fair
value of
foreign exchange contracts are recognized in earnings under the caption of other
income (expense).

              Concentration of credit
risk
              Derivative
financial instruments contain an element of risk in the event the counterparties
are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.  However, Advantest
minimizes risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to major international
banks and financial institutions meeting established credit
guidelines.  Management of Advantest does not expect any counterparty
to default on its obligations and, therefore, does not expect to incur any
losses due to counterparty default on its obligations.
              
              Advantest
generally does not require or place collateral for these derivative financial
instruments.

Fair Value Measurement
               
              Disclosure about the fair
value of Financial Instruments
              
              The
following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of
Advantest’s financial instruments at September 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010,
except for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables,
other current assets, trade accounts payable and accrued expenses for which fair
value approximate their carrying amounts.  Fair value estimates are
made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and
information about the financial instruments.  These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.  Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

              The
following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each
class of financial instruments:
              
              Cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, trade receivables, other current assets, trade accounts
payable and accrued expenses:  The carrying amounts approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
              
              Available-for-sale
securities:  The fair values of available-for-sale equity
securities are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those
investments.  The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities
are based on unobservable inputs as the market for the assets was not active at
the measurement date.
              
              Foreign exchange
contracts:  The fair value of foreign exchange contracts are
estimated by obtaining quotes from financial institutions.
              
              Fair Value
Hierarchy
              
              US GAAP
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.  Additionally the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value are prioritized into the
following three levels:
              
              Level 1 - Quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
              Level 2 - Observable inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
              Level 3 - Unobservable inputs
for the asset or liability.

              The table
does not include assets and liabilities which are measured at historical cost or
any basis other than fair value. Advantest’s financial assets and liabilities
measured at fair value consist of available-for-sale debt and equity securities
and foreign exchange contracts. Adjustments to fair value of available-for-sale
debt and equity securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of tax,
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) except where losses are
considered to be other than temporary, in which case the losses are recorded in
impairment losses on investment securities. Changes in fair value of foreign
exchange contracts are recognized in earnings under the caption of other income
(expense).
              
              Changes
in the Level 3 financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis
for the six months and three months ended September 30, 2010 are as
follows:

 Income Taxes
              As of
September 30, 2009, the estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2009 differs
from the 40.5 percent statutory income tax rate primarily due to the estimated
net increases in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the effects of
foreign tax rates.
              As of
September 30, 2010, the estimated annual effective tax rate for FY2010 differs
from the 40.4 percent statutory income tax rate primarily due to effects of
separate company income tax reporting positions and related impacts of valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets, and effects of foreign income tax
rates.

Accrued Warranty Expenses
               
              Advantest’s
products are generally subject to warranty, and Advantest provides an allowance
for such estimated costs when product revenue is recognized. To provide for
future repairs during warranty periods, estimated repair expenses over the
warranty period are accrued based on the historical ratio of actual repair
expenses to corresponding sales, and any facts and circumstances that
occurred.
              
              Changes
in accrued warranty expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2009 and
2010 were summarized as follows:
