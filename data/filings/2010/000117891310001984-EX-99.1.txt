Dividend Announcement




The Company’s Board of Directors today recommended the distribution of a cash dividend to shareholders totaling NIS 1.28 billion, or approximately NIS 0.48 per share.  The dividend, which is subject to shareholder approval, would be payable on October 7, 2010 to shareholders of record as of September 20, 2010.

Segment Highlights








  


§


Bezeq Fixed-Line: The Fixed-Line segment achieved an impressive EBITDA margin of 51.6% as growth in broadband Internet, data and transmission services almost completely offset the continued decline in revenues from traditional telephony. Q2 2010 Fixed-Line revenues of NIS 1.31 billion declined only 0.8% compared to Q2 2009. Q2 2010 operating profit increased 15.9% to NIS 503 million as EBITDA increased to NIS 674 million, up 5.5% versus Q2 2009. Bezeq continued the rollout of its advanced fiber optic, all IP-based NGN infrastructure, which as of quarter-end connected over 30% of Israeli households. Q2 2010 broadband Internet average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 8.7% year-over-year to NIS 75, as the broadband Internet subscriber base increased 3.4% year-over-year to 1.05 million subscribers. Operating and free cash flow grew 28.2% and 96.1% year-over-ye
ar to NIS 523 million and NIS 502 million, respectively, primarily due to timing differences in working capital and increased dividends from subsidiaries, respectively.




 





  


§


Pelephone: The cellular operations segment's Q2 2010 revenue set a record NIS 1.43 billion, up 6.2% versus Q2 2009, driven by increased usage of data, content, value-added services (VAS) and roaming services, associated primarily with the continued subscriber migration to the High-Speed GSM (HSPA) cellular network. Solid continued top line revenue growth drove double-digit year-over-year improvements in Pelephone’s operating profit, net profit and operating cash flow, as free cash flow more than doubled. EBITDA increased 8.3% to NIS 511 million (35.7% EBITDA margin). Active subscribers totaled approximately 2.81 million as of June 30, 2010, an increase of 4.2% year-over-year, and a net addition of 18,000 subscribers sequentially. Pelephone's quarter-end subscriber base included an Israeli industry high of 1.70 million 3G subscribers, of which approxim
ately 1.01 million were HSPA subscribers, representing approximately 36% of Pelephone's total subscriber base. As of today, the HSPA subscriber base totals approximately 1.05 million. Pelephone's ARPU increased 3.8% year-over-year to NIS 136 as HSPA subscribers registered higher revenues from data, content, VAS and roaming. As a result, data as a percentage of cellular service revenue hit a record 23.0%, versus 19.1% for Q2 2009.




 





  


§



Bezeq International: Israel's leading supplier of broadband ISP services' Q2 2010 results reflect the positive impact of a NIS 57 million one-time profit related to the consolidation of Walla! as of April 25, 2010. Excluding the impact from this consolidation, revenues reached NIS 342 million, up 4.7% versus Q2 2009; operating and net profit registered 1.9% and 8.6% declines to NIS 66 million and NIS 51 million, respectively; and EBITDA increased 2.0% to NIS 90 million for an EBITDA margin of 26.3% (27.0% EBITDA margin for Q2 2009). Segment cash flow metrics registered year-over-year declines primarily as a result of increased segment working capital needs.

§


yes:3 Revenues for Q2 2010 increased 5.3% year-over-year to NIS 396 million driven by a 2.0% year-over-year increase in total subscribers to 573,000, higher sales of value-added content services such as yes Max, yes MaxHD, new IP-based video-on-demand yes MaxTOTAL, as well as increased content sales. Q2 2010 results include the negative impact of a significant provision in relation to royalties claimed by ACUM, a non-profit organization which administers proprietary music rights, since 2003. Including the impact of this provision, Q2 2010 operating profit declined to NIS 7 million from NIS 59 million in Q2 2009, the net loss increased to NIS 143 million from NIS 95 million in Q2 2009, while EBITDA decreased to NIS 75 million from NIS 115 million a year ago. Segment operating cash flow increased 1
7.1% to NIS 109 million, and free cash flow expanded to NIS 46 million, up 38.6% versus Q2 2009.




 

Management Review




Shlomo Rodav, Chairman of the Board of Bezeq, stated, “Excellent execution across the group allowed Bezeq to post increased revenue, as well as double-digit growth in operating profit, net profit to shareholders, and EBITDA. These performance gains were supported by record Pelephone cellular revenue, increased levels of sales of broadband Internet, data communications and transmission services in the Fixed-Line segment, as well as solid growth within Bezeq International and the yes premium pay-TV segment. Growth areas such as Internet access, data and transmission services almost completely offset fixed-line telephony revenue erosion in our Fixed-Line business.




“The strategic investments we have made in terms of leading edge IP and cellular infrastructures uniquely position Bezeq to successfully deliver converged next generation communications solutions, strengthening our market position in the competitive Israeli communications landscape as well as providing enhanced flexibility to navigate an evolving regulatory environment. As we head into the third quarter of 2010, historically our seasonally strongest quarter of the year, we remain focused on driving additional operational and financial leverage from our NGN and HSPA network infrastructures. With about 36% of Pelephone subscribers on the HSPA network and Bezeq Fixed-Line’s NGN now connecting over 30% of Israeli households, there are opportunities for additional long-term revenue and profitability growth as we extend our posit
ion as Israeli’s leading supplier of comprehensive consumer and business communications solutions,” concluded Mr. Rodav.




Alan Gelman, Chief Financial Officer and Deputy CEO of Bezeq, commented, “Increased cash flow generation during the quarter reflects the reversal of timing differences in working capital changes from the previous quarter, and further confirms our ability to continue rewarding shareholders through active cash dividend remuneration. The recommended distribution of NIS 1.28 billion in cash to our shareholders announced today reaffirms Bezeq’s commitment to creating shareholder value.”

 






3 Following the deconsolidation of yes from the Bezeq Group financial results as of August 21st, 2009, and pursuant to accepted IFRS accounting practices, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2009 do not consolidate yes’ financial results. yes’ results from January 1st through August 20, 2009, are accounted for as results from discontinued operations.

Bezeq Group revenues for Q2 2010 totaled NIS 2.98 billion, up 3.8% from NIS 2.87 billion for Q2 2009. Consolidated revenue growth was driven by solid business expansion at Pelephone and Bezeq International, and was partially offset by a 0.8% decline in Bezeq Fixed-Line. Within the Fixed-Line segment, continued growth in high-speed Internet, data communications and transmission services almost completely compensated for the decline in revenue associated with traditional fixed-line telephony.




Operating profit for the Company increased 21.0% to NIS 990 million in Q2 2010, up from NIS 818 million in Q2 2009. The second quarter improvement in operating profit delivered an impressive 33.2% operating margin and was driven primarily by higher total revenues and the positive impact of ongoing cost reduction initiatives, as well as by a NIS 57 million one-time gain related to the consolidation of Walla!.




Net profit attributable to Bezeq shareholders for Q2 2010 amounted to NIS 638 million, up 17.9% from NIS 541 million for Q2 2009. Diluted earnings per share totaled NIS 0.24 versus NIS 0.20 for Q2 2009.




The Company’s EBITDA for Q2 2010 totaled NIS 1.34 billion, up 12.0% as compared to NIS 1.20 billion for Q2 2009. The consolidated EBITDA margin reached 44.9%, versus 41.6% for Q2 2009.




Cash flow from operating activities in Q2 2010 rose 36.6% year-over-year to NIS 976 million, as compared to NIS 715 million in Q2 2009. The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was primarily related to timing differences in working capital, primarily within Bezeq Fixed-Line.

 Press Release

 



 

Gross capital expenditures in Q2 2010 amounted to NIS 427 million, an increase of 7.0% as compared to Q2 2009. This rise was primarily related to the ongoing rollout of the Fixed-Line segment’s nationwide NGN infrastructure. The Q2 2010 consolidated capex-to-sales ratio was 14.3%, as compared with 13.9% in Q2 2009.




Free cash flow increased 73.4% year-over-year to NIS 606 million in Q2 2010, as compared with NIS 350 million in Q2 2009.




As of June 30, 2010, the Company’s consolidated financial debt was NIS 5.23 billion, compared with NIS 4.17 billion as of June 30, 2009 (excluding yes’ debt to financial institutions). The increase in the financial debt was primarily related to Bezeq raising debt totaling NIS 1.5 billion during Q2 2010 through new loans from Israeli banks with an average duration of 4.6 years. As of the end of Q2 2010, the Company’s net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.07 as compared to 0.76 at the end of Q2 2009.

Bezeq Fixed-Line’s successful ongoing rollout of its all IP-based NGN nationwide infrastructure continued to drive growth in high-speed Internet access, data communications and transmission services, which offset the continued decline in traditional fixed-line telephony revenues. The NGN enhances Bezeq’s technological preparedness to compete in an increasingly converged communications market, and reaffirms Bezeq’s position as Israel’s leading provider of innovative communications offerings.

 Press Release

 




 

As of June 30, 2010, Bezeq Fixed-Line had connected over 30% of Israeli households to the new network. Bezeq’s goal is to expand NGN coverage to 50% of Israeli households by year-end 2010 and reach about 80% of households by 2012. Beyond providing a superior customer experience, the NGN provides an important platform upon which Bezeq is developing and deploying new value-added services, aimed at delivering an enhanced customer experience, increasing operating efficiencies and improving future segment profitability.




Bezeq Fixed-Line successfully mitigated the anticipated decline in revenues during Q2 2010 to only 0.8% versus Q2 2009. Q2 2010 results benefited from record levels of revenues from high-speed Internet (ADSL), data communications and transmission services, which almost completely offset the decrease in voice revenues resulting from fewer lines, lower call traffic, and slightly lower interconnect fees.




Bezeq Fixed-Line’s operating profit for Q2 2010 increased 15.9% to NIS 503 million, up from NIS 434 million in Q2 2009. This improvement came as a result of the continued rationalization of the cost structure, as total operating costs declined 9.0% year-over-year to NIS 804 million. Lower costs in Q2 2010 were a result of 16.6%, 5.3% and 3.6% year-over-year reductions in depreciation and amortization, salary expense as well as operating and general expenses, respectively.




The ongoing successful implementation of cost efficiency measures across the Fixed-Line segment resulted in Q2 2010 EBITDA rising 5.5% year-over-year to NIS 674 million, for a 51.6% EBITDA margin, as compared to 48.5% in Q2 2009.




The number of customers subscribing to Bezeq's ADSL Internet access service increased 3.4% year-over-year to approximately 1.05 million subscribers as of June 30, 2010, reaffirming Bezeq Fixed-Line as the leader in broadband access services in Israel. The successful rollout of the NGN infrastructure across the country drives the continued upgrade of Bezeq's broadband Internet subscriber base, as the average bandwidth increased 42% year-over-year to 3.4 megabits per second (Mbps) as of quarter-end. Furthermore, Bezeq already has over 100,000 subscribers benefiting from NGN bandwidths of 10 Mbps and beyond.




ADSL average revenue per user (ARPU) for Q2 2010 increased 8.7% year-over-year to NIS 75.  Sustained historically high levels of ADSL APRU are primarily due to bandwidth upgrades, sales of value-added services, as well as continued leadership in home network deployments. Fixed-line telephony average revenue per line for Q2 2010 was NIS 81, unchanged from the year ago period.




Bezeq Fixed-Line's Q2 2010 cash flow from operating activities increased 28.2% year-over-year to NIS 523 million, primarily due to timing differences related to payments to suppliers and the previously announced advanced salary and bonus payment to Fixed-Line employees in late March instead of early April due to the timing of the Passover holidays.




Gross capital expenditures for Q2 2010 reached NIS 269 million, up 28.7% over Q2 2009, representing a quarterly capex-to-sales ratio of 20.6%, as compared to 15.9% for Q2 2009. The aforementioned increases reflect higher levels of capital expenditures related to the ongoing deployment of the NGN network.




Free cash flow generated by the Fixed-Line segment for Q2 2010 totaled NIS 502 million, up 96.1% from NIS 256 million for Q2 2009, primarily as a result of increased dividends from subsidiaries in the 2010 quarter, as well as from the aforementioned improvement in operating cash flow.

Pelephone, Bezeq’s cellular segment, delivered record revenue, net profit and EBITDA driven by the ongoing successful ramp of its High-Speed GSM (HSPA) network. Pelephone continues to see clear evidence that the migration of customers to the new HSPA network is driving higher subscriber levels, as well as material growth in cellular data and roaming services.




Pelephone’s active subscribers totaled approximately 2.81 million as of June 30, 2010, an increase of 0.6% sequentially (18,000 net subscriber additions) and a 4.2% increase versus the year ago period (113,000 net subscriber additions). 3G subscribers totaled 1.70 million subscribers as of June 30, 2010, an increase of 4.9% sequentially and an increase of 29.9% year-over-year. The new HSPA network, which is central to Pelephone’s commitment to access higher value segments of the mobile communications market, had approximately 1.01 million subscribers as of June 30, 2010, accounting for about 36% of Pelephone’s total subscriber base. As of today, the HSPA subscriber base has further increased to approximately 1.05 million.




Q2 2010 revenues increased 6.2% to a record NIS 1.43 billion versus Q2 2009, driven primarily by increased usage of data, content, VAS and roaming, all of which contributed to ARPU growth. Revenues from cellular services for Q2 2010 reached NIS 1.14 billion and grew 8.6% year-over-year, sustaining the growth rate of the previous quarter. Revenues from handset sales declined 2.4% year-over-year, however grew 0.7% sequentially. The second quarter of 2009, which was the first full reporting period following the launch of the HSPA network, included the positive impact of extraordinarily high levels of handsets sales associated with the HSPA network launch.




Revenues from data, content and VAS constituted a record 23.0% of Pelephone’s revenues from cellular services for Q2 2010, compared to 19.1% for Q2 2009 and 22.6% for Q1 2010. As Pelephone continues leading the cellular data market, during the second quarter it upgraded its network to support data bandwidths of up to 21 Mbps (downstream) and up to 5.6 Mbps (upstream), making its HSPA network the fastest and most advanced in Israel.




Pelephone’s ARPU for Q2 2010 increased 3.8% year-over-year to NIS 136 versus NIS 131 for Q2 2009. Average minutes of use (MOU) for Q2 2010 increased 5.8% year-over-year to 348 minutes.

 Press Release

 



 

Net profit for Pelephone increased to a record NIS 267 million in Q2 2010, up 14.6% year-over-year. Net profit benefited mainly from higher revenues and increased levels of data, content, VAS and roaming services. These gains were mitigated by increased costs associated with the operation of the new HSPA network alongside the existing CDMA cellular network.




In Q2 2010 Pelephone generated record EBITDA of NIS 511 million (35.7% EBITDA margin), an increase of 8.3% compared to Q2 2009 (35.1% EBITDA margin).




Pelephone’s cash flow from operating activities for Q2 2010 totaled NIS 378 million, an increase of 30.3% compared to Q2 2009, primarily due to higher profitability and working capital improvements, the effect of which was partially offset by higher tax payments. Free cash flow for Q2 2010 more than doubled year-over-year to NIS 264 million, as the increase in operating cash flow was combined with substantially lower capital expenditures-related payments as compared to Q2 2009, following the successful deployment of the HSPA cellular infrastructure early in 2009. Pelephone's capex-to-sales ratio for Q2 2010 was 7.8%, as compared to 9.4% both for Q2 and for the full-year 2009.

Bezeq International, Israel's leading provider of broadband ISP services, completed during the second quarter of 2010 the previously announced acquisition of an additional 32.6% stake in Walla!, one of Israel's leading Internet portals serving a community of more than 5 million monthly users in Israel and abroad, for approximately NIS 89 million. As a result of the increase in ownership, Bezeq International began consolidating Walla! as of April 25, 2010, and pursuant to accepted IFRS accounting practices, this consolidation resulted in a one-time profit of NIS 57 million.




Bezeq International’s successful penetration of the enterprise market through the offering of ICT solutions, combined with the continued leadership and investment in the broadband ISP segment, are generating growth in the company’s core businesses. Excluding Walla!'s contribution to quarterly revenues, Bezeq International’s Q2 2010 revenues grew 4.7% year-over-year to NIS 342 million, as a result of higher sales of Internet services, including an increase in the number of broadband subscribers, alongside rapid growth in the field of ICT solutions.

 Press Release

 






Bezeq International generated a net profit of NIS 105 million in Q2 2010, which includes the positive impact of the Walla!-related one-time NIS 57 million gain. Excluding this one-time gain, Bezeq International's net profit declined to NIS 51 million from NIS 56 million in Q2 2009, mainly as a result of lower operating costs in the 2009 quarter, and higher financing expenses in the 2010 period in relation to a loan borrowed from Bezeq for the acquisition of the additional Walla! shares.




Bezeq International’s Q2 2010 EBITDA, excluding the positive impact of the Walla! related one-time profit, totaled NIS 90 million (26.3% EBITDA margin), as compared to NIS 88 million for Q2 2009 (27.0% EBITDA margin).




Q2 2010 cash flow from operating activities decreased to NIS 66 million, down 20.4% versus Q2 2009, mainly due to increased working capital requirements during the quarter. Q2 2010 free cash flow declined 46.3% versus Q2 2009 to NIS 33 million, due to the decline in operating cash flow, an increase in capital expenditure, and the absence of dividends from Walla! in Q2 2010 as compared to the receipt of a NIS 5 million dividend in Q2 2009.

As previously announced, the yes multi-channel pay-TV business ceased to be consolidated into the Bezeq Group’s financial statements as of August 21, 2009. As a result, and pursuant to accepted IFRS accounting practices, the Bezeq Group accounts for its investment in yes using the equity method at the fair value of its investment in yes from that date.




yes' Q2 2010 revenue increased 5.3% to a record NIS 396 million compared to Q2 2009. The rise in revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of total subscribers, increased sales of advanced paid services such as yes Max, yes MaxHD, the recently launched VOD service yes MaxTOTAL, as well as increased sales of content.




Total yes subscribers increased 2.0% year-over-year to 573,000 subscribers as of June 30, 2010, up 11,000 subscribers from the year ago period and up 2,000 subscribers sequentially. Q2 2010 segment ARPU experienced a 3.1% year-over-year rise to NIS 231.

 Press Release

 



 

yes' Q2 2010 results include a one-time provision relating to royalties claimed by ACUM, a non-profit organization which administers proprietary music rights, since 2003. As a result of this provision, yes’ Q2 2010 operating profit declined to NIS 7 million versus NIS 59 million for Q2 2009, while the net loss increased 50.1% year-over-year to NIS 143 million. Q2 2010 EBITDA was NIS 75 million (19.1% EBITDA margin), as compared to NIS 115 million for Q2 2009 (30.5% EBITDA margin). The decline in segment profitability year-over-year was due to the impact of the ACUM provision despite increased subscriber levels, improved ARPU and the positive impact of ongoing efficiency measures.




yes' cash flow metrics once again delivered a strong performance in Q2 2010 with cash flow from operating activities rising 17.1% year-over-year to NIS 109 million, and free cash flow increasing 38.6% to NIS 46 million from NIS 33 million in Q2 2009. Improvements in segment cash flow were primarily attributable to improvements in accounts receivable and payable.

 

2010 Outlook




The Bezeq Group reiterates its full-year guidance, projecting 2010 revenues, net profit from continuing operations and EBITDA to be in line or slightly higher than 2009 levels. This forecast is underpinned by the strength of the Bezeq Group’s comprehensive consumer and business communications offerings and a strict focus on improving operating efficiencies.




The Bezeq Group continues to expect gross capital expenditures in 2010 to be close to the 2009 level and will mainly reflect continuing investment in Bezeq’s Next Generation Network (NGN), expanding its coverage to reach approximately 50% of Israeli households by the end of 2010, and slightly lower capital expenditures at Pelephone, which successfully completed and launched its High-Speed GSM (HSPA) network in early 2009.

 

The aforementioned guidance for the full-year 2010 is based on the anticipated Bezeq Group consolidated financial performance, which following the deconsolidation of yes financials as of August 21, 2009, excludes the financial contribution of yes from both the 2009 and 2010 full-year periods.
