NEWS RELEASE TRANSMITTED BY MARKETWIRE

FOR: AGRIUM INC.

TSX, NYSE SYMBOL: AGU

February 9, 2010

Agrium Reports Fourth Quarter Results; Well Positioned for 2010

CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - Feb. 9, 2010) -

ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$

Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today net earnings of $30-million
($0.19 diluted earnings per share) for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with
the net earnings of $124-million in the fourth quarter of 2008 ($0.79 diluted
earnings per share). On an annual basis, 2009 net earnings were $366-million
($2.33 diluted earnings per share) as compared to net earnings of $1.3-billion
($8.34 diluted earnings per share) in 2008.

The 2009 fourth quarter results included losses of $35-million ($0.17 diluted
earnings per share) on gas and other hedge positions and a $34-million expense
($0.17 diluted earnings per share) in stock-based compensation. Net earnings
calculated on the same basis as our fourth quarter guidance would have been
$84-million ($0.53 diluted earnings per share) for the fourth quarter of 2009,
compared to our guidance range for the quarter of $0.14 to $0.44 diluted
earnings per share.(1)

"The fourth quarter of 2009 saw the initial stages of recovery in the crop input
sector. We have seen increasing demand for domestic potash and a tight supply
situation for nitrogen and phosphate products. Wholesale sales volumes were
substantially higher this quarter across all products than the fourth quarter of
last year, despite the shortened fall application season." said Mike Wilson,
Agrium President and CEO.

"We are seeing increasing signs that demand for crop nutrients and other crop
inputs will be strong in the coming spring, despite some recent weakening in
crop prices following the revised yield estimates from the USDA. Agrium is
looking forward to a significant recovery in the crop input markets in 2010."

KEY RESULTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2009 contributed
$904-million, compared to $671-million in the prior year. Furthermore, our
net-debt to net-debt plus equity continued to decline in the fourth quarter,
reaching 16 percent compared to 26 percent at the end of the third quarter of
2009. A $25-million tax recovery in the fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily due
to the higher than expected proportion of income earned in lower taxed
jurisdictions and a loss incurred in a higher taxed (U.S.) jurisdiction.

Agrium acquired 57 farm centers in the United States and Canada over the past
several months. The combined annual sales for these acquisitions, including a
limited number of independent U.S. outlets obtained earlier in 2009, is
projected at approximately $350-million and the combined purchase price was
approximately $100-million, including working capital.

Wholesale sales volumes increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2009
compared to 2008, as both grower and retailer demand rebounded from last year,
even with the shortened application window this fall. Wholesale sales volumes in
the fourth quarter of 2009 were 35 percent, 69 percent, and 25 percent higher
than the same period last year for nitrogen, phosphate, and potash,
respectively.

In December 2009, Agrium announced that Egyptian Nitrogen Products Company
S.A.E. ("ENPC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of MISR Fertilizer Production Company
S.A.E. ("MOPCO"), had secured $1.05-billion of non-recourse project financing
from a syndicate of Egyptian and regional banks. This will allow ENPC to proceed
with tripling of the existing MOPCO nitrogen facility in Damietta, Egypt by 2012
(1), bringing Agrium's 26 percent equity interest in production from 176,000
tonnes to 546,000 tonnes of production. Under the financing plan, Agrium will
not be required to put any further equity into the project. Agrium reported
equity earnings of $6-million for its interest in MOPCO in the fourth quarter of
2009, bringing total equity earnings for 2009 to $20-million.

Agrium continues to be fully committed to acquiring CF Industries, Inc. ("CF"),
and intends to continue to press the board of directors of CF to engage in
negotiations with Agrium to execute a mutually beneficial merger agreement for
our respective shareholders. On January 14, 2010, Agrium notified CF that Agrium
will nominate two independent and highly qualified directors for election to
CF's board of directors at CF's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders.

2009 Fourth Quarter Operating Results

NET EARNINGS

Agrium's fourth quarter consolidated net earnings were $30-million, or $0.19
diluted earnings per share, compared with net earnings of $124-million, or $0.79
diluted earnings per share, for the same quarter of 2008. Net earnings before
interest expense and income taxes ("EBIT") were $31-million for the fourth
quarter of 2009 compared with EBIT of $172-million for the fourth quarter of
2008. A reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings is provided in the section
"Non-GAAP Measures". Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2009 was
$383-million, a $139-million decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.
The decreases in quarter-over-quarter gross profit and EBIT were primarily
driven by lower selling prices for our products, partially offset by an increase
in sales volumes and lower cost of production. For discussion on the performance
of each business unit, see section "Business Segment Performance".

Expenses were $47-million lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the
same period last year largely due to a combination of the following items:

<PAGE>

- -    an $87-million write-down in our EAgrium investment in the fourth quarter
     of 2008 (net to Agrium of $45-million after elimination of non-controlling
     interests);

- -    a $41-million reduction in potash profit taxes; and,

- -    a $22-million reduction in selling expenses.

     this press release.

These favorable changes were partially offset by a $95-million change in other
expenses as outlined in the table below:

and 2008:

</TABLE>

/T/

The tax recovery in the fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily due to the higher
than expected proportion of income earned in lower taxed jurisdictions and a
loss incurred in higher taxed (U.S.) jurisdiction. The effective tax rate was 22
percent for 2009, compared with 31 percent for 2008. The lower annual tax rate
was due to a higher proportion of income earned in lower taxed jurisdictions in
2009, partially offset by Canadian income tax on the foreign exchange gains
related to our U.S. dollar-denominated debt.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE

Retail

Retail's 2009 fourth quarter net sales were $738-million, compared to
$1.0-billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $189-million in the
fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $228-million for the same period last year.
Retail EBIT was a loss of $57-million in the fourth quarter of 2009, versus a
loss of $54-million in the fourth quarter of 2008.(1)

Crop nutrient net sales were $431-million this quarter compared to $631-million
in the same quarter last year. Lower crop nutrient prices for the

<PAGE>

primary nutrients more than offset an increase in sales volumes this quarter
compared to the same period last year. While crop nutrient sales volumes were
above last year's levels, they were still 20 percent below expected volumes due
to the shortened fall application season. Gross profit for crop nutrients was
$46-million this quarter compared to the fourth quarter results of $60-million
achieved in 2008. This quarter over quarter variance in gross profit also
reflects a $93-million write-down in nutrient inventory valuation in the fourth
quarter of 2008. Crop nutrient margins averaged 11 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2009, slightly higher than the third quarter of 2009 and slightly higher than
the fourth quarter of 2008 including the write-down. The reduction in gross
profit compared to last year was due to the decline in overall crop nutrient
prices, both from the fourth quarter of 2008 and during 2009, therefore reducing
the realizable margin, while the shortened fall application season limited the
typically higher margin, full-service ammonia market. We anticipate crop
nutrient margins to improve significantly in 2010 as demand is expected to be
strong and inventory costs are below current replacement costs.(2) Sales volumes
at our South American operations were also higher this quarter when compared to
the same period last year as rain has returned to the region, ending the worst
drought in approximately 100 years. Gross profit from our South American retail
operations was $10-million this quarter, compared to $7-million last year which
included an $8-million write-down in inventory in the fourth quarter of 2008.

/T/

(1)  In the second quarter of 2009, a forward-looking statement indicated that
     2009 Retail EBITDA was expected to be approximately $400-million, the
     realized EBITDA was $266-million with the reduction primarily related to
     lower than expected crop nutrient margins and sales volumes in the fall
     season.

(2)  See disclosure in the section "Outlook, Key Risks and Uncertainties" in
     this press release.

/T/

Crop protection net sales were $234-million in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 19
percent decrease from the $288-million in sales for the same period last year.
This was mainly due to lower sales prices for glyphosate, which was partially
offset by an 83 percent increase in glyphosate volumes this quarter compared to
the same period last year. Gross profit this quarter was $98-million, a decrease
of $35-million over last year's $133-million, due primarily to timing
differences in the recognition of volume rebates. On an annual basis, 2009
rebates exceeded 2008. Crop protection product margins as a percentage of net
sales were 42 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared to 46 percent
in the same period last year.

Net sales for seed, services and other decreased by 29 percent to $73-million
this quarter, from $103-million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross profit was
$45-million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $35-million for the same
period last year. Seed sales were $16-million in the fourth quarter of 2009, a
decrease of 65 percent over the same period last year due primarily to less
wheat acres being planted.

Gross profit from seed sales was $16-million this quarter compared to $7-million
in the fourth quarter of 2008, due to timing of seed rebates recognition this
year. Application services revenues were $32-million and gross profit was
$24-million this quarter, both marginally higher than

<PAGE>

results from the same period last year. The relative strength in earnings from
this product line in a difficult agricultural environment illustrates the
benefits of the diversity in our Retail business.

Retail selling expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $211-million, a 13
percent decline over last year's level, primarily due to reduced fuel and
maintenance costs and to lower salaries and performance incentives earned.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 was
29 percent, up significantly from the 24 percent in the same period last year.
The 51 percent decrease in nutrient unit prices compared to the prior period was
the primary contributor to the higher expense as a percent of sales.

Wholesale

Wholesale's net sales were $716-million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared
to $982-million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross profit was $180-million in
the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with the $283-million in the fourth quarter
for 2008, due primarily to lower average sales prices across all three
nutrients. The resulting reduction in quarter over quarter selling prices more
than offset a 44 percent increase in sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2009
when compared to the same period last year. The key factor driving the higher
volumes during the quarter was a return to stronger demand from North American
customers for all three nutrients, despite the shortened application season this
fall. Cost of product sold for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $237 per tonne,
$209 per tonne lower than the same quarter in 2008 due primarily to lower
natural gas costs on nitrogen and $121-million of inventory write-downs in the
fourth quarter of 2008. EBIT of $140-million in the fourth quarter of 2009 was
$34-million higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to lower potash
profit taxes and derivative losses. Prior year EBIT was also impacted by a
$45-million impairment, after non-controlling interest, of our former investment
in EAgrium.

Nitrogen gross profit was $95-million this quarter, compared to $136-million in
the same quarter last year. Benchmark prices and Agrium's realized prices were
lower than last year across all nitrogen products. Domestic and international
ammonia and urea volumes were up significantly in the fourth quarter of 2009
compared to the same period last year. Nitrogen cost of product sold was $214
per tonne this quarter, significantly lower than the $317 per tonne in the
fourth quarter of 2008. The lower production cost was primarily a result of
lower North American gas prices. Agrium's nitrogen margins averaged $102 per
tonne this quarter, compared with $197 per tonne in the fourth quarter of last
year.

Agrium's overall natural gas cost was $4.82/MMBtu (including gas hedging) in the
fourth quarter of 2009 versus $7.41/MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2008. The
U.S. benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the fourth quarter of 2009 was
$4.27/MMBtu, versus $6.82/MMBtu in the same quarter last year and $3.41/MMBtu in
the third quarter of 2009. The AECO (Alberta) basis narrowed to $0.28/MMBtu in
the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $0.98/MMBtu in same period of 2008.

Potash gross profit was $74-million ($210 per tonne) in the fourth quarter of
2009 versus $159-million ($562 per tonne) in the fourth quarter of 2008. The
average realized sales price was $382 per tonne this quarter, down from $678 per
tonne for the same period last year. Sales volumes were 353,000 tonnes,

<PAGE>
an increase of 25 percent from the same period last year. Domestic demand was up
81 percent compared to the same period last year; while international sales
remained significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 due to continued
uncertainty in international markets given the negotiations for a new supply
contract with China were not complete. Cost of product sold on a per tonne basis
was $172 per tonne or $56 per tonne higher than for the same quarter last year,
partly due to the stronger Canadian dollar and lower operating rates at our
Vanscoy facility.

Phosphate gross profit was $1-million this quarter, compared to $86-million in
the same quarter last year. Realized sales prices averaged $392 per tonne, down
$725 per tonne when compared to the record $1,117 per tonne price achieved in
the same quarter last year. Sales volume this quarter was 232,000 tonnes,
representing a 69 percent increase as compared to the same quarter in 2008.
Phosphate cost of product sold was $388 per tonne or $101 per tonne lower than
the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower ammonia and sulphur costs.
The phosphate market experienced improvement in benchmark prices in the fourth
quarter from the previous quarter in 2009. When compared to the third quarter of
this year, average realized sales prices for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $24
per tonne higher and benchmark prices have continued to climb into 2010.

Gross profit for the Purchase for Resale business in the fourth quarter of 2009
was $2-million versus a loss of $108-million for the same period last year. The
majority of the variance was due to an inventory write-down of $121-million
taken in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Wholesale expenses were $137-million lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 than
the same period last year. This was primarily due to a $45-million impairment
(after non-controlling interest) booked in the fourth quarter of 2008 of our
former investment in EAgrium and a $51-million reduction in hedging losses on
our natural gas, power and foreign exchange derivatives. The remainder of
reduction in expenses was due to lower potash profit taxes in the fourth quarter
of 2009 primarily as a result of lower quarter-over-quarter margins.

Advanced Technologies

Advanced Technologies' fourth quarter 2009 net sales were $95-million compared
to $76-million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily
attributed to the inclusion of the new turf and ornamental business that was
transferred from Retail to Advanced Technologies in 2009. Although ESN sales
volumes were up 88 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same
period in 2008, net sales were impacted by lower average realized sales prices
in ESN and other controlled release products versus the fourth quarter of 2008,
as a result of a decline in the price of urea.

Gross profit for Advanced Technologies was $16-million for the quarter, compared
with $17-million for the same period last year. EBITDA was $8-million lower this
quarter versus the comparable period in 2008 due to lower average realized sales
prices and margins for products sold and higher selling, general and
administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative costs for Advanced
Technologies were $10-million higher in the fourth quarter of 2009 than the same
period last year due primarily to the relocation of the segment's corporate
offices to Loveland, Colorado and the inclusion of costs related to the new turf
and ornamental operations transferred from Retail.

<PAGE>

Other

EBIT for our other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2009
was a loss of $46-million, a decrease of $160-million compared with earnings of
$114-million for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease reflected the absence
of foreign exchange gains which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, and an
increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by an increase in our share
price in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with a decrease in the comparative
period of 2008.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities was $904-million in the fourth quarter of
2009, compared with $671-million in the same period of 2008. This $233-million
increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to:

- -    a $69-million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense; and,

- -    a $610-million increase in non-cash working capital.

The increase in non-cash working capital is primarily driven by the increase in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by the change in
accounts receivable.

The favorable cash inflow provided by operating activities were partially offset
by:

- -    a $94-million decrease in net earnings;

- -    lower non-cash inventory and purchase commitment write-downs, and,

- -    a $180-million non-cash decrease in the net future income tax liabilities.

Cash used in investing activities increased by $48-million due to higher capital
expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2009. Capital expenditures for 2009 were
$313-million compared with our forecast previously disclosed in our third
quarter MD&A(1), as we chose to defer several projects and initiatives into 2010
to conserve cash while we have an outstanding offer for CF Industries Holdings,
Inc.

Cash used in financing activities was $24-million in the fourth quarter of 2009

pay-down of our bank indebtedness and long-term debt, and funds used for shares
repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently,
quarter-to-quarter results are not directly comparable. Sales are concentrated
in the spring and fall planting seasons, while produced inventories are
accumulated throughout the year. Cash collections generally occur after the
planting seasons in North and South America.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

In the discussion of our performance for the quarter, in addition to the primary
measures of earnings and earnings per share, we make reference to EBIT (net
earnings before interest expense and income taxes) and EBITDA (net earnings
before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment). We consider EBIT and EBITDA to be useful measures of performance
because income tax jurisdictions and business segments are not synonymous and we
believe that allocation of income tax charges distorts the comparability of
historical performance for the different business segments. Similarly, financing
and related interest charges cannot be allocated to all business units on a
basis that is meaningful for comparison with other companies.

EBIT and EBITDA are not recognized measures under GAAP, and our methods of
calculation may not be comparable to other companies. Similarly, EBITDA should
not be used as an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating activities
as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBIT to net earnings as
calculated in accordance with GAAP:

OUTLOOK, KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Grain and oilseed prices increased through the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by
the latest U.S. corn harvest on record, positive global economic momentum and
weakness in the U.S. dollar. Grain and oilseed futures prices declined somewhat
in early January in response to higher than expected U.S. corn yield and
production estimates released by the USDA. Despite historically strong
production, record global demand for grains and oilseeds and overall improvement
in the global economy has maintained grain and oilseed prices above historical
averages.

This strength in grain and oilseed prices has continued to support crop input
expenditures. Looking to 2010, we see continued improvement in the seed market
due to the trend in adoption of new seed varieties, and a stronger crop
protection market compared to last year due to increased usage of glyphosates,
crop health products and increased weed resistance resulting in expanded use of
alternative crop protection products.

North American demand was hampered in the fall application season due to a
delayed U.S. harvest, which analysts anticipate will lead to greater demand for
all three nutrients in the first half of 2010. In addition, record corn yields
in the U.S. in the 2009 growing season means a large draw on soil reserves,
which will need to be replenished in the upcoming year.

Between the start and end of the fourth quarter, benchmark U.S. Gulf urea prices
increased 20 percent. U.S. demand began to show strength in December, after a
delayed harvest. Most analysts expect U.S. nitrogen demand to continue to be
strong in the first half of 2010 due to a combination of a slow fall season and
forecasts of increased corn area. The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) reported that
December 2009 urea inventories in North America were 42 percent below December
2008 levels and 9 percent below the five-year average. An additional factor
supporting the nitrogen market is anticipated increases in the formula-based
natural gas prices paid by Ukrainian nitrogen producers. Currently, Ukrainian
nitrogen producers are paying a significantly

<PAGE>

lower price than the prevailing formula price at the Russia/Ukraine border but
this is expected to change after the first quarter of 2010.

Phosphate fundamentals improved significantly in the second half of 2009, but
the market was slow to react to a tighter supply and demand balance which
contributed to increased volatility in the last month of the year. Phosphate
prices increased by over 30 percent between mid-November and the end of
December, as the market was ignited by Chinese import purchases, which was
followed by improved demand from many destinations. Going forward, the supply
situation appears tight heading into the spring. U.S. December DAP and MAP
inventories were reported by TFI to be 38 percent below five-year average levels
and 60 percent below December 2008. Phosphate production is also running at a
significantly higher rate on a global scale, resulting in increased demand and
pricing for raw materials such as sulphur and ammonia. Non-integrated producer
costs have increased as a result of higher input costs, including higher
phosphate rock and phosphoric acid costs. Going forward, analysts expect India
and Latin America to import more phosphate in 2010 versus 2009.

Demand in the potash market showed significant signs of recovery at the
beginning of 2010. Analysts report that there is considerable pent-up demand in
the potash market as importers have been waiting for a Chinese potash contract
to be agreed upon. North American purchases for spring applications increased in
late December, and demand continued early in 2010. In addition, Brazilian potash
inventories are reportedly tight and import demand is expected to rebound. India
imported large volumes of potash in late 2009 but there is uncertainty on the
timing of new 2010 purchases due to changes in global potash prices. In
addition, the timing and impact of changes in Indian fertilizer subsidies to a
proposed Nutrient Based Subsidy is an uncertainty in the potash and phosphate
markets.
