<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><B>CALGARY, ALBERTA - Alberta Star Development Corp. (TSXV:ASX) (&#147;Alberta Star&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) </B>announces that it has completed and placed on production its previously announced well located at C11-6-50-25 W3M (&#147;C-11&#148;) (NR October 15 ,2010). The initial production rates from the newly completed C-11 test well, have met or exceeded initial production flow expectations. The Company will control the well production, at approximately 80 bbls/d in accordance with established good oil field practices. The C-11 well is offsetting the Company&#146;s producing C12-6-50-25 W3M (&#147;C-12&#148;) well, which is situated in Landrose, Saskatchewan. The C-12 well is currently producing at 80 bbls/d gross of heavy oil (4 bbls/d net before payout and 20 bbls/d net after payout). Combined production flow from the C-11 and C-12 wells is approximately 160 bbls/d gross of heavy oil (8 bbls/d net before payout and 38 bbls/d net after payout to Alberta Star. All p
roduction from the C-11 well is from the McLaren formation.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In addition, the Company has completed drilling and casing of the heavy oil well situated at C14-6-50-25 W3M (&#147;C-14&#148;) in Landrose, Saskatchewan. The C-14 well is expected to be completed and in production in the next few days. The C-14 is also being completed in the Mclaren formation. Initial Oil shows from the C-14 test well location, which also tests the McLaren formation, have been extremely encouraging.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Alberta Star holds a 50% working interest in the C-11 and C-14 wells which form part of the heavy oil assets acquired by Alberta Star on August 6, 2010 from Western Plains Petroleum Ltd. (&#147;Western Plains&#148;). Arctic Hunter Uranium Inc. (&#147;Arctic Hunter&#148;) under a (Participation Agreement (NR October 15, 2010) has agreed to pay 100% of Alberta Star&#146;s share of the cost to drill, complete and equip or abandon the s C-11 and C-14 wells to earn a 100% (50% net) interest before payout, reserving to Alberta Star a convertible overriding royalty of 10% until payout. After payout, Alberta Star has the option to convert the gross overriding royalty to a 50% working interest (25% net) in the C-11 and C-14 well spacing units or remain in a gross overriding royalty position. Western Plains is the operator of the C-11 and C-14 wells.</P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The calculation of barrels of oil equivalent (&#147;boe&#148;) are based on a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet (&#147;mcf&#148;) of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil. Boe&#146;s may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl is base on energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</P>
