                     NOTICE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING
                      OF SHAREHOLDERS ON FEBRUARY 16, 2010

The Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") of Acergy S.A.
(the "Company"), a Societe Anonyme Holding R.C.S. Luxembourg B 43172 having its
Registered Office at 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg, will be held at the
offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg, on Tuesday February
16, 2010 at 12.00 p.m. (local time).

Resolution 1 for consideration at the Meeting was first to be considered at the
Extraordinary General Meeting on December 17, 2009. The required quorum of 50%
of the outstanding shares for resolution 1 was not present and the Extraordinary
General Meeting was therefore not able to consider this resolution. The Board of
Directors has therefore decided to call the Meeting to consider resolution 1. At
this Meeting, there is no requirement for quorum. However, to approve the
proposed resolution a 2/3rd majority of the votes cast will be required. The
Meeting will therefore be held for the following purpose:

(1)  To approve the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company to
     adopt amended Articles of Incorporation as summarised in the attached
     Chairman's letter.

The Company's Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favour of the
proposal to be considered at the Meeting.

The Meeting shall be conducted in conformity with the voting requirements of
Luxembourg Company Law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation, no quorum
applying at this second Extraordinary General Meeting.
