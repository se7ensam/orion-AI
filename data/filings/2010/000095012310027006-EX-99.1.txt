and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to: if advertisers or the viewing public do not accept, or lose interest in,
our air travel advertising network, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our
operating activities and our prospects and results of operations could be negatively affected; we
derive substantially all of our revenues from the provision of air travel advertising services, and
recent slowdown in the air travel advertising industry in China may materially and adversely affect
our revenues and results of operation; our strategy of expanding our advertising network by
expanding into traditional media and building new media platforms may not succeed, and our failure
to do so could materially reduce the attractiveness of our network and harm our business,
reputation and results of operations; if our customers reduce their advertising spending due to an
economic downturn in China and/or elsewhere or for any other reason, our revenues and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected; we face risks related to health epidemics such
as the H1N1 flu, which could materially and adversely affect air travel and result in reduced
demand for our advertising services or disrupt our operations; if we are unable to retain existing
concession rights contracts or obtain new concession rights contracts on commercially advantageous
terms that allow us to operate our advertising platforms, we may be unable to maintain or expand
our network coverage and our business and prospects may be harmed; a significant portion of our
revenues has been derived from the five largest airports and three largest airlines in China, and
if any of these airports or airlines experiences a material business disruption, our ability to
generate revenues and our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected; our
limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of
operations; and other risks outlined in AirMedia’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. AirMedia does not undertake any obligation to
update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.
