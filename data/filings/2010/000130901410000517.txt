<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-size: 11pt"><B>51job, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results</B></FONT>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>SHANGHAI, China, August&nbsp;5, 2010 </B>&#150; <B>51job, Inc. (Nasdaq: JOBS)</B>, a leading provider of integrated
human resource services in China, announced today unaudited financial results for the second
quarter of 2010 ended June&nbsp;30, 2010.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Second Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights:</B>
<BR>
&#150; Total revenues increased 35.7% over Q2 2009 to RMB262.4&nbsp;million (US$38.7&nbsp;million), exceeding the
Company&#146;s guidance range of RMB250&nbsp;million to RMB260&nbsp;million
<BR>
&#150; Online recruitment services revenues increased 74.0% over Q2 2009 to RMB134.6&nbsp;million (US$19.9
million)
<BR>
&#150; Gross margin expanded to 68.0% compared with 59.8% in Q2 2009
<BR>
&#150; Operating income increased to RMB64.5&nbsp;million (US$9.5&nbsp;million) compared with RMB26.8&nbsp;million in
Q2 2009
<BR>
&#150; Fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB0.97 (US$0.29 per ADS)
<BR>
&#150; Excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation loss as well as
their related tax impact, non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per common share were RMB1.11
(US$0.33 per ADS), exceeding the Company&#146;s guidance range of RMB0.95 to RMB1.05
<BR>
&#150; Cash and short-term investments increased to RMB1,409.7&nbsp;million (US$207.9&nbsp;million) as of June
30, 2010


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, Inc., said,
&#147;We continued to observe a recovery trend in the Chinese recruitment market during the second
quarter. Our online business achieved record revenues as we successfully grew our client base,
adding employers from existing cities and new geographies. Although we increased sales and
customer service headcount as well as marketing activities in light of improved market conditions,
we reached new highs in gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter by leveraging the
powerful scale economies and operating efficiency of our business model. We remain focused on
executing our strategic plan, delivering tangible results to our clients and increasing value for
our shareholders.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Second Quarter 2010 Unaudited Financial Results</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Total revenues for the second quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 were RMB262.4&nbsp;million (US$38.7&nbsp;million),
an increase of 35.7% from RMB193.3&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Print advertising revenues for the second quarter of 2010 increased 6.8% to RMB71.7&nbsp;million
(US$10.6&nbsp;million) compared with RMB67.2&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009. The increase was
primarily due to improved market demand and higher average revenue per page which was partially
offset by a decrease in the number of print advertising pages. Although print advertising prices
in each city were largely unchanged, overall average revenue per page increased 18.1% over the
second quarter of 2009 as a result of an increase in page volume contribution from higher priced
cities as compared to the same quarter of the prior year. However, mainly due to the decrease in
the number of cities where <I>51job Weekly </I>is published, from 22 cities as of June&nbsp;30, 2009 to 17
cities as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, the estimated number of print advertising pages generated in the second
quarter of 2010 decreased 9.5% to 2,587 compared with 2,860 pages in the same quarter in 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Online recruitment services revenues for the second quarter of 2010 were RMB134.6&nbsp;million (US$19.9
million), representing a 74.0% increase from RMB77.4&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The increase primarily resulted from a greater number of unique employers using the
Company&#146;s online recruitment services. Unique employers increased 73.2% to 137,111 in the second
quarter of 2010 compared with 79,151 in the same quarter of the prior year driven by greater
customer acceptance and usage of online recruitment services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Other human resource related revenues for the second quarter of 2010 increased 14.9% to RMB56.0
million (US$8.3&nbsp;million) from RMB48.7&nbsp;million in the same quarter of 2009 primarily due to greater
market demand for our business process outsourcing, executive search and training services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Gross profit for the second quarter of 2010 increased 54.3% to RMB169.0&nbsp;million (US$24.9&nbsp;million)
from RMB109.6&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is gross profit
as a percentage of net revenues, expanded to 68.0% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with
59.8% in the same quarter in 2009 primarily due to greater economies of scale, improved efficiency
and a decrease in printing-related expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were RMB104.6&nbsp;million (US$15.4&nbsp;million) compared
with RMB82.8&nbsp;million for the same quarter of 2009. Sales and marketing expenses for the second
quarter of 2010 increased 41.3% to RMB68.5&nbsp;million (US$10.1&nbsp;million) from RMB48.5&nbsp;million for the
same quarter of the prior year primarily due to an increase in salaries and commissions resulting
from higher sales and headcount additions as well as greater advertising and promotion expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2010 increased 5.1% to RMB36.1
million (US$5.3&nbsp;million) from RMB34.3&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2009 primarily due to higher
employee compensation expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Income from operations for the second quarter of 2010 increased to RMB64.5&nbsp;million (US$9.5&nbsp;million)
from RMB26.8&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. Operating margin, which is income
from operations as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 25.9% in the second quarter of 2010
compared with 14.6% in the same quarter of 2009. The reduction in the effective tax rate to 23.0%
in the second quarter of 2010 from 32.7% in the second quarter of 2009 was primarily due to the
qualification of an operating entity as a High and New Technology Enterprise in December&nbsp;2009,
which is subject to a preferential tax rate of 15%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Net income for the second quarter of 2010 increased to RMB54.3&nbsp;million (US$8.0&nbsp;million) from
RMB20.8&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2009. Fully diluted earnings per common share for the
second quarter of 2010 were RMB0.97 (US$0.14) compared with RMB0.37 for the same quarter in 2009.
Fully diluted earnings per ADS for the second quarter of 2010 were RMB1.95 (US$0.29) compared with
RMB0.74 in the second quarter of 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">In the second quarter of 2010, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of
RMB6.5&nbsp;million (US$1.0&nbsp;million) compared with RMB6.8&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2009. The
Company also recognized a foreign currency translation loss of RMB1.0&nbsp;million (US$0.2&nbsp;million) in
the second quarter of 2010 compared with RMB0.1&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2009 due to an

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of income before
income tax expense, income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share and
adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude share-based
compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss as well as their related tax
impact. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense and its related tax impact
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company&#146;s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company&#146;s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss and its related tax impact
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation
gain or loss is not indicative of the Company&#146;s core business operations and will not result in
cash settlement nor impact the Company&#146;s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP
measures excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss
and their related tax impact are important in helping investors to understand the Company&#146;s current
financial performance and future prospects and to compare business trends among different reporting
periods on a consistent basis. The presentation of these additional measures should not be
considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported
or forecasted by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in
the attached financial statements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Statements in this release regarding targets for the third quarter of 2010, future business and
operating results constitute &#147;forward-looking&#148; statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon management&#146;s current expectations, and actual
results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are
the number of recruitment advertisements placed, sales orders received and customer contracts
executed during the remaining weeks of the third quarter of 2010; any accounting adjustments that
may occur during the quarterly close; fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S.
dollar and other currencies; behavioral and operational changes of customers in meeting their human
resource needs as they respond to evolving social, economic and political changes in China as well
as stock market volatilities; introduction by its competitors of new or enhanced products or
services; price competition in the market for the various human resource services that the Company
provides in China; acceptance of new products and services developed or introduced by the Company
outside of the human resources industry and fluctuations in general economic conditions. For
