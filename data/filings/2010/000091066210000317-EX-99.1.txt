    Tel Aviv,
Israel – July 28, 2010 – Bezeq - The Israel Telecommunication Corp., Ltd. (TASE:
BEZQ), Israel’s leading telecommunications provider, announced that on July 28,
2010, it was served with a lawsuit and a motion to certify the lawsuit as a
class action that were filed in the Tel Aviv District Court.
     
    The
plaintiff claims that as a result of a failure of Bezeq’s phone service (which
was not repaired by Bezeq for 34 hours), Bezeq's  subscribers were not
able to phone or connect to  subscribers of Hot Telecom L.P ("HOT"),
which caused damages to Bezeq’s subscribers.  The plaintiff is seeking
compensation in the amount of NIS 100 per subscriber.  The total
amount of the claim is estimated by the plaintiff at NIS 250 million ($66
million).
     
     
    The
plaintiff is seeking certification of the lawsuit as a class action on behalf of
Bezeq’s subscribers. It is noted that in 2006, Bezeq was served with a lawsuit
and a motion to certify the lawsuit as a class action by HOT’s subscribers with
respect to the same matter. Such claim was settled in 2009, as reported in
Bezeq’s 2009 annual report (section 2.18.8).
     
    Bezeq is
reviewing and assessing the lawsuit and at this stage, is not able to evaluate
the probability of success of the lawsuit.
