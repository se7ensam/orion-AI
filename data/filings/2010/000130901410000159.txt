<!-- PAGEBREAK -->

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, Inc., said,
&#147;In light of the challenges we faced and overcame in 2009, we were especially pleased to end the
year on a high note by achieving record profit in the fourth quarter. We have observed a
strengthening trend in market conditions and believe our online business in particular has carried
solid momentum into 2010. In addition, with the opening of our new call center in Wuhan, this
business is well positioned to not only extend our geographic reach and addressable employer base,
but also streamline our service network for greater efficiency and margin expansion. We believe
the year is off to a robust start for 51job.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Fourth Quarter 2009 Unaudited Financial Results</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Total revenues for the fourth quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 were RMB226.0&nbsp;million (US$33.1
million), an increase of 15.2% from RMB196.2&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Print advertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 8.2% to RMB64.6&nbsp;million (US$9.5
million) compared with RMB59.7&nbsp;million for the same quarter in 2008. The increase was primarily
due to higher average revenue per page, which was partially offset by a lower volume of print
advertising pages in <I>51job Weekly </I>resulting from a decline in market demand. Although print
advertising prices in each city remained relatively unchanged, overall average revenue per page
increased 39.8% over the fourth quarter of 2008 due to an increase in page volume contribution from
cities where print advertising prices are generally higher as compared to the same quarter of the
prior year. The estimated number of print advertising pages generated in the fourth quarter of
2009 decreased 22.6% to 2,672 compared with 3,452 pages in the same quarter in 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Online recruitment services revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 were RMB97.3&nbsp;million (US$14.2
million), representing a 33.7% increase from RMB72.7&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior
year. The increase primarily resulted from a greater number of unique employers using the
Company&#146;s online recruitment services, which was partially offset by lower average revenue per
unique employer. Unique employers increased 66.4% to 94,993 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared
with 57,071 in the same quarter of the prior year driven by greater customer acceptance and usage
of online recruitment services. Average revenue per unique employer decreased 19.7% in the fourth
quarter of 2009 due to employers purchasing lower priced products and/or reducing their overall
spending on online services as compared to the same quarter in 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Other human resource related revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 0.5% to RMB64.1
million (US$9.4&nbsp;million) from RMB63.8&nbsp;million in the same quarter of 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 42.1% to RMB134.3&nbsp;million (US$19.7&nbsp;million)
from RMB94.5&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is equal to gross
profit divided by net revenues, expanded to 62.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 51.0%
in the same quarter in 2008 primarily due to lower printing related and other direct expenses
resulting from the implementation of cost control and efficiency measures in 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 were RMB92.5&nbsp;million (US$13.6&nbsp;million) compared
with RMB88.6&nbsp;million for the same quarter of 2008. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues decreased to 43.2% for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 47.8% for the fourth
quarter of 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 8.4% to RMB63.1&nbsp;million
(US$9.2&nbsp;million) from RMB58.2&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to
increased commissions resulting from higher sales, which were partially offset by lower travel and
entertainment expenses as compared to the same quarter in 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 3.2% to RMB29.4
million (US$4.3&nbsp;million) from RMB30.4&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower
office expenses and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher rental and
depreciation expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased to RMB41.7&nbsp;million (US$6.1&nbsp;million)
from RMB5.9&nbsp;million for the same quarter of the prior year. During the fourth quarter of 2009, one
of the Company&#146;s main subsidiaries received notification from relevant tax authorities that it had
qualified as a High Technology Enterprise under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, which
reduced its tax rate for 2009 from 20% to 15% in Shanghai and from 25% to 15% in other localities.
The cumulative impact of this tax change resulted in an effective tax rate of 1.0% in the fourth
quarter of 2009.

for 2008.

(US$0.73) compared with RMB4.29 in 2008.

program authorizing the repurchase of up to US$25&nbsp;million worth of outstanding ADSs. In the fourth

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), 51job uses non-GAAP measures of adjusted net
income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted earnings per ADS, which are adjusted from
results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and foreign
currency translation gain or loss. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense
from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and
analyze the Company&#146;s core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the
underlying performance of the Company&#146;s business operations and do not impact its cash earnings.
The Company believes excluding foreign currency translation gain or loss from its non-GAAP
financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation gain or loss is
unrelated to the Company&#146;s core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor
impact the Company&#146;s cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP measures excluding
share-based compensation expense and foreign currency translation gain or loss are important in
helping investors to understand the Company&#146;s current financial performance and future prospects
and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The
presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to
GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The
non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Statements in this release regarding targets for the first quarter of 2010, future business and
operating results constitute &#147;forward-looking&#148; statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the Private Securities Litigation

results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are
the number of recruitment advertisements placed, sales orders received and customer contracts

may occur during the quarterly close; fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S.
dollar and other currencies; behavioral and operational changes of customers in meeting their human
resource needs as they respond to evolving social, economic and political changes in China as well
as stock market volatilities; introduction by its competitors of new or enhanced products or
