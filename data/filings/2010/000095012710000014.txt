The Board of Directors therefore decided to call an Extraordinary General
Meeting to consider resolution 1. At this Meeting there is no requirement for
quorum. However, to approve the proposed resolution a 2/3rd majority of the
votes cast at the Meeting will be required.

Dear Shareholder,

An Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") of Acergy S.A.
(the "Company") will be held on Tuesday February 16, 2010 at 12.00 p.m. (local
time) at the offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg.

Due to the fact that the Company is incorporated in Luxembourg as a Societe
Anonyme Holding, the Company's affairs are governed by the provisions of
Luxembourg Company Law. Under these provisions and the provisions of the
Company's Articles of Incorporation, an Extraordinary General Meeting relates to
and considers matters of a formal nature. The matters to be addressed at the
Meeting are restricted to those in the attached Notice.

It was noted at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on December
17, 2009 that the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares for
resolution 1 was not present and that meeting was therefore not able to consider
that resolution.

The Board of Directors has therefore decided to call the Meeting to consider
resolution 1. At this Meeting there is no requirement for quorum. However, to
approve the proposed resolution a 2/3rd majority of the votes cast at the
Meeting will be required.

In relation to this resolution, our letter of November 10, 2009 provided some
clarity as follows:

"Resolution 1: Adoption of amended Articles of Incorporation

The Directors propose the adoption of amended Articles of Incorporation. Key
proposed changes to the Articles are summarised below:

Article        Change
- ------------   -----------------------------------------------------------------
3              Changes in Luxembourg law mean that, as from 31 December 2010,
               the Company (either by statute or by Board decision) will no
               longer be subject to the requirements of the 1929 Luxembourg
               holding company law. A transitional provision is introduced to
               allow for this.

8              The Board's power, previously contained in Article 8, to restrict
(para 3)       transfers of shares in certain jurisdictions has been removed.

25             Extraordinary General Meetings can be called by shareholders
               representing one-tenth, rather than one-fifth as previously, of
               the issued share capital. This is in line with changes in
               Luxembourg law.

                                                        [GRAPHIC OMITTED] Acergy

Article        Change
- ------------   -----------------------------------------------------------------
27             The previous Article 27, which authorised the Board to close the
               shareholder register for up to 60 days preceding a shareholder
               meeting, dividend payment, allotment of rights, or share
               conversion or exchange, has been deleted. The Board retains the
               right to set a record date for such events.

33(a)          The restriction, previously contained in Article 33(a), on a
               shareholder holding more than 20% of the outstanding share
               capital without Board approval, has been removed.

33(a)          The Board's power to restrict or prevent ownership of shares
               where it believes that such ownership may result in "Imminent and
               Grave Danger" to the Company has been removed from Article 33(a).

33(c)(ii)      The mechanism for determining the price to be paid on a
               compulsory repurchase of shares (Article 33(c)(ii)) has been
               modified.

36             The new Article 36 delegates authority to the Board to make
               changes in line with the implementation into Luxembourg law of
               the European Directive on minority shareholdings.

The effect of the above changes is primarily to modify some Articles to reflect
changes in legislation and to remove restrictions which currently apply to
shareholdings, and which are not in conformity with current law or practice. The
removal of these restrictions is, we believe, in shareholders' interests.

Further changes have been made to improve the clarity of the Articles. The full
text of the proposed new Articles can be found on our website, at:
www.acergy-group.com/public/February2010EGM and can also be obtained from the
Company Secretary, Acergy S.A., 412F, route d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg."

Proxies already received for the December 17, 2009 Extraordinary General Meeting
remain valid for this Meeting and shareholders of record as of Friday October
30, 2009 are entitled to vote at the Meeting. Those Shareholders who have not
yet cast their votes may do so by submitting the enclosed Proxy Card as
instructed, or alternatively attend the Meeting in Luxembourg at the above
address. The new deadline for submission of votes for American Depositary
Receipt holders is February 8, 2010 and for holders of Common Shares February 9,
2010.

Enclosed with this mailing is the Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders and the Proxy Card.

If you wish your shares to be voted at the Meeting, please promptly sign, date
and return the enclosed Proxy Card to ensure that it will be received in time.

                                                                     Page 2 of 3

                     NOTICE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING
                      OF SHAREHOLDERS ON FEBRUARY 16, 2010

The Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") of Acergy S.A.

Resolution 1 for consideration at the Meeting was first to be considered at the
Extraordinary General Meeting on December 17, 2009. The required quorum of 50%
of the outstanding shares for resolution 1 was not present and the Extraordinary
General Meeting was therefore not able to consider this resolution. The Board of
Directors has therefore decided to call the Meeting to consider resolution 1. At
this Meeting, there is no requirement for quorum. However, to approve the
proposed resolution a 2/3rd majority of the votes cast will be required. The
Meeting will therefore be held for the following purpose:

(1)  To approve the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company to
     adopt amended Articles of Incorporation as summarised in the attached
     Chairman's letter.

The Company's Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favour of the
proposal to be considered at the Meeting.

The Meeting shall be conducted in conformity with the voting requirements of
Luxembourg Company Law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation, no quorum
applying at this second Extraordinary General Meeting.

Shareholders of Acergy S.A.

Issue:               Acergy S.A. / Cusip 00443E104

Country:             Luxembourg

Meeting Details:     Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders -
                     February 16, 2010 at the offices of SGG S.A., 412F, route
                     d'Esch, L-2086 Luxembourg. 12:00 PM Local Time.

                     including the Agenda, is enclosed

Voting Deadline:     On or before February 8, 2010 at 10:00 AM (New York City
                     time)

ADR Record Date:     October 30, 2009

Common: ADR ratio    1 Common Share: 1 ADR

In accordance with Section 17 of the Deposit Agreement between Acergy S.A. (the
"Company") and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Depositary (the
"Depositary"), Acergy S.A. ADR holders (the "Holders") are hereby notified of
the Company's Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. A copy of the
Notice of Meeting from the Company, which includes the agenda for such meeting,
is enclosed.

Holders at the close of business on the ADR record date will be entitled,
subject to applicable law, the Company's Articles of Incorporation and the
provisions of or governing Deposited Property underlying ADRs, to instruct the
Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any, pertaining to the
Shares or other Deposited Property represented by ADRs. A voting instruction
form is enclosed for that purpose.

It was noted by the Company at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders
on December 17, 2009 that the required quorum of 50% of the outstanding shares
for resolution 1 was not present and the Meeting was therefore not able to
consider this resolution. The Board of Directors of the Company therefore
decided to call a second Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to
consider resolution 1. At this Meeting there is no requirement for quorum.
However, to approve the proposed resolution a 2/3rd majority of votes cast at
the Meeting will be required.

Proxies already received for the initial meeting remain valid for this Meeting
and Holders at the close of business on the ADR record date will be entitled,
subject to any applicable law, the Company's Articles of Incorporation and the
provisions of or governing Deposited Property underlying ADRs, to instruct the
Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any, pertaining to the
Shares or other Deposited Property represented by ADRs. Those Holders who have
not previously issued a proxy for that purpose can use the enclosed voting
instruction form.

Upon receipt of a voting instruction from an ADR Holder on the ADR record date,
received on or before the ADR voting deadline, the Depositary shall endeavor,
insofar as practicable and permitted under applicable law, the provisions of the
Articles of Incorporation of the Company and the provisions of the Deposited
Property underlying the ADRs, to vote or cause the Custodian to vote the Shares
and/or other Deposited Property, in person or by proxy, represented by the ADRs
in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request.

Voting instructions may be given only in respect of a number of ADRs
representing an integral number of Shares or other Deposited Property.

Neither the Depositary nor the Custodian shall under any circumstances exercise
any discretion as to voting and neither the Depositary nor the Custodian shall
vote or attempt to exercise the right to vote Shares or other Deposited Property
represented by ADRs except pursuant to and in accordance with such written
instructions from Holders. Shares or other Deposited Property represented by
ADRs for which no specific voting instructions are received by the Depositary
from the Holder shall not be voted.

In the event of a postponement of the Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders, all votes received from beneficial Holders of Acergy S.A. ADRs
will remain valid for the purposes of any such postponed General Meeting.
