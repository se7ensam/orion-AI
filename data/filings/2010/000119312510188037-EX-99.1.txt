Statement of Alex Wynaendts, CEO 
“The significant increase in sales, underlying earnings and net income during the second quarter of this year demonstrate the continued strength of
AEGON’s business. Consistent with our focus on serving the growing need for long-term retirement security, pension sales were particularly strong in the Americas and the United Kingdom. Impairments in our investment portfolio continued their
downward trend, reaching their lowest level in two years and approaching our long-term assumptions. As a result of changes to S&P’s capital requirements for our businesses, AEGON’s excess capital declined, however, it continues to
provide what we consider a solid buffer. We are implementing a number of key measures, as announced in June, to sharpen our focus on our core activities and improve returns, particularly within our business in the United Kingdom. At the same time,
we are continuing to pursue our options for AEGON’s life reinsurance business, which include finding a suitable buyer for Transamerica Reinsurance. Furthermore, we expect soon to receive a final decision from the European Commission on the plan
we submitted to demonstrate AEGON’s long-term viability as part of the State support AEGON received at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. We will communicate that decision at the earliest opportunity. Going forward, we will maintain
our focus on better leveraging our broad resources, pursuing further operational improvements and putting AEGON’s proven expertise to work for our customers in all our markets.”

…resulting in sustainable, profitable growth. At the
Analyst & Investor Conference last June, CEO Alex Wynaendts announced new measures to focus more on key long-term growth opportunities in AEGON’s core activities and further improve returns from the company’s existing businesses.
Over the next five years, AEGON aims to become a leader in all of its chosen markets by being the most recommended life and pensions company by customers, the preferred partner for distributors and an employer of choice among current and prospective
employees.  Reallocate capital 
One of AEGON’s key strategic objectives is to focus on its core businesses of life insurance, pensions and asset management, and achieve a greater
geographical balance by reallocating capital to the growth markets of Central & Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. AEGON continues to assess its businesses to ensure they meet requirements in terms of earnings growth, cash flow
generation, return on capital and customer life cycle needs. As part of this review, AEGON announced in June that it would explore strategic options for Transamerica Reinsurance, the company’s life reinsurance business, including finding a
suitable buyer.  As part of efforts to further improve its risk profile, AEGON will also be increasing equity hedging of its back book of
variable annuities in the United States and continue to shift its focus to fee-based business from spread-based products.  Increase returns
 In the United Kingdom, AEGON is taking significant steps to improve the return on capital by targeting cost reductions of 25% in the
company’s life and pension operations and refocusing resources on the At Retirement and Workplace Savings markets where there is strong potential for growth and AEGON has leading positions. In addition, AEGON has withdrawn from the UK bulk
annuities market and is exploring strategic options for parts of its existing back books. Taken together, these measures are aimed at improving return on capital from AEGON’s UK business to 8%-10% and cumulative cash flows of GBP
600 million to 650 million by 2014.  AEGON aims to increase returns by delivering operational excellence in all of its businesses.
This will be achieved by further reducing costs while investing in core capabilities and improving service levels to ensure continued customer loyalty. 
In addition, AEGON is developing new products that are simpler, more transparent and offer customers better value. To deliver on this strategy, AEGON
will further invest in its global workforce. As part of this approach, the company has launched a global talent management program aimed at encouraging and developing talent among employees. Last month, AEGON announced the appointment of a new
global head of human resources, Carla Mahieu, who will work with business units to better leverage the top talent available throughout the organization. In addition, AEGON is rolling out an engagement plan for employees around the world and has
taken steps to bring target compensation for senior management further in line with the company’s overall strategic objectives.

 Optimize ONE AEGON 
Over the past two years, measures have been taken to manage AEGON more as one international company. AEGON is committed to making better use of its global
resources in managing its businesses, to standardize best practices and to introduce a single balance sheet approach to capital management. 
To meet these objectives, AEGON will implement and monitor new performance measurement standards across the company.

 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
Underlying earnings before tax 
AEGON’s underlying earnings before tax increased to EUR 522 million in the second quarter, a significant improvement compared with the same
period last year. This increase in earnings was due mainly to improved financial markets, strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and growth of the business, while last year’s earnings had also included several exceptional items.
 In the Americas, underlying earnings totaled EUR 437 million, a 51% increase compared with last year, primarily the result of higher
investment income, a recovery in equity markets and lower expenses.  Underlying earnings in the Netherlands came in strong at EUR 97 million.
However, earnings declined as the second quarter last year had included a one-time release in provisions of EUR 20 million. Results for the second quarter of 2010 were also affected by lower investment income and the sale of AEGON’s Dutch
funeral insurance business.  In the United Kingdom, underlying earnings increased slightly to EUR 22 million as higher profits from
annuities were partly offset by higher project-related expenses.  Underlying earnings from New Markets declined to EUR 40 million. The
inclusion of AEGON Asset Management was more than offset by lower results from Central & Eastern Europe and further investments in the company’s operations in Asia. 
Expenses for the holding company increased slightly in the second quarter of 2010 to EUR 74 million, primarily a result of higher funding costs.
 Fair value items  In the
second quarter, fair value items showed an overall performance of EUR 3 million.  Overperformance in the Netherlands was the result mainly of
gains in the fair value of guarantees and related hedges, partly offset by lower residential real estate values. In the Americas, underperformance was due primarily to a decline in results from credit derivatives and variable annuity guaranteed
minimum withdrawal benefits products, which offset gains from the company’s macro equity hedge.  AEGON has decided to set its short term
equity market return assumption in determining estimated gross profits on variable life and variable annuity products in the Americas at 9% for the second quarter, reflecting the continued volatility experienced in equity markets and the use of
macro equity hedges. This decision resulted in an additional charge of EUR 144 million, which has been included in fair value items, partly offsetting gains from the company’s macro equity hedge. 
In addition, a widening of AEGON’s own credit spread was more than offset by fair value movements of derivatives, which resulted in a loss for the
holding company.  Gains on investments 
In the second quarter, realized gains on investments increased to EUR 148 million. In both the United States and the Netherlands, gains were related
primarily to the sale of bonds as part of asset and liability management, while the gain of EUR 97 million in the holding was realized on investments related to excess capital. 
Impairment charges  Net impairments
continued their downward trend, amounting to EUR 77 million, reaching their lowest level in two years and approaching AEGON’s long-term assumptions. Impairments during the second quarter were primarily related to US housing related
securities.  Other charges 
Other charges amounted to EUR 60 million. These included a one-time provision of EUR 105 million for settlement of a dispute related to a Bank-Owned
Life Insurance (BOLI) policy in the United States. Subsequent to the disruption in the credit market, which affected the investment value of the policy’s underlying assets, a suit was filed alleging that the policy terms were not sufficiently
fulfilled by AEGON.

 This provision was partly offset by a book gain of EUR 33 million from the sale of AEGON’s
funeral insurance business in the Netherlands.  Run-off businesses 
AEGON’s run-off businesses in the Americas recorded a loss in the second quarter of EUR 49 million. This loss was lower than expected because of
better portfolio yields.  Income tax 
Tax charges in the second quarter amounted to EUR 74 million and included a EUR 26 million tax benefit related to cross-border intercompany
reinsurance transactions between the United States and Ireland.  Operating expenses 
Operating expenses increased 3% to EUR 841 million due to a strengthening of the US dollar and pound sterling against the euro. However, operating
expenses declined 2% at constant currencies as result of a number of initiatives to reduce expenses.  New life sales 
New life sales increased 22% compared with the second quarter of 2009 to EUR 590 million as almost all units experienced double-digit growth. The
main drivers behind the increase were pension sales in the United Kingdom and retail life sales in the Americas.  Deposits 
Gross deposits, excluding run-off businesses, rose 16% to EUR 7.6 billion. Primary drivers of the increase were third-party asset management, US pensions
and retail mutual fund inflows, offsetting lower fixed annuity deposits, which were managed lower. Net deposits totaled EUR 1 billion, excluding AEGON’s run-off businesses, as all units reported positive net deposits. 
Value of new business  AEGON’s
value of new business declined to EUR 148 million in the second quarter due to a decrease in the United Kingdom, following earlier repricing of immediate annuities and lower fixed annuity sales in the United States. In Spain, lower sales of
risk products also led to a lower value of new business.  In the second quarter, 22% of AEGON’s total value of new business came from New
Markets. The internal rate of return on new business remained strong at 18% in the second quarter.  Revenue-generating investments 
 Revenue-generating investments increased 5% compared with the end of the first quarter to EUR 409 billion, primarily as a result of a
strengthening in both the US dollar and the pound sterling against the euro.  Capital management 
At the end of the second quarter, AEGON’s core capital position, excluding revaluation reserves, amounted to EUR 18.6 billion,
equivalent to 74% of the company’s total capital base and above its target threshold of 70%. AEGON’s aim is to increase the proportion of core capital over time to
75%6. 
AEGON’s revaluation reserves at June 30, 2010, turned positive for the first time in almost three years and amounted to EUR 588 million. This
significant improvement is mainly the result of an increase in the value of fixed income securities.  Shareholders’ equity rose to EUR
17.2 billion as a result of the improved revaluation reserves, strengthening of the US dollar and the pound sterling against the euro, and the addition of second quarter net income. 
Excess capital above S&P’s AA capital adequacy requirements declined to EUR 3.0 billion, of which EUR 1.9 billion was held in operating units
and EUR 1.1 billion at the holding company. Positive contributions from earnings and capital preservation measures were more than offset by increased capital requirements for asset related risks. Standard & Poor’s revised their risk
factors, significantly increasing applied charges related primarily to bond portfolios. As a result, capital requirements in the Americas rose during the second quarter by USD 0.9 billion. 
At June 30, 2010, AEGON’s Insurance Group Directive (IGD) capital surplus totaled EUR 7 billion, equivalent to a solvency ratio of
approximately 200%.

 Over the past few months, AEGON has been engaged in the process of obtaining the European
Commission’s final consent to the terms relating to AEGON’s participation in the capital support program of the Dutch State. AEGON expects the European Commission to announce its final decision in the near future. 
Dividend  AEGON’s dividend policy
remains unchanged and is based on its capital position and cash flows. AEGON aims to maintain a sizeable cash buffer in order to fulfill its priority of repaying the Dutch State as soon as it is responsible and feasible to do so. AEGON will
therefore not declare an interim dividend to common shareholders in 2010.  Risk management 
In the second quarter, AEGON reduced its already limited exposure to peripheral European sovereign bonds, which amounted to a market value of EUR 1.5
billion at June 30, 2010. As part of this reduction, AEGON sold approximately EUR 450 million in Spanish government bonds during the quarter. 
Financial strength ratings  During the
second quarter, the financial strength ratings of AEGON’s US operating companies were upgraded by A.M. Best to A+ with a Stable outlook, reflecting A.M. Best’s assessment of the companies’ financial strength and support of the parent.
In July, Fitch Ratings lowered AEGON’s operating companies’ insurer financial strength ratings to AA- and raised the outlook to Stable.

¡

  
Earnings from Life & Protection in the Americas increased to USD 241 million, mainly the result of benefits from cost saving initiatives and the absence of
restructuring charges which affected results last year.




  
¡

  
Individual Savings & Retirement earnings increased to USD 175 million. Fixed annuity earnings rose as yields on the portfolio increased, while results from variable
annuities also improved due to an increase in overall asset balances.




  
¡

  
Earnings from Employer Solutions & Pensions increased to USD 95 million on improved margins and growth of account balances.




  
¡

  
Life reinsurance earnings increased to USD 33 million, a result of more favorable mortality experience compared with the second quarter last year.

Earnings from AEGON’s operations in Canada amounted to USD 15 million, a strong improvement from a loss for the second quarter last year, which included a one-time
charge related to deferred policy acquisition costs of USD 30 million. Net income 
Net income from AEGON’s operations in the Americas declined to USD 255 million as improvements in underlying earnings and impairments were more
than offset by the underperformance of fair value items, increased tax charges and a one-off charge related to a settlement.  The
underperformance in fair value items totaled USD 39 million, mainly due to negative results from credit derivatives and variable annuity guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits products, which were partly offset by gains from the company’s
macro equity hedge.  AEGON has decided to set its short term equity market return assumption in determining estimated gross profits on
variable life and variable annuity products at 9% for the second quarter, reflecting the continued volatility experienced in equity markets and the use of macro equity hedges. This decision resulted in an additional charge of USD 187 million,
which has been included in fair value items, partly offsetting gains from the company’s macro equity hedge.  During the second quarter,
realized gains on investments amounted to USD 21 million and were related to corporate investment grade bonds sold in order to extend the duration of some of AEGON’s investment portfolios. 
Net impairments decreased to USD 73 million in the second quarter, reaching their lowest level in two years and approaching AEGON’s long-term
assumptions. Impairments during the quarter were related primarily to US housing related securities.  Other charges included a one-time
provision of USD 140 million for settlement of a dispute related to a Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) policy in the United States. Subsequent to the disruption in the credit market, which affected the investment value of the policy’s
underlying assets, a suit was filed alleging that the policy terms were not sufficiently fulfilled by AEGON.  AEGON’s run-off businesses
in the Americas recorded a loss in the second quarter of USD 62 million. This better than expected result was due to higher portfolio yields. 
Net income from AEGON’s operations in the Americas included a tax expense in the second quarter of USD 12 million primarily due to a decline in
tax benefits related to cross-border intercompany reinsurance treaties.

 Operating expenses 
Operating expenses declined 17% to USD 484 million as a result of lower restructuring charges and employee benefit plan costs and the transfer of
activities to AEGON Asset Management. Excluding restructuring charges and employee benefit plan costs, operating expenses declined slightly as continued cost saving initiatives were absorbed by the first-time inclusion of our partnership in Brazil.
 Sales and deposits  New life
sales increased 13% compared with the second quarter 2009 to USD 212 million. This was mainly a result of growth in AEGON’s retail life insurance businesses across the Americas. New premium production for accident and health products declined
to USD 180 million, mainly due to the closure last year of AEGON’s automotive credit business in the United States.  Gross deposits,
excluding run-off businesses, increased 1% to USD 6.5 billion as higher pension and retail mutual fund deposits were offset by fixed annuity deposits, which were managed lower. Net deposits, excluding run-off businesses, totaled approximately USD 1
billion as pension, variable annuity and retail mutual fund inflows offset outflows from fixed annuities in the United States and from segregated funds in Canada. 
Value of new business  Value of new
business declined to USD 80 million due primarily to lower fixed annuity sales. The lower contribution from fixed annuities more than offset higher margins of variable annuities and pensions in the United States and an improvement in Canada.
The internal rate of return for the quarter rose to 13%.  Revenue-generating investments 
Compared with the first quarter, revenue-generating investments decreased to USD 302 billion, as new money inflows and the effect of higher bond markets
were more than offset by the impact of a decline in equity markets and outflows from AEGON’s run-off businesses.

¡

  
Underlying earnings before tax amount to EUR 97 million




  
¡

  
Net income rises to EUR 170 million, including book gain on sale of funeral insurance business




  
¡

  
New life sales increase to EUR 41 million mainly as a result of increased pension sales
Underlying earnings before tax   







  
¡

  
Earnings from Life & Savings decreased to EUR 42 million as the comparable quarter last year had included a one-time release of provisions of EUR 20 million. The
loss of earnings due to the sale of AEGON’s Dutch funeral insurance business was more than compensated by improved margins on savings account balances.




  
¡

  
Pension earnings decreased to EUR 29 million mainly due to lower interest results and higher claims.




  
¡

  
Non-life earnings improved to EUR 19 million mainly as a result of favorable claim experience for both motor and fire insurance.




  
¡

  
Earnings from Distribution increased to EUR 6 million, primarily the result of the sale last year of the company’s loss-making real estate brokerage
activities. Net income 
Net income from AEGON’s operations in the Netherlands increased to EUR 170 million. Fair value items improved to EUR 68 million, the result of
positive fair value movements of guarantees and related hedges offset partly by a decline in residential real estate values. Gains on investments amounted to EUR 23 million and were mainly the result of gains on the sale of sovereign bonds.
Impairment charges improved to just EUR 6 million, while Other income reflected a book gain of EUR 33 million on the sale of the funeral insurance business earlier this year. 
Operating expenses  Operating expenses
declined 5% to EUR 182 million in the second quarter. This was the result of cost saving initiatives implemented last year, as well as the transfer of asset management activities in the Netherlands to AEGON Asset Management. On a comparable
basis operating expenses remained stable.  Sales and deposits 
New life sales increased 28% compared with the second quarter last year to EUR 41 million. Individual life sales were higher, due to an increase in demand
for mortgage-related products and a rise in sales of immediate annuities. Overall pension sales also increased mainly as a result of a number of larger group pension contracts secured during the quarter. 
Value of new business  Lower spreads in
both AEGON’s mortgage and annuity businesses resulted in a decrease in the value of new business in the second quarter of 2010 to EUR 30 million. The internal rate of return amounted to 17% during the quarter, exceeding the company’s
minimum hurdle rate.  Revenue-generating investments 
Revenue-generating investments decreased to EUR 69 billion, down 3% compared with the end of the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily the result
of a transfer of assets related to the sale of the funeral insurance business and lower equity markets during the quarter.

Restructuring UK business; targeting cost reductions of 25% by end 2011 to improve returns
Underlying earnings before tax   










  
¡

  
Earnings from Life & Protection increased to GBP 15 million due to an increase in the size of the annuity book and the expenses related to the closure of the
employee benefit business in the comparable quarter last year.




  
¡

  
Pension earnings decreased to GBP 5 million as the positive effects of further business growth and improved equity and credit markets were more than offset by higher
expenses associated with investments in developing new propositions.




  
¡

  
AEGON’s distribution businesses in the United Kingdom benefitted from improved business performance and market conditions, which limited losses during the quarter to GBP 2
million. Net income 
Net income for the second quarter of 2010 increased to GBP 24 million, mainly because of a sharp decline in impairments. Impairments declined
significantly and totaled just GBP 1 million for the quarter. AEGON recorded a loss during the quarter on fair value items in the United Kingdom as a result of a decline in equity markets and an accounting loss on a derivative instrument for
which hedge accounting could not be applied. Gains on investments decreased and comprised essentially gains from the sale of bonds during the quarter, while a larger tax benefit was recorded than in the comparable quarter last year. 
Operating expenses  Operating expenses
decreased 6% to GBP 95 million as a result of cost containment and the transfer of asset management activities at the beginning of the year to AEGON Asset Management, partly offset by investments in developing the UK personal pensions market
proposition and increased project-related costs. In June, AEGON announced to re-focus its UK life and pensions business on two core markets – At Retirement and Workplace Savings – and to reduce operating costs 25% by 2011. Plans to deliver
this expense reduction program are currently under development and further detail will be announced later this year.  Sales and deposits
 New life sales increased 25% to GBP 263 million as higher sales of pension and retirement products more than offset a decrease in
sales of immediate annuities following earlier repricing and the closure of AEGON’s employee benefit business in the United Kingdom in the second quarter last year. Also, the comparable quarter last year included existing AEGON group personal
pension business that was transferred internally to new group pension contracts. AEGON has decided not to include these rewrites as part of new business reporting as this gives a clearer indication of new premium secured. 
Value of new business  Value of new
business in the United Kingdom declined to GBP 20 million due to a decrease in immediate annuity sales as a result of earlier repricing. The internal rate of return on new business during the quarter was 12%. 
Revenue-generating investments 
Revenue-generating investments decreased to GBP 52 billion compared with the end of the previous quarter as the positive effects of inflows were more than
offset by a decline in equity markets during the quarter.

Underlying earnings before tax   







  
¡

  
Earnings from Central & Eastern Europe declined to EUR 19 million mainly as a result of claims related to storms and floods earlier this year in Hungary and
further investments in AEGON’s business in Turkey.




  
¡

  
Operations in Asia made a loss of EUR 11 million as a result of continued investments in the company’s joint ventures in China, India and Japan.





  
¡

  
Earnings from Spain and France increased to EUR 19 million compared with second quarter 2009, mainly due to higher contributions from AEGON’s bancassurance
partnerships in Spain.




  
¡

  
Earnings from asset management amounted to EUR 12 million.
Net income  Net income from New Markets
increased in the second quarter to EUR 15 million. The same period last year had included a significant book loss relating to the sale of AEGON’s life insurance operations in Taiwan. Fair value items recorded a loss as a result of hedging
losses in AEGON’s European variable annuities business, while impairment charges of EUR 9 million reflect a combination of write-downs on investments in Spain and on mortgages sold in Hungary. 
Operating expenses  Operating expenses
amounted to EUR 127 million in the second quarter, an increase from last year due to the inclusion of AEGON Asset Management in New Markets. Operating expenses were, however, 5% lower than in the first quarter of this year as a result of strict
cost control.  Sales and deposits 
New life sales for New Markets declined to EUR 74 million in the second quarter. Sales growth in both Central & Eastern Europe and Asia was
more than offset by lower sales of recurring premium products in Spain.   







  
¡

  
In Spain, total new life sales declined 23% to EUR 41 million as a result of lower production from CAM, one of AEGON’s local savings bank partners, while AEGON’s
own insurance operation and the four other partners all recorded sales growth compared with the second quarter 2009.




  
¡

  
New life sales in Central & Eastern Europe increased to EUR 24 million as a result of strong single premium sales in Poland, continued growth in Hungary and a
successful shift in Turkey from pension to life insurance sales.




  
¡

  
In Asia, new life sales rose to EUR 9 million as both China and India reported increased sales.
New premium production of general insurance increased to EUR 9 million, mainly driven by continued strong household and motor insurance sales in
Hungary. From July 1, 2010, AEGON has been offering household insurance to customers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia as well, leveraging on the experience and expertise of the Hungarian non-life business. 
Gross deposits from New Markets increased to EUR 1.8 billion primarily as a result of a doubling in asset management deposits. 
Value of new business  New Markets’
value of new business amounted to EUR 32 million. Higher contributions from AEGON’s European variable annuities business and the operations in Asia and Central & Eastern Europe were more than offset by a decline in the value of new
business in Spain, driven predominantly by lower production. The internal rate of return remained high at 35%.  Revenue-generating
investments  Revenue-generating investments increased 5% compared with the previous quarter to EUR 30 billion mainly as a result of
increased third-party investments.

 Market developments 
In Spain, the financial sector is undergoing significant consolidation and restructuring. Consequently, a number of the country’s savings banks are
in the process of either merging or entering into so-called integration agreements (SIPs). This process is likely to affect AEGON’s bancassurance partnerships in Spain, particularly as in certain cases newly-formed savings banks now have
several insurance partners and are likely to select just one to do business with in the future. AEGON is not in a position to speculate about the outcome of this process, but intends to maintain its current share of the Spanish insurance market.
 In Hungary, an additional tax has been introduced for financial institutions domiciled in the country. This tax applies to the years 2010,
2011 and 2012. Based on initial estimates, AEGON believes this will lead to additional charges of EUR 20 million in 2010, of which EUR 10 million has been accounted for in the second quarter in Other charges.

 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS FIRST SIX MONTHS 2010 
Net income  AEGON reported a net income
of EUR 785 million for the first six months of 2010, a significant improvement from the loss of EUR 334 million reported for the comparable period last year. This improved result is mainly attributable to higher underlying earnings, a
recovery in fair value items performance, lower impairments and the absence of a few exceptional items offset by higher tax charges. 
Underlying earnings before tax 
AEGON’s underlying earnings before tax increased to EUR 1,010 million in the first half of 2010, a significant improvement compared with the
same period last year. This increase in earnings was due mainly to improved financial markets. In the Americas, earnings increased mainly as a result of higher investment income, a recovery in equity markets and lower expenses. Underlying earnings
remained stable in the Netherlands, while earnings in the United Kingdom clearly benefitted from improved equity and bond markets. Earnings from New Markets increased mainly due to the first time inclusion of earnings from AEGON Asset Management.
 Fair value items  During the
first six months of 2010, fair value items totaled to a loss of EUR 13 million. In the Netherlands, fair value items turned positive mainly due to much improved results from fair value guarantees and related hedges. In the Americas, the first half
year of 2009 had included large gains from fair value guarantees and related hedges, while the first half of 2010 recorded a loss for this fair value item, this was only partly offset by improved results for alternative investments. AEGON’s
credit spread narrowed substantially during the first half of 2009, an effect which did not occur during the first half of 2010. As a result, fair value results for the holding company improved considerably. 
Realized gains on investments  AEGON
realized EUR 274 million of gains from its investment portfolios during the first half of 2010. Gains were primarily related to the sale of bonds driven by asset and liability management. 
Impairment charges  Net impairments have
improved considerably to EUR 227 million for the first half of 2010. The improvement was mainly driven by both lower corporate bond and housing related asset impairments. 
Other charges  Other charges amounted to
EUR 37 million in the first half of 2010 and comprised mainly of a one-time provision of EUR 105 million for settlement of a dispute related to a Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) policy in the United States and a book gain on the sale of
the Dutch funeral insurance business. The comparable period last year had included the book loss related to the sale of AEGON’s life insurance operations in Taiwan. 
Run-off businesses  This line has been
introduced starting this year and contains the results of business units where management has decided to exit the market and to run-off the existing block of business. Currently, this line includes the run-off of the institutional spread-based
business and structured settlements blocks of business in the United States. The total loss in the first half year of 2010 amounted to EUR 109 million. 
Income tax  During the first half of
2010, tax charges amounted to EUR 113 million compared with tax benefits of EUR 455 million in the comparable period last year. These benefits were mainly related to impairments, marked-to-market losses on fair value items and tax exempt
items. AEGON also booked a tax gain of EUR 252 million in the first half of 2009 related to cross border intercompany reinsurance transactions between Ireland and the United States. 
Operating expenses  To improve returns
from its businesses, AEGON introduced a number of initiatives to reduce operating expenses. As a result, operating expenses declined 1% compared with the first half of 2009 to EUR 1,653 million in the first half of 2010.

 New life sales 
New life sales increased 7% during the first six months of 2010 to EUR 1,128 million driven by improved results in most units. In the Americas,
increases were mainly due to retail new life sales, in particular term life sales. In the Netherlands, both individual life and group pension sales increased, while in the United Kingdom pensions were the main driver of sales growth. 
Deposits  Gross deposits, excluding
run-off businesses, amounted to EUR 15.4 billion in the first half of 2010, an increase of 9% compared with the first half of 2009. The increase was mainly driven by higher pensions and variable annuity deposits offset by lower fixed annuity
deposits, which were managed lower.  Value of new business 
AEGON’s value of new business declined to EUR 294 million in the first half of 2010 mainly due to a decrease in both the United Kingdom and the
United States. In the United Kingdom the main reason for the decline is lower immediate annuity sales following repricing. The reduction in the value of new business in the United States was primarily the result of lower fixed annuity sales. In
Spain, lower sales of risk products also led to a lower value of new business.  Revenue-generating investments 
Revenue-generating investments increased to EUR 409 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2010. The recovery in equity markets, the positive effects
of risk free interest rates and lower spreads as well as the strengthening of the US dollar and the pound sterling all contributed to the increase compared with December 31, 2009. 
Capital management 
At the end of the second quarter, AEGON’s core capital position, excluding revaluation reserves, amounted to EUR 18.6 billion,
equivalent to 74% of the company’s total capital base and above its target threshold of 70%. AEGON’s aim is to increase the proportion of core capital over time to
75%6. 
AEGON’s revaluation reserves at June 30, 2010, turned positive for the first time in almost three years and amounted to EUR 588 million. This
significant improvement is mainly the result of an increase in the value of fixed income securities.  Shareholders’ equity rose to EUR
17.2 billion mainly as a result of the improved revaluation reserves, strengthening of the US dollar and the pound sterling against the euro and the addition of first half years’ net income. 
Excess capital above S&P’s AA capital adequacy requirements amounted to EUR 3.0 billion, down from EUR 3.7 billion at the end of 2009. Positive
contributions from earnings and capital preservation measures were more than offset by increased capital requirements for asset related risks. Standard & Poor’s revised their risk factors significantly increasing applied charges
primarily related to bond portfolios. As a result, capital requirements in the Americas rose during the first half of 2010 by USD 1.4 billion. 
At June 30, 2010, AEGON’s Insurance Group Directive (IGD) capital surplus totaled EUR 7 billion, equivalent to a solvency ratio of
approximately 200%.  Risk management 
Standard & Poor’s has upgraded its assessment of AEGON’s enterprise risk management (ERM) framework to ‘strong’, reflecting
significant advances the company has made in developing its risk management framework and the fact that this framework is now fully embedded in its business. 
The financial strength ratings of AEGON’s US operating companies were upgraded by A.M. Best to A+ with a Stable outlook, reflecting A.M. Best’s
assessment of the financial strength and support of the parent. In July, Fitch Ratings has lowered AEGON’s operating companies’ insurer financial strength ratings to AA- and raised the outlook to Stable. 
During the first half of 2010, AEGON reduced its already limited exposure to peripheral European sovereign bonds, which amounted to a market value of EUR
1.5 billion at June 30, 2010. As part of this reduction, AEGON sold approximately EUR 470 million in Spanish government bonds.

 Notes:   


1)

 For a definition of underlying earnings and the reconciliation from underlying earnings to income before tax we refer to Note 3 “Segment
information” of our Condensed consolidated interim financial statements. 


2)

 Net income refers to net income attributable to equity holders of AEGON N.V. and minority interest. 


3)

 New life sales is defined as new recurring premiums + 1/10 of single premiums. 


4)

 Deposits on and off balance sheet. Run-off businesses includes results of business units where management has decided to exit the market and to run-off
the existing block of business. 


5)

 Return on equity is calculated by dividing the net underlying earnings after cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity excluding the
preferred shares and the revaluation reserve. 


6)

 Capital securities that are denominated in foreign currencies are, for purposes of calculating the capital base ratio, revalued to the period-end
exchange rate. All ratios exclude AEGON’s revaluation reserve. 


7)

 Included in other income/(charges) are charges made to policyholders with respect to income tax in the United Kingdom. 


8)

 Includes production on investment contracts without a discretionary participation feature of which the proceeds are not recognized as revenues but are
directly added to our investment contract liabilities. 


9)

 APE = recurring premium + 1/10 single premium. 


10)

 PVNBP: Present Value New Business Premium.   


a)
The calculation of the IGD (Insurance Group Directive) capital surplus and ratio are based on Solvency I capital requirements on IFRS for entities within the EU (Pillar
1 for AEGON UK), and local regulatory solvency measurements for non-EU entities. Specifically, required capital for the life insurance companies in the US is calculated as two times the upper end of the Company Action Level range (200%) as applied
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the US. The calculation of the IGD ratio excludes the available and required capital of the UK With-Profit funds. In the UK solvency surplus calculation the local regulator only allows the
available capital number of the With-Profit funds included in overall local available capital to be equal to the amount of With-Profit funds’ required capital. 


b)
The results in this release are unaudited.

 Cautionary note regarding non-GAAP measures 
This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures: underlying earnings before tax and value of new business. The reconciliation of
underlying earnings before tax to the most comparable IFRS measure is provided in Note 3 “Segment information” of our Condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Value of new business is not based on IFRS, which are used to report
AEGON’s quarterly statements and should not viewed as a substitute for IFRS financial measures. AEGON believes that these non-GAAP measures, together with the IFRS information, provide a meaningful measure for the investment community to
evaluate AEGON’s business relative to the businesses of our peers.  Local currencies and constant currency exchange rates
 This press release contains certain information about our results and financial condition in USD for the Americas and GBP for the United
Kingdom, because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is
a substitute for or superior to financial information about us presented in EUR, which is the currency of our primary financial statements.
