BALLARD POWER SYSTEMS INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


Unaudited (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollar, except per share amounts and number of shares)









 

1.     Basis of presentation:

 

The accompanying financial information reflects the same accounting policies and methods of application as the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The accompanying financial information does not include all disclosure required under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) because certain information included in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 has not been included in this report. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited but reflect all adjustments required for the fair presentation in accordance with GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009.

 

Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the basis of presentation adopted in the current period.

 

2.     Changes in accounting policy and future changes to accounting standards:

 

(a)   Employee future benefit plans:

 

CICA Handbook Section 3461 Employee Future Benefits allows the selection of either the immediate recognition approach, or the defer and amortization approach, for accounting for employee future benefits.  In 2009, the Corporation changed its accounting policy from the defer and amortization approach to the immediate recognition approach.  The Corporation believes the change in accounting policy more appropriately reflects the costs and liability of the employee future benefits as it better reflects the current estimated cost to terminate these plans.

 

The change in accounting policy was applied retroactively and prior period financial statements have been restated, as follows:

 





  


·


Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased by $640,000 and $667,000 respectively (representing no change in earnings and diluted earnings per share for the respective periods), with a corresponding decrease in long-term liabilities.




 

(b)  Convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards:

 

In February 2008, Canada’s Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) confirmed that Canadian GAAP, as used by publicly accountable enterprises, will be fully converged to International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

Unaudited (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollar, except per share amounts and number of shares)









 






2.


Changes in accounting policy and future changes to accounting standards (cont’d):




 





  


Canadian publicly accountable enterprises must adopt IFRS for their interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011 and must be accompanied by IFRS comparative information for the 2010 financial year.




 





  


IFRS uses a conceptual framework similar to Canadian GAAP, but there are significant differences on recognition, measurement and disclosures.  At this time, the comprehensive impact of the changeover from Canadian GAAP to IFRS on the Corporation’s future financial position and results of operations is not yet determinable.




 

3.    Business acquisition:

 

On January 18, 2010, the Corporation acquired a controlling interest (the “Acquisition”) in Denmark-based Dantherm Power A/S (“Dantherm Power”), partnering with co-investors Dantherm A/S and Danfoss A/S.  In exchange for an initial investment of 15,000,000 Danish Kroner, or $2,915,000, the Corporation obtained a 45.14% interest in Dantherm Power including the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.  Through the Corporation’s ability to elect a majority of the members of the Dantherm Power board, who have the power to determine the strategic operating, investing and financing policies of Dantherm Power, the Corporation holds effective control over Dantherm Power as of the date of the initial investment.

 

As a result, all assets, liabilities and results of operations of Dantherm Power are consolidated and have been included in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Fuel Cell Products segment.  Ownership interests in Dantherm Power, other than the Corporation’s, are shown as non-controlling interests.  The non-controlling interest was valued based on the price paid for the controlling interest by the Corporation on its initial acquisition date.

 

In August 2010, the Corporation invested an additional 15,000,000 Danish Kroner, or $2,566,000, in Dantherm Power for an additional 7% interest, resulting in a 52% total equity interest at that time.

 

Dantherm Power is focused on development and production of commercially viable cell-based back-up power systems for use in information technology and telecom network base stations.

3.     Business acquisition (cont’d):


 

The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations of Dantherm Power have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.  The intangible assets arising from this acquisition are amortized over their estimated useful life of 5 years.

 

The following is the preliminary purchase price allocated including the initial assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

Management is currently carrying out a more specific analysis of the purchase price allocation and changes may be made to the determination of the fair value, the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed as further information becomes available.  As a result, the actual amounts allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related operating results may vary from the amounts initially recorded.

 

Since the date of acquisition, Dantherm Power revenue of $1,485,000 and net loss attributable to Ballard Power Systems Inc. of $3,031,000 have been included in the Corporation’s statement of operations.  Pro forma revenue and net loss attributable to the Corporation as if Dantherm Power was acquired on January 1, 2010 would not be materially different than the amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations in 2010.

Non-dilutive financing:




 

On December 31, 2008, the Corporation completed a restructuring transaction with Superior Plus Income Fund (“Superior Plus”) to reorganize the Corporation’s business under a Plan of Arrangement (the “Arrangement”).  Pursuant to the Arrangement, Superior Plus transferred $38,029,000 (CDN $46,319,000) to the Corporation’s parent company (“Old Ballard”).  Old Ballard subsequently transferred all of its assets and liabilities (including the net cash proceeds, but excluding Old Ballard’s historic Canadian income tax carry forward attributes), to a new wholly-owned company (“the Corporation”).  Old Ballard’s shareholders exchanged their shares, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of the Corporation.  The Corporation is carrying on 
the full scope of Old Ballard’s business operations, and holds all rights to intellectual property, as held by Old Ballard before the completion of the Arrangement.

 

As the transfer of the business assets, liabilities and operations from Old Ballard to the Corporation represented a transaction with no change in shareholder ownership, the transaction was accounted for using continuity of interest accounting.

 

Pursuant to continuity of interest accounting, the assets transferred and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values as reported by Old Ballard immediately prior to the completion of the Arrangement.  As a result, the net cash proceeds were recorded as a credit to shareholders’ equity.

 





5.


Sale-leaseback transaction:




 

On March 9, 2010, the Corporation completed a sale and leaseback agreement with Madison Pacific Properties Inc. (“Madison”) whereby the Corporation sold its head office building in Burnaby, British Columbia in return for gross cash proceeds of $20,427,000 (Canadian $20,750,000).  The Corporation then leased the property back from Madison for an initial 15-year term plus two 5-year renewal options.  On the closing of the transaction, the Corporation recorded a deferred gain of $9,512,000, consisting of $6,242,000 allocated to the building and $3,270,000 allocated to the land, both of which will be recognized to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the 15-year lease.  Due to the long-term nature of the lease, the leaseback of the building qualifies as a capital lease.  As a
 result, on the closing of the transaction the Corporation recorded assets under capital lease of $12,180,000, and a corresponding obligation under capital lease (note 8), representing the net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease allocated to the building and an operating lease for the leaseback of the land.  The future lease payments allocated to the building are included in the table in note 8, while the future lease payments allocated to the land are $610,000 per year for the next 15 years.

12.   Segmented financial information:

 

The Corporation’s business operates in three market segments:

 





  


·


Fuel Cell Products: Fuel cell products and services for motive power (consisting of the material handling and bus markets) and stationary power (consisting of the back-up power, supplemental power, and distributed generation markets) applications;




 





  


·


Contract Automotive: Contract manufacturing of light-duty automotive fuel cell products and testing and engineering services provided primarily to AFCC, Daimler and Ford; and




 





  


·


Material Products: Carbon fiber material products primarily for automotive applications and gas diffusion layer (“GDL”) material for fuel cell products.




 

Segment revenues and segment income (loss) represent the primary financial measures used by senior management in assessing performance and allocating resources, and include the revenues, cost of product and service revenues and expenses for which management is held accountable.  Segment expenses include research and product development costs directly related to individual segments.

 

Costs associated with shared services and other shared costs are allocated based on headcount and square footage. Corporate amounts include expenses for research and product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, which apply generally across all segments and are reviewed separately by senior management.

12.   Segmented financial information (cont’d):

 

A significant portion of the Corporation’s production, testing and lab equipment, and facilities, as well as intellectual property, are common across the segments.  Therefore, management does not classify asset information on a segmented basis.  Instead, performance assessments of these assets and related resource allocations are done on a company-wide basis.
