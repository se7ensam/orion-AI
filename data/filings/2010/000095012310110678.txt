</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>December&nbsp;3, 2010 &#151; ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN AUD$</B></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Calgary, Alberta &#151; Agrium Inc. (TSX and NYSE: AGU) announced today that it has successfully
completed its acquisition of AWB Limited (&#147;AWB&#148;) at a price of A$1.50 per share in cash (purchase
price of A$1.236-billion) as agreed to in the Scheme of Arrangement, including the A$0.15 per share
franked dividend paid on November&nbsp;30, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&#147;We are excited about the opportunity to merge AWB&#146;s strong market presence and extensive
experience with Agrium&#146;s international crop input sourcing capabilities, with a view to further
enhancing product and service offerings to Australian and New Zealand customers,&#148; said Mike Wilson,
Agrium CEO and President. &#147;I would like to thank the management team of AWB for all their efforts
to make this a seamless process and to extend a warm welcome to all AWB employees,&#148; continued Mr.
Wilson.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Landmark business is a leading agricultural retailer in Australia, with over 200 company
operated retail locations, over 140 additional retail franchise and wholesale customer locations in
Australia and investments in various related joint venture companies. With regard to the Commodity
Management operations, Agrium has not had direct participation in the grain handling and trading
business to date. We continue to evaluate our options with respect to this business and we expect
to provide clarity on this in the near future. Agrium expects the acquisition of AWB to be
accretive in 2011.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">About Agrium
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Agrium Inc. is a major retail supplier of agricultural products and services in both North and
South America and a leading global producer and marketer of agricultural nutrients and industrial
products. Agrium produces and markets three primary groups of nutrients: nitrogen, phosphate and
potash as well as controlled release fertilizers and micronutrients. Agrium&#146;s strategy is to grow
through incremental expansion of its existing operations and acquisitions as well as the
development, commercialization and marketing of new products and international opportunities.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">About AWB
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">AWB was formed in 1939 as the Australian Wheat Board and was Australia&#146;s statutory grain marketing
authority for over 60&nbsp;years. Operations are conducted through two main divisions: Landmark and
Commodity Management. Landmark Rural Services is Australia&#146;s largest distributor
of merchandise and fertilizer, with over 400 locations across Australia and New Zealand providing a
diverse range of rural services including rural merchandise, crop chemicals, fertilizer, livestock,
wool marketing, agronomy services and real estate agency services. The division includes 50&nbsp;percent
ownership interests in Hi-Fert, a wholesale fertilizer distribution company currently held for
sale, Australian Wool Handlers and RD1, a New Zealand farm supply company. Following the sale of
Landmark Financial Services&#146; loan and deposit books announced in December&nbsp;2009, Landmark Rural
Services also includes the remainder of the finance businesses (including insurance, wealth
management, and equipment finance).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AWB&#146;s Commodity Management business activities include grain merchandising, pool management
services, storage and handling, and trade finance. Grain marketing, pool management and logistics
in Australia fall under Australian Commodity Management, while activities conducted internationally
through AWB Geneva and AWB India fall under International Commodity Management.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 9pt; margin-top: 0pt"><I>Certain statements and other information included in this press release constitute &#147;forward looking
information&#148; within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation or constitute
&#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning of applicable U.S. securities legislation
(collectively, the &#147;forward-looking statements&#148;). All statements in this press release, other than
those relating to historical information or current conditions, are forward-looking statements,
including, but not limited to, statements as to management&#146;s expectations with respect to, business
and financial prospects, plans, strategies, objectives and expectations, including with respect to
future operations of AWB and Agrium and the expected synergies to be realized by Agrium in
connection with the acquisition of AWB, including the expected timing of Agrium realizing such
synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from
such forward-looking statements.</I></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 9pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Events or circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to: the possibility that the businesses of
Agrium and AWB may not be integrated successfully on the timelines currently contemplated, or at
all, or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; disruption
from the acquisition making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees
and suppliers; the increased interest charges and financial risk faced by Agrium due to the
additional indebtedness incurred by Agrium to fund the AWB acquisition; general business and
economic conditions; the possibility that the completion of the AWB acquisition by Agrium may
trigger change of control provisions in AWB&#146;s commercial or financial agreements and may lead to
adverse consequences; and other risk factors detailed from time to time in Agrium reports filed
with the Canadian securities regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United
States. In addition, the business of AWB is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will
apply equally to Agrium&#146;s operation of AWB&#146;s business, and to Agrium on a consolidated basis, now
that the acquisition of AWB has been completed and events or circumstances arising from such risks
and uncertainties could equally cause Agrium&#146;s actual results to differ materially from those
outlined in forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited
to, those arising due to the following factors: AWB is exposed to both Australian and international
weather patterns and natural disasters and associated changes in agricultural activity; AWB&#146;s
business units are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for agricultural commodities and
freight; AWB&#146;s earnings can be impacted by market dynamics and trading strategy; AWB could be
negatively impacted by a loss of accreditation in Australia; AWB is subject to dispute and
litigation risk (including as a result of being named in litigation commenced by the Iraqi
Government relating to the United Nations Oil-For-Food Programme), as well as counterparty and
sovereign risk; that AWB has not been subject to Canadian and U.S. internal control and regulatory
compliance standards to which Agrium is subject and, as a result, AWB may have had internal
control and compliance failures in the past; and AWB is subject to refinancing requirements and is
exposed to interest rate changes.</I></DIV>
