<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Alberta Star Development Corp., (the "Company") listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (ASX), on the OTCBB (ASXSF) and on the Frankfurt Exchange (QLD), is pleased to announce that at its annual and special meeting (the &#147;Meeting&#148;) of shareholders held on February 8, 2010, shareholders approved a special resolution to consolidate (the &#147;Consolidation&#148;) its issued and outstanding common shares (&#147;Common Shares&#148;) at a ratio (the &#147;Ratio&#148;) of one (1) new Common Share for up to every five (5) outstanding Common Shares. The 5:1 Ratio has been approved by the Board of Directors after the Meeting. No name change or change of trading symbol will be undertaken in connection with the Consolidation.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company&#146;s consolidated Common Shares will begin trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol &#147;ASX&#148; effective as of the opening of trading on March 11, 2010. Currently, there are 107,019,894 Common Shares outstanding. Following the Consolidation there will be approximately 21,403,979 Common Shares outstanding. Any fractional Common Shares resulting from the Consolidation will be cancelled.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Board of Directors of the Company has concluded that the Consolidation is in the best interests of the shareholders and that the Consolidation will have no substantive economic effect on the shareholders, whose ownership percentage in the Company will remain unchanged. The Consolidation is expected to lead to increased interest to a wider audience of potential investors and would better position the Company to broaden its financing alternatives and pursue acquisition opportunities.</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Company is a Canadian mineral exploration company that identifies, acquires and finances advanced stage mineral exploration projects in North America. The Company is committed to creating long term shareholder value through the discovery of base and precious metals.

In addition, statements relating to &#147;resources&#148; are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they invol
ve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future. In particular, this document contains, without limitation, forward-looking statements pertaining to the following: expectations of management regarding the proposed Consolidation, including the timing of completion of the Consolidation and the effect of the Consolidation on the Company's operations.</P>

These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the following: that the failure of the Company to obtain the necessary Exchange, regulatory and other third party approvals required in order to proceed wi
th the proposed Consolidation and the other factors described under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in the Company&#146;s annual reports and Form 20-F available in Canada at <FONT color=#000000>www.sedar.com</FONT>, as well as on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
