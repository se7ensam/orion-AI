Ballard Reports First Quarter 2010 Results


For Immediate Release – April 28, 2010


VANCOUVER, CANADA– Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDP) announced its financial results
for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 today. All amounts are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise
noted.


John Sheridan, President and CEO said “Our first quarter results are strong, consistent with the
full year outlook provided in January. With 47% revenue growth year-over-year and 29% order book
growth during the first quarter, Ballard is well-positioned to meet guidance for full year revenue
growth in excess of 35%.”


First Quarter 2010 Highlights


Growth:






     
    •
     
    Consolidated revenues of $11.9 million, growth of 47% year-over-year.






(Pre-consolidation, excluding Dantherm Power, Ballard’s revenue was $11.2 million,
representing 38% growth.)






     
    •
     
    Fuel cell product shipments of 328 units, growth of 73% year-over-year.









     
    •
     
    Twelve-month rolling order book of $29.0 million, an increase of $6.7 million or 29%
from year-end 2009.









     
    •
     
    All six growth milestones for 2010 are “on track”.









     
    •
     
    Launched FuelWorksTM, a new center of excellence for development of
fuel processing technology, in partnership with the University of Maryland and the
Department of Defense’ Army Research Laboratory.





Profitability:






     
    •
     
    Consolidated operating expense of $12.1 million, a reduction of 6% year-over-year.






(Pre-consolidation, Ballard’s operating expense was $9.7 million, a reduction of 25%
year-over-year.) Benefits of a 30% reset of the company’s cost base in 2009 were partially
offset by the negative effects of a stronger Canadian dollar.






     
    •
     
    Consolidated EBITDA1 of ($8.6) million, an improvement of $8.8 million or
51%.






(Pre-consolidation, Ballard’s EBITDA1 was ($7.6) million, an improvement of 56%.)






     
    •
     
    Consolidated net loss of $10.0 million or $0.12 per share, an improvement of $9.1
million or $0.11 per share year-over-year.






(Pre-consolidation, Ballard’s net loss was $9.0 million, an improvement of $10.1 million.)






     
    •
     
    Consolidated cash flow from operations of ($14.2) million, compared with ($8.6) million
in the first quarter of 2009. This expected increase was primarily due to four factors:
significant inventory build-up for committed purchase orders; payment of accrued severance;
payment of accrued acquisition costs; and timing of accounts receivable collections.






(Pre-consolidation, Ballard’s cash flow from operations was ($11.5) million.) These impacts
are consistent with Ballard’s goal of improving cash flow from operations by 30% for the full
year, excluding the cash flow impact of Dantherm Power.


Note: The acquisition of a controlling equity position in Dantherm Power was announced on January
18, 2010. This is the first quarter that Dantherm Power’s results are consolidated in Ballard’s
reported financial results, therefore additional information is provided below. As indicated at the
time of the announcement, committed investments of Ballard and the minority shareholders Danfoss
A/S and Dantherm A/S, are expected to meet the total funding requirements of Dantherm Power through
to positive cash flow. Ballard’s share of this total committed investment is $6 million, with $3
million invested on closing and the subsequent $3 million prior to 2012.

Our revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased 47%, to $11.9 million, compared to $8.1
million for the first quarter of 2009. Increases in our core Fuel Cell Products segment of $1.1
million, combined with increases in our supporting Material Products segment of $3.0 million, more
than offset the slight declines in our supporting Contract Automotive business segment of $0.3
million.


In our core Fuel Cell Products business segment, first quarter of 2010 revenues increased 28%, or
$1.1 million, to $5.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2009. The overall increase was
driven by higher materials handling revenues as a result of shipments to support Plug Power Inc.’s
GenDrive™ systems combined with increases in our backup power market as a result of increased
shipments to IdaTech, LLC. Revenues were also positively impacted by the acquisition, and
subsequent consolidation, of Dantherm Power’s operating results which contributed $0.7 million of
revenue. Fuel cell bus revenues were down slightly as shipments in 2010 to SunLine Transit Agency
and Advanced Public Transportation System bv were lower than shipments in 2009 for the Transport of
London fuel cell bus program.


In our supporting Contract Automotive and Material Products business segments, first quarter
revenues increased 65%, or $2.7 million, to $6.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Improvements in our Material Products segment of $3.0 million represents increased volumes of
carbon friction material products related to the recovery in the U.S. automotive sector in 2010 as
compared to 2009. Slight declines in our Contract Automotive segment of $0.3 million were as a
result of lower automotive testing and engineering services provided to AFCC which was only
partially offset by increased shipments of light duty automotive products in support of Daimler’s
Highway 2/3 programs.


Consolidated EBITDA1 for the first quarter of 2010 improved by $8.8 million, to ($8.6)
million, compared to ($17.4) million, in the first quarter of 2009. EBITDA1, excluding
the impact related to our controlling ownership interest in Dantherm Power of ($1.0) million,
improved $9.8 million to ($7.6) million, from the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in
EBITDA1 of $9.8 million, excluding the impact of Dantherm Power, was driven by gross
margin increases of $1.6 million as a result of higher revenues, lower operating expenses of $3.2
million (excluding depreciation and amortization, and restructuring and related charges), and
improved investment and other income of $1.5 million. The $3.2 million, or 25%, reduction in
operating expenses was primarily a result of our 2009 workforce reduction and cost optimization
initiatives which were partially offset by the negative effects in 2010 of a stronger Canadian
dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar. EBITDA1 for the first quarter of 2009 was
negatively impacted by equity losses in Ebara Ballard Corporation of $2.9 million incurred prior to
our decision to discontinue operations in Ebara Ballard Corporation on May 24, 2009, and by
restructuring and related charges of $1.1 million as a result of a 7% workforce reduction initiated
in March 2009.


Net loss excluding non-controlling interests for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by $9.1
million, to $10.0 million, or ($0.12) per share, compared with a net loss of $19.1 million, or
($0.23) per share, in the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in net loss of $9.1 million was
driven by the above improvement in EBITDA1. Net loss, excluding the negative impact
related to our controlling interest in Dantherm Power of $1.1 million, improved $10.1 million to
$9.0 million, from the first quarter of 2009.


Cash used in operating activities in the first quarter of 2010 increased by $5.6 million to $14.2
million, compared to $8.6 million for the first quarter of 2009. Cash used in operating activities,
excluding the negative impact of Dantherm Power of $2.8 million, increased $2.9 million to $11.4
million, from the first quarter of 2009.


The higher cash used in operating activities of $2.9 million, excluding the results of Dantherm
Power, was as expected and is primarily a result of working capital impacts related to the buildup
of inventory in the quarter to support expected future automotive fuel cell shipments to Daimler,
the payment of accrued severance and accrued acquisition costs, and the expected timing of revenues
and the related customer collections. The cash used in operating activities of Dantherm Power of
$2.8 million in the first quarter of 2010 was driven by higher than expected working capital
impacts as a result of the timing of customer collections, combined with higher than expected
operating expenses primarily as a result of delays in the filing of government grant applications.
Both of these items are expected to correct in the following quarter.

Endnotes:

1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used to assist in assessing Ballard’s financial
performance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are
therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. EBITDA
measures our net loss after excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation of
property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges.
We believe EBITDA assists investors in assessing our actual and future performance. Consolidated
EBITDA includes EBITDA attributable to our controlling interest in Dantherm Power.
