 Operating Review  Fourth Quarter  Acergy Northern Europe and Canada – Revenue from
continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $163.5 million (Q4 2008: $226.1 million) reflecting lower activity levels, as anticipated, in an ongoing challenging market environment, partly offset by good operational progress on Ormen Lange,
Gjoa, DONG Nini East, Norne and Deep Panuke, of which the latter remained in early stages. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $36.3 million (Q4 2008: $65.4 million), reflecting lower activity levels due to current
market conditions offset by good operational performance of projects awarded in previous years, including the successful early completion of the Ormen Lange Project and good vessel utilisation. Net operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2008 included a credit of $33.0 million arising on the settlement of a Norwegian defined benefit pension scheme. Commercial negotiations regarding claims and variation orders on the Marathon Volund Project continue.  Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $62.0 million (Q4 2008: $45.0 million)
reflecting good progress on the offshore phase of the BHP Pyrenees Project, Bluewater Al-Sheehan Project and the Pluto Project, which remained in early stages. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $10.4 million (Q4
2008: $2.1 million) reflecting good performance on the BHP Pyrenees and Pluto Projects, together with a positive contribution from the SapuraAcergy joint venture.  Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $320.1 million (Q4 2008: $207.7 million) reflecting good operational progress on a number
of major projects, including Block 15, EPC4A, Angola LNG and PazFlor and a good contribution from Sonamet in the quarter. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $65.4 million (Q4 2008: $22.8 million) reflecting strong
operational performance on Block 15, good project performance across the project portfolio, including EPC4A, Angola LNG, PazFlor and Sonamet, and good utilisation of Acergy Polaris and Acergy Legend, which were in dry-dock in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for
the fourth quarter was $11.0 million (Q4 2008: $1.8 million) reflecting the contribution from the offshore installation phase of the Hess Conger Project, which completed during the quarter. Net operating income from continuing operations for the
quarter was $9.2 million (Q4 2008: $3.9 million) primarily due to the successful completion of the cross-regional Frade Project and the completion of the Perdido and Hess Conger Projects.  Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $63.5 million (Q4 2008: $90.9 million)
reflecting anticipated lower activity levels partly offset by the three ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras, which achieved full utilisation during the quarter and the contribution from the Frade Project, which completed during the
quarter. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $13.2 million (Q4 2008: $7.4 million) due to the successful completion of the cross-regional Frade Project and strong performance from Acergy Harrier, Acergy
Condor and Pertinacia.  Acergy Corporate – Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $1.8
million (Q4 2008: loss of $3.6 million) reflecting personnel services and related costs charged to the SapuraAcergy joint venture. Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $21.0 million (Q4 2008: net operating income $1.1
million) primarily due to the lower contribution from the NKT Flexibles and SHL joint ventures of $9.3 million (Q4 2008: $21.6 million) and lower utilisation of corporate vessels, partially offset by a reduction in administrative expenses.
 Full Year  Acergy Northern Europe and Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $648.8 million (2008: $843.1 million) reflecting lower activity levels and lower ship utilisation, as anticipated, in an
ongoing challenging market environment. Good operational progress was made on DONG Nini East, Ormen Lange, Gjoa, and Deep Panuke, of which the latter remained in relatively early stages. Net operating income from continuing operations for fiscal
year 2009 was $67.4 million (2008: $192.0 million), reflecting lower activity levels and pricing pressures due to current market conditions, partially offset by good operational performance across many projects, including DONG Nini East and Ormen
Lange and lower administrative expenses resulting from cost reduction measures taken during the year. These results also reflect additional operating expenses on the Marathon Volund Project, which completed during the year, although commercial
negotiations remain ongoing. Net operating income for fiscal year 2008 included a credit of $33.0 million arising on the settlement of a Norwegian defined benefit pension scheme.

 Acergy Asia and Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009
was $206.0 million (2008: $180.8 million) reflecting good progress on SURF projects in offshore installation phase, including Van Gogh, BHP Pyrenees, Bluewater Al Sheehan, and the Pluto Project, which remained in early stages. Net operating income
from continuing operations in fiscal year 2009 was $37.8 million (2008: $14.4 million) due to the completion of the Dai Hung, Van Gogh and Bluewater Al Sheehan Projects, good project performance on the Pluto and BHP Pyrenees Projects and a positive
contribution from the SapuraAcergy joint venture.  Acergy Africa and Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for
fiscal year 2009 was $999.7 million (2008: $1,175.9 million) reflecting lower SURF and Conventional activity levels due to the delay in contract awards, partially offset by good progress on a number of ongoing projects including Block 15, EPC4A,
PazFlor, Angola LNG, together with EPC2B and Tombua Landana which completed during the year, and a strong contribution from Sonamet. A number of major projects in this segment, including Angola LNG, EGP3B and PazFlor remain in early stages. Net
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $171.3 million (2008: $183.7 million) reflecting lower SURF activity, partially offset by good project performance across the project portfolio, including Block 15, EPC4A, Tombua
Landana, EPC2B, PazFlor and Sonamet and the completion of an extensive seven month upgrade and dry-docking programme on Acergy Polaris in early 2009.  Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $57.8 million (2008: $4.4 million) reflecting the completion of the Perdido
and Hess Conger Projects. Net operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $26.0 million (2008: $10.5 million) primarily due to the successful completion of the cross-regional Frade Project and the Perdido Project which
completed during the year.  Acergy South America – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was
$288.8 million (2008: $320.1 million) reflecting anticipated lower contribution from lump-sum SURF projects partly offset by the three ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras, which achieved good utilisation during the year and the
contribution from the Frade and Roncador Manifold Projects, which completed during the year. Net operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $37.5 million (2008: $22.6 million) arising from good performance on all activities
and the successful completion of the Frade Project.  Acergy Corporate – Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year
2009 was $7.7 million (2008: loss of $1.9 million) reflecting personnel services and related costs charged to the SapuraAcergy joint venture. Net operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $2.7 million (2008: $37.6 million)
primarily due to a reduction of $38.5 million from Acergy Corporate joint ventures: NKT Flexibles contributed $21.7 million (2008: $45.6 million), reflecting challenging conditions in the flexible pipe market; and Seaway Heavy Lifting contributed
$15.0 million (2008: $29.6 million).  Discontinued operations  Net income from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $2.4 million (Q4 2008: $1.5 million) due to the small positive contribution for the Mexilhao Trunkline Project.
 Net income from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2009 was $7.2 million (2008: net operating loss of $22.5 million) due to the positive
contribution from Mexilhao Trunkline Project in Brazil.  Asset Development  Post year-end Acergy announced the acquisition of Acergy Borealis, a versatile deepwater ship for operations in challenging and harsh environments
worldwide. Final completion and operational delivery of the ship is scheduled for the first half of 2012. Total costs, upon delivery, are expected to be less than $500m, including approximately $260m relating to the acquisition of the ship and
delivery as per the original design. This investment will be funded entirely from the Company’s existing cash resources.  The Sonamet
joint venture remained fully consolidated as at November 30, 2009 although it continues to be classified as ‘Assets held for sale’. After the completion of the sale and transfer of shares the business will be deconsolidated from
Acergy’s financials and its future results will be reported as share of results of associates and joint ventures.

 Post year end, a fire occurred on Acergy Falcon while in dry-dock. No material impact on earnings
is expected.  Financial Review  Fourth Quarter  Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $622 million (Q4 2008: $568 million)
primarily reflecting good activity levels in West Africa and Asia Pacific partly offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea and Brazil, as anticipated.  Gross profit was $167 million (Q4 2008: $145 million) reflecting good project execution and increased vessel utilisation partly offset by lower activity levels and the current portfolio mix with fewer
major deepwater projects in installation phase or completed during the quarter compared to 2008, and the recognition of a $30 million pension credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Administrative expenses were $67 million (Q4 2008: $68 million).  Acergy’s share of results of associates and joint ventures was $14 million (Q4 2008: $26 million) reflecting positive albeit lower contributions from NKT Flexibles and Seaway Heavy Lifting, and a
positive contribution from SapuraAcergy.  The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the three months was 26.3% (Q4 2008:
23.8%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 25.9% (Q4 2008: 18.9%).  Other gains were $13 million (Q4
2008: $35 million) primarily reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation on short-term inter-company and cash balances.  Income
before taxes from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $119 million (Q4 2008: $136 million) reflecting good operational performance and increased vessel utilisation. This was partly offset by anticipated lower activity levels,
particularly in the North Sea, a lower contribution from associates and joint ventures and a lower contribution from other gains due to foreign exchange movements.  Taxation for the quarter was $40 million (Q4 2008: $46 million) resulting in an effective tax rate for the quarter of 34% (Q4 2008: 34%) reflecting the current geographical portfolio mix of our business.
 Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $79 million (Q4 2008: $90 million). Net income from total operations for the
fourth quarter was $81 million (Q4 2008: $91 million).  Full Year  Revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $2,209 million (2008: $2,522 million) primarily reflecting lower activity levels in the North Sea, West Africa and Brazil, as anticipated,
partly offset by good activity levels in Asia Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico.  Gross profit was $525 million (2008: $648 million) reflecting
the lower activity levels and the current portfolio mix with fewer major deepwater projects in installation phase or completed during the year, compared to 2008 and the recognition of a $30 million pension credit in fiscal year 2008. This was
partially offset by good project execution, high vessel utilisation and a good contribution from Sonamet.  Administrative expenses were $231
million (2008: $254 million) reflecting favourable exchange rate movements and the effect of cost reduction initiatives.  Acergy’s share
of results of associates and joint ventures was $49 million (2008: $63 million) reflecting lower contributions from NKT Flexibles of $22 million (2008: $46 million) due to ongoing challenging market conditions, and Seaway Heavy Lifting of $15
million (2008: $30 million) reflecting a particularly strong contribution from SHL in fiscal year 2008, partially offset by a positive contribution from SapuraAcergy of $10 million (2008: loss of $15 million) due to good project performance and
Sapura3000 being available for the full year allowing higher utilisation.

 The Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the twelve months was 22.1% (2008: 22.7%). The
Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the twelve months was 21.7% (2008: 19.4%).  Income before taxes from continuing operations
for fiscal year 2009 was $361 million (2008: $492 million) reflecting anticipated lower activity levels, particularly in the North Sea and a lower contribution from associates and joint ventures, partly offset by good operational performance across
all regions.  Taxation for the fiscal year was $103 million (2008: $163 million) resulting in an effective tax rate for the full year of 28%
(2008: 33%) reflecting the current geographical portfolio mix of our business and partly offset by a net provision release relating to the resolution of a number of ongoing audits.  Income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $259 million (2008: $330 million). Net income from total operations for fiscal year 2009 was $266 million (2008: $307 million).  The cash and cash equivalents position at the year end was $908 million (2008: $573 million) due to strong operational cash generation. Deferred revenue at
the year end stood at $280 million (2008: $306 million).  At November 30, 2009 Acergy S.A. held directly 10,867,809 treasury shares
representing 5.57% of the total number of issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares. Total shares in issue were 194,953,972, including treasury shares. 
The Board proposes to increase the dividend by 5% to $0.23 per share (2008: $0.22 per share), subject to shareholder approval at the 2010 Annual General
Meeting.  Backlog  Backlog
for continuing operations as at November 30, 2009 was approximately $2.8 billion, of which approximately $1.7 billion is expected to be executed in the fiscal year 2010. This backlog figure does not include the backlog relating to associates
and joint ventures.

(2)
Pre-backlog reflects the stated value of letters of intent and the expected value of escalations on frame agreements  Trading Outlook  We have good visibility
for 2010 with $1.7 billion of revenue already in hand. This supports our guidance for fiscal year 2010 namely for continuing operations, we expect to deliver revenue in line with 2009, albeit with a lower Adjusted EBITDA margin.  We have seen a recent increase in tendering activity, most particularly in the UK North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, but the pricing environment continues to
be very competitive.  This year, we anticipate more activity in the Conventional market in West Africa and we are also encouraged that certain
major SURF contracts, delayed during 2009, are expected to come to market award. The offshore installation phase of most of these projects is expected to commence from late 2011 onwards, and given their size are likely to contribute to substantial
industry growth in the medium-term.  We expect the Conventional market in West Africa to remain very strong and believe the trend will be for
SURF projects to continue to increase in size and complexity. Acergy is well placed to combine our competitive strengths of high calibre engineering and project management skills with our high quality assets to capture these future growth
opportunities.   ***********************************************************************************************************  Acergy S.A. is a

 (a) Adjusted EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA
from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted
to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use in the European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our
various regions, as they eliminate the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts
following the Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary
adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the
Group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity. The reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from
continuing operations is included in this release. This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation
and impairment charges on property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly
titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per
methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations.  Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use of words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”,
“project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the approximate value of the awarded contracts, continued commercial
negotiations relating to the Marathon Volund Project, the timing of the final completion and operational delivery of the Acergy Borealis, the impact on earnings resulting from the fire on the Acergy Falcon, expectations regarding our
backlog and pre-backlog, and statements contained in the “Trading Outlook” section, including our visibility for 2010, the anticipation of increased activity in the conventional market in West Africa, the anticipation that delayed major
SURF contracts will come to market and the timing of the offshore installation phase of such projects, the increase in tendering activity in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the expectation that the conventional market in West Africa will
remain very strong in the medium-term, the expectation for SURF contracts to increase in size and complexity in the medium-term and our ability to capture future growth opportunities. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and
assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future
results and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship
with significant clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries; uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion
programmes; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements.

•
For the three months ended November 30, 2009 the effect of inclusion of the convertible loan note is to reduce the diluted EPS from $0.41 to $0.40. This is said to
be dilutive and is therefore included in the calculation. 


•
For the twelve months ended November 30, 2009 the effect of inclusion of the convertible loan note would be to increase the diluted EPS from $1.33 to $1.34. This
is said to be anti-dilutive and is therefore not included in the calculation.
