News Release  
ALEXCO RECEIVES BALANCE OF ASSAYS FROM ONEK ZINC–SILVER
DEPOSIT; INDIUM ASSOCIATION CONFIRMED  
November 1, 2010 -- Alexco Resource Corp. (TSX:AXR,
NYSE-AMEX:AXU) (“Alexco” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the
balance of results from its 2010 core drilling program in the Onek historical
mine area, Keno Hill Silver District in Canada’s Yukon Territory. Exploration
and infill drilling in the area of the historical Onek underground and open pit
mine continues to confirm that significant widths of indium-bearing zinc-silver
and silver-zinc mineralization extends at least 400 meters along strike, 220
meters down dip, and remains open to the southwest and down plunge. Although not
yet drilled off, the Onek deposit is emerging as a distinctly zoned body, with
high silver grades in the upper portion of the deposit and zinc-indium rich
mineralization at depth. A resource estimation for the Onek deposit is underway
while drilling is ongoing. 
Highlights 
Complete and partial assay results have been received for all
20 holes drilled in the area of the historical Onek mine, located in the eastern
part of the Keno Hill district. Initial results from 18 of the 20 holes were
reported in the news release dated October 6, 2010 entitled “Alexco Intersects
10.4 Meters of 44.3 Ounces per Ton Silver, Expands Onek Zinc-Silver Deposit at
Keno Hill”. Additional results now received include the following: 


  
    
       
    DDH K10-240 cut an interval grading: 303.2 grams per
      tonne silver (8.8 ounces per ton), 0.802 grams per tonne gold, 2.27%
      lead, 20.75% zinc and 535 parts per million indium over 3.52 meters from
      24.99 to 28.51 meters, within a broader zone grading 118.0 grams per
      tonne silver (3.4 ounces per ton), 0.589 grams per tonne gold, 0.86%
      lead, 11.20% zinc and 258 parts per million indium over 11.38 meters from
      24.99 to 36.37 meters. 
  
     
     
     
  
    
       
    DDH K10-265 cut an interval grading: 229.6 grams per
      tonne silver (6.7 ounces per ton), 0.639 grams per tonne gold, 4.40%
      lead, 15.03% zinc and 155 parts per million indium over 4.97 meters from
      66.93 to 71.90 meters. 
  
     
     
     
  
    
       
    DDH K10-239 cut an interval grading: 142.8 grams per
      tonne silver (4.2 ounces per ton), 0.828 grams per tonne gold, 0.36%
      lead, 2.92% zinc and 701 parts per million indium over 5.12 meters from
      16.30 to 21.42 meters. 
  
     
     
     
  
    
       
    DDH K10-241 cut an interval grading: 397.4 grams per
      tonne silver (11.6 ounces per ton), 0.556 grams per tonne gold, 3.18%
      lead, 22.30% zinc and 231 parts per million indium over 0.93 meters from
      90.06 to 90.99 meters. 
These additional drill results continue to confirm the presence
of high-grade zinc-silver-lead and local gold and indium mineralization in the
area of the historical Onek mine, as first reported in the news release of
October 6, 2010. Building on past drilling results and historical information,
it has become clear that mineralization at Onek is strongly zoned, with higher
silver-to-zinc ratios prevalent in the upper portion of the deposit and
predominately zinc rich material, including indium, down dip. The 2010 drill
program at Onek was designed to primarily test the upper, more silver-rich
mineralization as defined in the historical resource by the property’s former
owner, United Keno Hill Mines Limited (“UKHM”) and to better delineate the
transition from silver rich to zinc dominated mineralization identified in earlier drill programs conducted
by Alexco in 2007 and 2008 (see news release dated September 6, 2007 entitled
“Alexco Announces Discovery of High Grade Zinc Mineralization with Silver at
Onek Deposit Located Near the Bellekeno Historic Mine Area; Keno Hill District”
and news release dated July 2, 2008 entitled “Alexco Announces Initial 2008
Drill Results at Keno Hill: Exploration and Infill Drilling at Onek Prospect
Confirms Zinc-Silver Mineralization”).

Anomalous indium mineralization is commonly associated with the
Onek zinc-silver mineralized zones. Pulp samples of mineralized intercepts from
36 of the 42 Alexco 2007 and 2008 Onek drill holes were previously submitted for
indium analysis to Acme Labs of Vancouver, B.C. Of the 36 drill holes, 25
contain significant indium grades, based on a minimum of 1.0 meters of at least
50 parts per million indium. These intercepts include 5.71 meters grading 430
ppm indium (DDH K-08-152; 225.55 to 226.60 meters), 5.50 meters grading 415 ppm
indium (DDH K-07-069; 161.20 to 166.70 meters) and 1.29 meters grading 773 ppm
indium (DDH K-08-134; 207.73 to 209.02 meters). 
Onek Drilling, Production and Historical Resource 
The 2010 Onek drilling, covering a strike length in excess of
400 meters along the Onek structural zone, has confirmed an upper, silver-rich
zone of mineralization and a lower zinc rich zone within and adjacent to the
historical Onek mine where reported past production totaled 93,000 tons
averaging 13.77 ounces per ton silver, 5.54% lead and 3.43% zinc. An historical
resource estimate for the area encompassing the existing underground workings
was calculated by the staff of UKHM in approximately 1997. This historical
resource estimate, including proven, probable and inferred mineralization,
totals 85,734 tons grading 12.63 ounces per ton silver, 4.71% lead, 16.41% zinc
and 0.01 ounces per ton gold. Although believed by Alexco management to be
relevant and reliable, this historical resource estimate pre-dates National
Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) and is not compliant with NI 43-101 resource
categories. Alexco plans to complete an interim NI 43-101 compliant resource
estimate from data collected from Onek through October 2010, primarily to rank
the deposit as part of an ongoing district-wide strategic development plan. The
importance of the Onek deposit is enhanced by its proximity to the newly
constructed Bellekeno mill, ease of underground access, and the identification
of newly defined areas of the deposit with significant silver credits.
Additionally, the deposit remains open to the southwest and down dip. 
An updated composite table listing those Onek 2010 drill holes
having complete and partial assay results is available for review along with a
drill hole location map on the Company website at www.alexcoresource.com. 
Notes 
True widths have not yet been determined for the above reported
drill intercepts. 
The 2010 exploration drill program and sampling protocol has
been reviewed, verified and compiled by Alexco’s geologic staff under the
oversight of Stan Dodd, Vice President, Exploration for Alexco and a Qualified
Person as defined by NI 43-101. A rigorous quality control and quality assurance
protocol is used on the project, including blank, duplicate and standard
reference samples in each batch of 20 samples that were delivered to the lab.
All drill core samples were shipped to Agat Labs at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory
for preparation, with fire assay and multi-element ICP analyses done at Agat
Labs facility at Mississauga, Ontario. The scientific and technical information
about Alexco’s mineral projects contained in this news release has also been
reviewed and verified by Mr. Dodd.

Continued 2010 District Exploration 
Alexco continues exploration work at Keno Hill, including a
second phase drill program at Onek. Currently there are five surface core
drills, one underground core drill and one reverse circulation drill operating
throughout the district. Other properties/areas seeing continued exploration
include Bellekeno, Bermingham, Flame & Moth, Galkeno and the McQuesten
Valley. Additional surface core drilling is also planned for the Elsa/Husky and
Silver King areas later this year. The Keno Hill exploration program is
currently projected to continue in to the winter, and a decision will be made in
November or December regarding the number of drills to be retained for
continuing winter-spring operations in 2011. 
Keno Hill Silver District History 
Between 1921 and 1988, the Keno Hill Silver District produced
more than 217 million ounces of silver with average grades of 40.5 ounces per
ton silver, 5.6% lead and 3.1% zinc (Yukon Government's Minfile database). The
historical production grades would rank Keno Hill in the top 3% by grade of
today's global silver producers. The Keno Hill district is the second-largest
historical silver producer in Canada.
