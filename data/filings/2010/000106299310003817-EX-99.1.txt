    President’s Message 
    
  
     
    
      Our significant successes during the 2009/2010 year have
      been pivotal to the future of your company. First and foremost we have
      delivered on our promise to bring the Bellekeno silver-lead-zinc mine into
      production, establishing Alexco as Canada’s only primary silver producer,
      as well as revitalizing one of the highest grade silver districts in the
      world. To achieve this milestone required the construction of a new 400
      tonne per day conventional flotation mill and development of the Bellekeno
      Mine as well as modification and expansion of all the infrastructure
      required to support a new mining complex. All this was accomplished over a
      nine month period in 2010, the project being delivered on time and
      essentially on budget at the end of September. Permitting for our
      operations was conducted in parallel with the development and construction
      program and was similarly completed as anticipated with the acquisition of
  our key permit, the Type A Water Licence in August of 2010.  

In addition to our busy construction and commissioning
activities, we also embarked on our most ambitious district wide exploration
program since arriving in the district in 2006. By December of 2010 we will have
drilled more than 25,000 meters on the surface and approximately 4,000 meters
underground and will have positioned ourselves to calculate new resources in at
least two and possibly three new areas within easy trucking distance of our new
mill. This program has also given rise to a number of discoveries, added to our
burgeoning geological knowledge, and set the stage for potential development of
additional mines in the district.
As I write this letter in November, 2010, we have already
completed the mechanical and electrical commissioning of the mine and mill
complex, and are successfully producing our first lead and zinc concentrates.
Notably, our new mill also is designed to produce (non-commercial) pyrite
concentrates to be special-handled both on the surface and underground as part
of the backfill cycle to ensure the highest environmental integrity is
maintained at the new facilities. 
Clearly, Alexco would not been able to achieve production at
Bellekeno in a compressed timeframe without the help of numerous contractors,
vendors, and a group of highly dedicated and hard working employees. But we
always had a strategy, based on our belief that silver markets would escalate
after 2008, of expediting our path to production by completing early exploration
and engineering work with a bias toward commercial operation. The work we
completed prior to making the production decision in the fourth quarter of 2009,
notably driving a production sized decline in the exploration stage and pouring
the concrete mill footings, allowed for a short construction timeline, with mine
start-up ahead of normal industry timelines for project execution. We
complemented fast-track construction with a confident permitting approach that
delivered regulatory approvals in step with project requirements, underscoring
our conviction that Yukon is a competitive jurisdiction in which to conduct
business.
The financing arrangement reached with Silver Wheaton in 2008
provided the capital necessary to develop the Bellekeno deposit without
materially diluting shareholder equity. The arrangement has worked smoothly and
we are appreciative of the responsive business approach and continuing support
provided by Silver Wheaton, with whom we expect to enjoy a long relationship.

Alexco’s environmental services business continued to perform
well in 2009/2010. Our US business is expanding, and our Canadian office
continues to provide key service and support to a wide variety of industry and
government clients. One of the reasons we were able to permit the Bellekeno Mine
in a timely manner was the fact that we utilized our expert in-house
environmental services team to permit the project. As a result, we confidently
constructed the mine and mill and related facilities in tandem with permitting
stages, enabling fast-track project execution in a modern environmental
regulatory regime. The environmental services business is also entering a more
robust phase as our reclamation activities at Keno Hill ramp up, and are
scheduled to ramp up considerably more next year. 







I am pleased to report that our share price has now fully recovered from the impact of the financial crisis of late 2008. At this time last year, spot silver prices were around US$17.50 per ounce and our share price was still 35% below its
average of $4.63 over our fiscal 2008. Today, with spot silver prices running at US$26 and following the successful construction of the Bellekeno mine, Alexco's shares trade well above $6. Our capital structure remains sensible,
and our balance sheet is strong. Bellekeno is coming into production at a time when silver prices are the highest seen in years, and the success we are seeing from our 2010 drilling program underscores the tremendous exploration potential of the
Keno Hill district. With our superior assets and proven management team, combined with the strategic advantage we hold through our environmental services business, I firmly believe that Alexco is uniquely positioned within the mining sector to
continue delivering strong growth and value to our shareholders. 

We are also pleased to report that we successfully concluded a Comprehensive Cooperation and Benefits Agreement with the First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun (NND). This agreement heralds a strong relationship between Alexco and the NND, who see us as we
see them  -   good neighbors and partners who stand to mutually benefit for a long time to come. We believe the Agreement is one of our major assets, providing for a transparent and cooperative approach to future project permitting, employment
and contracting at the Bellekeno mine, and our future activities throughout the district. 

The success we have enjoyed this year bodes well for the sustained future of our company, and none of it could have been realized without a strong team of talented employees all working towards the same goal. We would like to thank our shareholders
for your continued support; your obvious confidence in us drives us forward.

Overall Performance 
During the year ended June 30, 2010, Alexco made significant
progress in the construction and development of the Bellekeno underground mine
and ore processing facility, located in the Keno Hill silver district in
Canada’s Yukon Territory. The construction and development project was formally
initiated in November 2009 following completion of a favourable Development Plan
for the Bellekeno mine. As at June 30, 2010, approximately $20.7 million in
Bellekeno mine construction and development capital expenditures had been
incurred since the initiation of construction activity. By July 31, 2010, such
incurred construction and development capital expenditures totaled approximately
$24.9 million, and on a physical basis, mine development was approximately 81%
complete while mill construction was approximately 68% complete. Total actual
construction and development capital to achieve production is currently forecast
by the Corporation to be $43.1 million, a variance of 3.6% from the original
Development Plan estimate, and the overall project remains essentially on
schedule and on budget for completion and the start of commissioning by the end
of the third quarter of calendar 2010. 
In March 2010, Alexco initiated its calendar 2010 exploration
program at its Keno Hill properties, with major areas of focus including the
historical mine areas of Silver King, Lucky Queen, Onek and Flame and Moth as
well as “new” target areas including the McQuesten valley. As at June 30, 2010,
approximately 6,100 meters had been drilled from surface under the 2010 program,
with work expected to continue well into the fall. In May 2010, Alexco announced
an initial indicated resource estimate for the historical Elsa tailings, another
of its properties in the Keno Hill district. 







In its environmental consulting services business, Alexco recognized revenues of $4,641,000 during the 2010 fiscal year compared to $5,818,000 for fiscal 2009.  Gross profit for the 2010 fiscal year was $1,771,000, compared to
$389,000 for fiscal 2009.  The fiscal 2009 gross profit is net of a contract loss provision totaling $1,150,000 for estimated future losses from care and maintenance activities in the Keno Hill district under the Subsidiary Agreement (see
" Results of Operations  -   Consulting Services" ), while the fiscal 2010 gross profit includes a $237,000 gain from a favourable re-assessment of that estimated loss provision. Excluding the impact of these provision amounts,
gross margins were 33.1% over fiscal 2010 compared to 26.5% in 2009. 

Alexco completed two financings during fiscal 2010, issuing 2,375,000 flow-through common shares in December 2009 by way of private placement at a price of $4.00 per share and issuing 7,350,000 common shares in February 2010 under a short form
prospectus at a price of $3.50 per share, generating total cash proceeds of $33,091,000, net of after-tax issuance costs. Also during fiscal 2010, Alexco commenced drawing against the remaining US$35 million deposit amount due under the
silver purchase agreement with Silver Wheaton Corp. (" Silver Wheaton" ). Intended to fund the Bellekeno mine development and construction costs, through June 30, 2010 Alexco had received a total of US$11,899,000 (C$12,172,000) of
the remaining deposit amount, with the remaining US$23,101,000 to be received in monthly draw-down payments over the balance of the Bellekeno mine development and construction period. 

The Corporation's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2010 totaled $24,383,000 compared to $10,045,000 at June 30, 2009, while net working capital totaled $20,669,000 compared to $10,484,000 for the same dates respectively.
Substantially all of the increase in cash and cash equivalents and net working capital is attributable to the December 2009 and February 2010 equity financings, net of capital expenditures, primarily with respect to the Bellekeno mine development
and construction and the Keno Hill district exploration activity, the net cash outflow from operating activities and the timing difference in the inflow and outflow of Silver Wheaton deposit funds reflected under restricted cash and deposits. 

Results of Operations 

Keno Hill Silver District 

Substantially all of the Corporation's exploration and development activities during the year ended June 30, 2010 have been conducted on its Keno Hill silver district properties.  The Keno Hill silver district is located in Yukon Territory
approximately 330 kilometers north of Whitehorse in the vicinity of the villages of Mayo and Keno City and lies within the traditional territory of the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun (" FNNND" ). In June 2010, the Corporation entered into
a comprehensive cooperation and benefits agreement with the FNNND, setting out common understandings, obligations and opportunities arising from all of the Corporation's activities within the Keno Hill district including exploration, care and
maintenance, district closure activities and mine production. This agreement builds on a framework established previously under negotiation and cooperation agreements entered into during 2007 and 2008. 
 The Corporation's Keno Hill properties consist of approximately
  24,300 hectares of mining leases, quartz claims and crown grants containing
  numerous occurrences of mineral deposits and prospects, including over 30 historical
  mines. The Yukon Government's published Minfile database states that between
  1941 and 1989, the Keno Hill district produced more than 217 million ounces
  of silver with average grades of 40.52 ounces per ton silver, 5.62% lead and
  3.14% zinc. Mine operations closed down in 1989 when United Keno Hill Mines
  Limited put the district on care and maintenance in the face of rising costs
  and environmental regulatory pressures. The majority of the Corporation's mineral
  property interests within the Keno Hill district were purchased from the interim
  receiver of United Keno Hill Mines Limited and UKH Minerals Limited (collectively,
  "UKHM"). 

Bellekeno Property 

A significant component of the Corporation's exploration and development activities in the Keno Hill district have been focused on the Bellekeno historical mine area, and in a news release dated November 11, 2009 entitled " Alexco
Completes Positive Bellekeno Mine Development Plan, Silver Wheaton Concurs  -   Initiation of Construction Approved" , Alexco announced the completion of a positive Development Plan for the Bellekeno mine.  The Development Plan incorporates
the terms of Alexco's agreement with Silver Wheaton, and outlines a project with a pre-tax net present value to Alexco of $31.9 million over an initial mine life of approximately four years.  Silver Wheaton provided Alexco with written
confirmation of their acceptance that the Development Plan is favourable, and Alexco's board of directors authorized the initiation of construction activity. 




The Development Plan is a comprehensive study describing the
proposed mining methods and proposed mineral processing methods, as well as
expected metallurgical recoveries, engineering design of mill and mine
facilities, permitting requirements, environmental impacts and other factors
relevant to the construction and operation of the proposed mine. The Plan
encompasses an updated mineral resource estimate for Bellekeno on which the
proposed mining plan is based, as well as an economic analysis of the project.

The pre-tax results of the economic analysis of the project are
summarized as follows:

      Based on metal prices of US$14.04 per ounce for silver,
      US$813 per ounce for gold, US$0.94 per pound for lead and US$1.10 per
      pound for zinc and a USD/CAD exchange rate of $0.91, representing
      three-year historical averages as reported from the London Metal Exchange
      and the Bank of Canada.
  
    4. 
    
      Based on metal prices of US$13.50 per ounce for silver,
      US$800 per ounce for gold, US$0.90 per pound for lead and US$0.90 per
      pound for zinc and a USD/CAD exchange rate of $0.92, representing metal
      prices and currency exchange assumed by Wardrop Engineering
  Inc.
The economic analysis reflects 25% of the silver production
being sold to Silver Wheaton at US$3.90 per ounce, in accordance with the silver
purchase agreement. 
Under the Development Plan’s base case scenario, average net
smelter return over the life of mine (“LOM”) is estimated at $458 per tonne
mined, including $535 per tonne mined over the first two years. Average
operating costs over the LOM are estimated to be $287 per tonne mined, including
mining, milling, general and administrative costs and royalty payments, yielding
an LOM operating margin of $171 per tonne, with average operating costs over the
first two years estimated to be C$287 yielding an operating margin of C$248.
Accounting for mining dilution and recovery, a total of 321,941 tonnes
containing an estimated 871 grams per tonne silver, 9.5% lead and 5.6% zinc are
included in the current LOM mining plan. Processing will utilize a standard lead
and zinc differential flotation process incorporating dry stack tailings
technology, with the processing plant carrying a design capacity of 408 tonnes
per day. Mining and milling operations will be carried out year-round at a
base-plan production rate of 250 tonnes per day, with mining carried out by a
mining contractor using predominantly cut-and-fill mining methods augmented with
some minor shrink stoping to optimize high grade mineralization extraction and
reduce dilution. Mined-out stopes will be backfilled with a cemented blend of
development waste rock and the pyritic component of dry filtered tailings
backhauled from the processing plant. 
As of November 2009, the total construction and development
capital to achieve commercial production was estimated in the Development Plan
to be $41.6 million, including a contingency factor of approximately 16%. Of
this, US$35 million (CAD$38.0 million at an assumed exchange rate of $0.92) will
be funded by Silver Wheaton under its silver purchase agreement with Alexco.
These Silver Wheaton funds will be received on a monthly draw-down basis subject
to certain conditions including Alexco having sufficient committed funds
available to complete construction and achieve production within specified time
frames. The primary condition to draw-down under the silver purchase agreement
was the delivery to Silver Wheaton of the Development Plan and their acceptance
that it was favourable, and this condition has now been met.

      The effective date of this resource estimate is November
      9, 2009.
The updated resource estimate has been determined using a
three-dimensional block model constrained by wireframe, integrating underground
chip sample and drill core data for all three resource zones (Southwest, 99 and
East). The drilling database includes 7,333 meters of underground diamond
drilling in 132 holes as well as 1,666 meters of surface diamond drilling
carried out during 2009 to infill the shallower portions of the East and 99
zones, plus approximately 10,277 meters of surface diamond drilling completed by
Alexco prior to 2009. Also during 2009, underground geologic mapping was
undertaken at multiple points in the historical workings, focused on structure
and mineralization as well as hangingwall and footwall lithologies. Following
geostatistical analysis and variography, metal grades were estimated separately
into block models for each zone using an inverse distance squared methodology.
All data has been verified and validated by Alexco in accordance with Canadian
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) Estimation of Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines and with NI 43-101
guidelines. All mineral resources have been estimated following the CIM
Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005),
in accordance with the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
Best Practice Guidelines and with NI 43-101 guidelines. 
The disclosure of scientific and technical information entailed
in the Development Plan is supported by a technical report filed on SEDAR dated
December 2, 2009 and entitled “Bellekeno Project – Updated Preliminary Economic
Assessment Technical Report”. For purposes of NI 43-101, the technical report is
considered an update to the preliminary economic assessment released by Alexco
in July 2008 (see news release dated July 9, 2008 entitled “Alexco Releases
Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment on Bellekeno Deposit, First of Several
Potential Silver Production Opportunities in the Keno Hill Silver District”) and
the resource estimate released in January 2008 (see news release dated January
30, 2008 entitled “Alexco Outlines New Zinc-Silver Zone at Bellekeno and Updates
Resource Estimate”). The proposed mining plan and economic analysis under the
Development Plan are based entirely on indicated resources. The Development Plan
and supporting technical report have been prepared by an integrated team of
personnel from Alexco, Wardrop Engineering Inc. (“Wardrop”) and SRK Consulting
(Canada) Inc. (“SRK”). The updated mineral resource estimate for Bellekeno has
been prepared by Alexco under the responsibility of Stan Dodd, L.Geo., Vice
President, Exploration and Vince Scartozzi, L.Geo., Chief Mine Geologist, with
the analysis of specific gravity and variography performed by SRK under the
responsibility of G. David Keller, P.Geo. The mining plan has been prepared by
SRK, with geotechnical study and design and the ground control management plan
prepared under the responsibility of Bruce Murphy, FSAIMM, and mine design and
estimation of minable resources prepared under the responsibility of Ken Reipas,
P.Eng. All other components of the Development Plan and technical report,
including design and costing of infrastructure, mineral processing and the
economic analysis, have been prepared by Wardrop under the responsibility of
Hassan Ghaffari, P.Eng. G. David Keller, Bruce Murphy, Ken Reipas and Hassan
Ghaffari are Independent of Alexco as defined by NI 43-101. 







Bellekeno Mine Construction and Development Project Status 

As at June 30, 2010, approximately $20.7 million in Bellekeno mine construction and development capital expenditures had been incurred since the initiation of construction activity.  By July 31, 2010 such capital expenditures totaled
approximately $24.9 million, and on a physical basis, mine development, including underground mine services and mine-related surface infrastructure, was approximately 81% complete while mill construction was approximately 68% complete. Total
actual construction and development capital to achieve production is currently forecast by the Corporation to be $43.1 million, a negative variance of 3.6% from the original Development Plan estimate.  The overall project remains essentially on
schedule and on budget for completion and the start of commissioning by the end of the third quarter of calendar 2010. 

In February 2009, Alexco filed its Bellekeno mine project proposal under the Yukon Environmental and Socioeconomic Assessment Act (Canada) (" YESAA" ). The filing and consequential evaluation of the project proposal under YESAA was
part of the regulatory process governing the eventual issuance of the Quartz Mining License and Type A Water Use License, being the primary permits required to commence commercial operations at the Bellekeno mine. The YESAA recommendation report was
received in June 2009, and in July the Yukon Government issued a positive decision document agreeing with the recommendation of the YESAA report that the Bellekeno project should proceed. Based on this decision document, the Yukon Government issued
a Quartz Mining License for the Bellekeno mine in November 2009. The Corporation's application for a Type A Water Use Licence was submitted and declared adequate by the Yukon Water Board, and following further deliberation and a public hearing
in June 2010, a Type A Water Use Licence for Bellekeno operation was issued in August. 

Other Keno Hill District Properties Including Elsa Tailings 

Surface drilling within the Keno Hill district under the summer 2009 exploration program commenced in June, initially with two diamond drills and then a third added in August, and comprised a total of 7,930 meters of drilling including those drilled
in the Bellekeno area as noted above. At the Lucky Queen property, a total of 12 holes were drilled along strike and down plunge of prior identified high grade mineralization, the results from which were disclosed in news releases dated October 15,
2009 entitled " Alexco Announces Additional 2009 Drill Results at Keno Hill: Drilling at Lucky Queen Intersects 1.35 meters of 202.3 Ounces per Ton Silver" , and November 3, 2009 entitled " Alexco Announces Additional 2009 Drill
Results from Lucky Queen, Keno Hill District: Drilling Intersects 4.23 meters of 61.8 Ounces per Ton Silver" . 

Other drilling included previously untested covered targets located approximately 450 meters along strike from the Keno 700 gold-enriched deposit, testing of the Bermingham area along strike of the historical Hector Calumet mine, and drilling in the
area of the historical Silver King mine. Initial results from the Keno 700 drilling were disclosed in a news release dated November 5, 2009 entitled " Alexco Announces Additional 2009 Drill Results, Keno Hill District, Yukon: Keno 700 Drilling
Intersects 1.03 Meters of 18.48 g/t Gold" , while results from the Silver King drilling were disclosed in a news release dated December 1, 2009 entitled " Alexco Announces Additional 2009 Drill Results, Keno Hill District, Yukon: Silver
King Drilling Intersects 2.55 Meters of 56.4 Ounces per Ton Silver" .  Results from the drilling at Birmingham were disclosed in a news release dated December 15, 2009 entitled " Alexco Identifies 20 Meter Wide Mineralized Structural Zone
at Bermingham, Keno Hill Silver District, Yukon" . 

In March 2010, Alexco initiated its calendar 2010 exploration program at its Keno Hill properties.  Major areas of focus for the 2010 surface program are the Silver King, Lucky Queen, Onek and Flame and Moth historical mine areas, as well as new
targets within the district that are not directly associated with former mines and have been identified as a result of work done on regional stratigraphy and correlation of structural observations. As of June 30, 2010, a total of 6,100 meters had
been drilled under this program, primarily at Silver King and Onek.  The 2010 surface exploration program costs are being funded by the proceeds from the $9.5 million flow-through financing completed in December 2009.  Separately, a program of
further exploration drilling was initiated underground at Bellekeno to further expand the Bellekeno mineable resources, and as of June 30, 2010 a total of 1,690 meters had been drilled under this program with particular focus on the lower Bellekeno
East Zone inferred resource. 

In addition to diamond drilling in 2009, a sonic drill was mobilized to the Keno Hill district in September 2009 and completed 283 holes sampling the historical tailings located adjacent to the Elsa town site. As reported in the news release dated
May 6, 2010 entitled " Alexco Announces Initial Elsa Tailings Resource Estimate, Keno Hill" , an initial indicated resource estimate in respect of the Elsa tailings has now been completed by SRK as follows:

Notes:



  
    1. 
    
      Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not
      have demonstrated economic viability. All figures have been rounded to
      reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates.
  
    2. 
    
      Includes all blocks in the block model and effectively
      reported at a cut-off of 50 grams per tonne silver as all material is
      potentially economic assuming metal prices of US$17 per troy ounce silver
      and US$1,000 per troy ounce gold, silver recovery of 85% and gold recovery
      of 35%. Lead and zinc values not considered.
  
    3. 
    
      The effective date of this resource estimate is April 22,
      2010.
Based on historical records, it is estimated that approximately
4.05 million short tons (3.67 million tonnes) of tailings were deposited at the
Elsa site, captured mainly in the current existing impoundment and occupying an
areal extent of approximately 100 hectares. The phase one program of 283
vertical holes totaled 910 meters on a 50 meter grid spanning approximately 77
hectares, and a phase two program is under consideration to focus on the
remaining impoundment area. The average thickness of tailings drilled in phase
one is 2.3 meters, ranging from a maximum thickness of 7.5 meters to a minimum
of 0.2 meters. Studies to assess tailings process alternatives and preliminary
economics have been initiated, including metallurgical recovery tests through
Kappes Cassiday & Associates. It is the opinion of SRK that, given
completion of metallurgical test work appropriate to evaluate processing
options, resources for the Elsa tailings project have been defined to sufficient
accuracy to support the preparation of a preliminary economic assessment. 
The Elsa tailings resource estimate is supported by a technical
report filed on SEDAR dated June 16, 2010 and entitled “Mineral Resource
Estimation, Elsa Tailings Project, Yukon, Canada”. The estimate has been
prepared by SRK under the responsibility of G. David Keller, P.Geo., an
Independent Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, in conformity with
generally accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best
Practices Guidelines. The resource estimate may be affected by further infill
and exploration drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent
resource estimates. The resource estimate may also be affected by subsequent
assessments of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation,
socio-economic and other factors. 
Brewery Creek Property 
In August 2009, the Corporation entered into an option
agreement with a third party under which the third party has been granted
exclusive rights to earn up to a 75% interest in the Brewery Creek property
other than with respect to barite deposits, and earn a 50% interest in any
barite deposits located on the property. The third party can earn the full 75%
interest in the property excluding barite deposits by incurring aggregate
non-barite-related exploration and development expenditures of at least $6
million and completing a non-barite bankable feasibility study by December 31,
2014. If the third party earns its full 75% interest, the Corporation will have
a one-time option to claw back a 10% interest by paying a cash amount equal to
2.5 times the third party’s non-Barite related expenditures in excess of $4
million. The third party can earn the 50% barite interest by incurring $1
million in barite-related exploration expenditures by December 31, 2012, subject
to the condition that it has also incurred at least $3.5 million in expenditures
towards the non-barite interest. 
Consulting Services 
Under its Alexco Environmental Group division, the Corporation
operates an environmental consulting business providing a range of services to
the mining industry and other clients. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries,
Access Mining Consultants Ltd. (“Access”), Alexco Resource U.S. Corp. and, with
respect to services provided in the Keno Hill district, Elsa Reclamation &
Development Company Ltd. (“ERDC”), the Corporation provides management of the
regulatory and environmental permitting process, environmental assessments and
reclamation and closure planning. The Corporation also owns certain patent
rights allowed and pending related to mine reclamation and closure processes
including the in situ immobilization of metals in groundwater, soils, waste
stacks and pit lakes. 







Consulting group revenues were $4,641,000 during the 2010 fiscal year compared to $5,818,000 during 2009. The decline is attributed primarily to the impact of the annual 15% reduction in fees billable under the Subsidiary Agreement for care
and maintenance activities (see below) combined with reduced closure reclamation activity during fiscal 2010 within the district under the Subsidiary Agreement. Consulting costs during fiscal 2010 totaled $2,870,000 compared to $5,429,000
during 2009, resulting in a gross profit for fiscal 2010 of $1,771,000 compared to $389,000 in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2009 consulting costs include a contract loss provision totaling $1,150,000 for estimated future losses from care and
maintenance activities in the Keno Hill district under the Subsidiary Agreement, while the fiscal 2010 consulting costs include a $237,000 gain from a favourable re-assessment of that estimated loss provision. Excluding the impact of these
provision amounts, gross profit was $1,534,000 over fiscal 2010 compared to $1,539,000 in 2009, and gross margins were 33.1% over fiscal 2010 compared to 26.5% in 2009 with the increase due primarily to high profit margins generated on
revenues of $264,000 from the sale of sludge recovered from a remediation project. 

As part of the Corporation's acquisition of its original property interests in the Keno Hill district, ERDC entered into an agreement (the " Subsidiary Agreement" ) with the Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon
(collectively, " Government" ). Under the Subsidiary Agreement, ERDC is retained by Government as a paid contractor responsible on a continuing basis for the environmental care and maintenance and ultimate closure reclamation of the former
UKHM properties. The Subsidiary Agreement provides that ERDC is responsible for the development of the ultimate closure reclamation plan for fees of 65% of agreed commercial contractor rates, and this plan development is currently ongoing. Upon
acceptance and regulatory approval, the closure reclamation plan will be implemented by ERDC at full negotiated contractor rates. During the period required to develop the plan, ERDC is also responsible for carrying out the environmental care and
maintenance at various sites within the UKHM properties, for a fixed annual fee adjusted each year for certain operating and inflationary factors and determined on a site-by-site basis. The portion of the annual fee amount so determined which is
billable by ERDC in respect of each site will reduce by 15% each year until all site-specific care and maintenance activities have been replaced by closure reclamation activities; provided however that should a closure reclamation plan be prepared
but not accepted and approved, the portion of annual fees billable by ERDC will revert to 85% until the Subsidiary Agreement is either amended or terminated. ERDC receives agreed commercial contractor rates when retained by government to provide
consulting services in the Keno Hill district outside the scope of the Sub-Agreement. 

General, Administration and Corporate 

Excluding write-downs for goodwill, intangible assets and mineral properties, general and administrative expenses during year ended June 30, 2010 were $8,578,000, compared to $7,447,000 in 2009.  The increase is attributed primarily to
increased costs for salaries and contractors, partially offset by reduced costs for professional fees as well as lower amortization of property, plant and equipment. 

Expenses for salaries and contractors totaled $4,890,000 and $2,819,000 for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively, and include stock-based compensation expenses of $980,000 and $561,000 respectively. In recognition of the transition of
the Bellekeno mine project to the construction and development phase, the Corporation incurred increased costs in respect of awards to staff of both stock based compensation and cash incentive bonuses as well as general salary increases.  The amount
of amortization of property, plant and equipment included in general, administration and corporate expenses has decreased due primarily to a larger proportion of amortization being capitalized to both mineral properties and the Bellekeno ore
processing mill under construction, as well as a portion being recorded in consulting costs for fiscal 2010. 

Interest income was $88,000 for the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to $224,000 in 2009.  Interest income varies by period depending on the Corporation's average balances of cash, cash equivalents and deposits on hand through the
period and on prevailing market yields on the bankers’ acceptances and term deposits in which the Corporation's funds are generally invested. 

Outlook 

With respect to Bellekeno and as discussed above, the mine development and construction project is currently in progress with mill commissioning scheduled to be initiated by the end of the third quarter of calendar 2010.  The Corporation anticipates
that the commissioning and production ramp-up phase will be completed and commercial production formally declared to have been achieved during the second half of calendar 2010. 

With respect to the economic climate, prices for silver, lead and zinc, being the primary metals found in the Bellekeno resource in particular and within the Keno Hill district historically, have remained generally strong through most of the 









past 12 months, and consensus analyst commodity price forecasts remain cautiously optimistic. Spot prices as at the date of this MD&A are approximately US$20.79 per ounce silver, US$0.99 per pound for lead and US$0.96 per pound for
zinc and the Canadian-US exchange rate is approximately US$0.97 per CAD. Based on a consensus of current analyst commodity price forecasts, over the next two calendar years silver prices are forecast to be in the range of US$17.75 to
US$18.50 per ounce, lead prices are forecast to be in the range of US$0.83 to US$0.90 per pound and zinc prices are forecast to be in approximately US$0.90 per pound, with the Canadian-US exchange rate forecast at approximately
US$0.97 to US$0.98 per CAD.  These forecasts generally compare favourably to the assumptions contained in the Development Plan.  Nonetheless, the Corporation remains exposed to development risk with respect to Bellekeno, particularly until
commercial production has been formally declared and the mine's production ramp-up has been completed. Such risks include but are not limited to adverse changes in the estimated capital (construction and sustaining) and operating costs of the
mine, local geotechnical risks in the underground operation and the ability to achieve targeted recovery rates through the ore processing mill. 

Under the 2010 Keno Hill exploration program, as of the date of this MD&A a total of approximately 13,800 meters of drilling from surface has been completed across the district and the program remains ongoing with surface drilling expected to
continue into fall. Major areas of focus for the 2010 surface program to date have been the Silver King, Lucky Queen, Onek and Flame and Moth historical mine areas, and the program over the remainder of the 2010 exploration season will include new
targets within the district that are not directly associated with former mines and have been identified as a result of work done on regional stratigraphy and correlation of structural observations. Separately, exploration drilling of with respect to
the Bellekeno underground program has totaled approximately 2,600 meters to date with the objective of expanding the Bellekeno mineable resources, with additional follow-up drilling now being planned both from surface and underground. With respect
to the Elsa tailings project, Alexco has initiated studies to assess tailings process alternatives and preliminary economics including metallurgical recovery tests through Kappes Cassiday & Associates. 

With respect to its consulting services division, the Corporation remains engaged in the on-going environmental care and maintenance program and reclamation and closure projects at Keno Hill under its contract through ERDC with Government and in
accordance with the Subsidiary Agreement, and continues to service its private sector client base in the Yukon through Access. Similarly, the Corporation intends to continue expanding its environmental services activities, both in the Yukon and
Northwest Territories in Canada, and in the United States and elsewhere through the Americas.  In January 2010, the Corporation announced the appointment of Mr. Jim Harrington to the position of President of the Alexco Environmental Group, as part
of Alexco's long term strategy to expand its consulting services business. The Corporation notes, however, that growth in its consulting services group will be at least partially offset by continuing declines in the revenue from its care and
maintenance activities under the Subsidiary Agreement during the period required to obtain acceptance and regulatory approval from Government for the Keno Hill district closure reclamation plan. 

Results of Operations  -   Fourth Quarter 

In the fourth quarter of the 2010 fiscal year, the Corporation recorded a net loss of $1,519,000, after consulting revenues of $910,000 and consulting gross profit of $433,000. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in comparison, the
Corporation recorded a net loss of $2,167,000, after consulting revenues of $1,482,000 and consulting gross loss of $646,000. The F2009-Q4 gross loss is net of the recognition of $1,030,000 of the contract loss provision recognized
during that quarter for estimated future losses from care and maintenance activities in the Keno Hill district under the Subsidiary Agreement (see " Results of Operations  -   Consulting Services" ).

The reduced gross margins in F2009-Q2 and F2009-Q4 include
estimated provisions recorded in those quarters for losses under the Subsidiary
Agreement contract of $120,000 and $1,030,000 respectively, and the increased
gross margin in F2010-Q3 includes a gain of $237,000 from a favourable
re-assessment of that estimated provision. The net losses of each of F2009-Q3
and F2010-Q3 reflect costs associated with the Corporation’s annual awards of
cash bonuses and incentive stock option grantings to its employees, including
resultant stock-based compensation expense recognitions of $507,000 and $671,000
respectively. The net loss in F2009-Q2 reflects the impact of increased
professional fees relating to the Silver Wheaton agreement and impairment
write-downs recorded that quarter of $852,000 in respect of intangible assets,
$2,430,000 in respect of the Brewery Creek mineral property and $917,000 in
respect of goodwill, partially offset by future income tax recoveries totaling
$931,000. The increased mineral property expenditures in F2009-Q1 through
F2009-Q4 reflects the commencement of development of the underground decline and
the initiation of the underground drill program at the Bellekeno property. The
increased mineral property expenditures in F2010-Q3 and Q4 reflects the
initiation of the construction and development phase of the Bellekeno mine
project, as well as the commencement of the calendar 2010 exploration program at
the Keno Hill properties. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
At June 30, 2010, the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents
of $24,383,000, and net working capital of $20,669,000. The Corporation has no
investments in asset backed commercial paper and faces no known liquidity issues
in any of its investments. 
Cash used in operating activities was $4,765,000 for the year
ended June 30, 2010, versus $4,679,000 in 2009. Cash used in investing
activities was $25,949,000 for the year ended June 30, 2010, versus $28,996,000
in 2009. Of the cash expended on investing activities in 2010, approximately
$14.3 million pertained to Bellekeno mine development and construction
expenditures, another $1.1 million pertained to the posting of reclamation
security under the Bellekeno mine permits in the form of term deposits held
under safekeeping agreements and which funds are now included in the
Corporation’s non-current restricted cash and deposits, with the remainder
pertaining to exploration activities, general plant and equipment expenditures,
and timing differences between the receipt and expenditure of Silver Wheaton
deposit funds which are recorded in restricted cash and deposits. 
Under the silver purchase agreement with Silver Wheaton, the
Corporation is to receive deposit payments totaling US$50 million, plus a
further payment of the lesser of US$3.90 (increasing by 1% per annum after the
third year of full production) and the prevailing market price for each ounce of
silver delivered. The agreement also provides that prior to meeting an initial
completion test based on production throughput, all deposit payments received
from Silver Wheaton can only be expended on the development and construction of
the Bellekeno mine, being one of the Corporation’s Keno Hill district
properties. 
Under the agreement, the deposit balance is reduced on each
silver delivery by the excess of the prevailing market value of the silver
delivered over the per-ounce cash amount paid by Silver Wheaton at the time.
After the initial 40 







year term of the agreement, the Corporation is required to refund the balance of any deposit payments received and not yet reduced through silver deliveries. The Corporation would also be required to refund the balance of deposit payments received
and not yet reduced if Silver Wheaton exercised its right to terminate the agreement in an event of default by the Corporation, which would include a failure to meet certain Bellekeno mine construction milestones. The Corporation will be required to
refund a pro-rata portion of the balance of the deposit not yet reduced to the extent the Bellekeno mine has not achieved production throughput of 400 tonnes of ore per day by December 31, 2013. 

An initial deposit payment under the agreement of US$15 million (C$18,210,000) was received by the Corporation in December 2008 and recorded in restricted cash and deposits.  The remaining US$35 million is being paid on a monthly
draw-down basis to fund the Bellekeno mine infrastructure and ore processing mill construction costs, subject to certain conditions including the Corporation having sufficient committed funds available to complete construction and achieve production
within specified time frames. As of June 30, 2010, a total of US$11,899,000 (C$12,172,000) of these remaining Silver Wheaton funds had been received. A further US$6,409,000 (C$6,640,000) has since been received since June 30, 2010,
as at the date of this MD&A.

In December 2009, the Corporation issued by way of private placement 2,375,000 flow-through common shares on a brokered basis at $4.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $9,500,000. Net proceeds from the issuance were $8,865,000,
after issuance costs comprised of the agents’ commission of $557,000 and other issuance costs of $78,000 and excluding the future income tax benefit of such costs. 

In February 2010, the Corporation completed an equity offering of 7,350,000 common shares of the Corporation at a price of $3.50 per share to raise gross proceeds of $25,725,000 pursuant to a short form prospectus under the
multi-jurisdictional disclosure system. Net proceeds of the offering, after the agents’ commission of 7% and other issuance costs but excluding the future income tax benefit of such costs, were $23,311,000. Under the prospectus, a total of
$21.6M of the estimated net proceeds were anticipated to be used in respect of the Bellekeno mine construction and development project, including for construction capital, for backstop finance to mitigate capital cost overrun risk and for the
mine's initial working capital finance, with the balance to be used for general working capital and corporate purposes including further general exploration activities. There has been no significant variance between the actual use of proceeds
as at the date of this MD&A and that originally anticipated under the prospectus. 

As of June 30, 2010, the Corporation's contractual commitments in respect of capital asset expenditures, primarily in respect of the Bellekeno mine development and construction project, totaled approximately $5,967,000. Also as of June 30,
2010, in respect of the December 2009 flow-through share issuance the Corporation remained committed to incur further renounceable exploration expenditures by December 31, 2010 totaling $6,815,000. 

With the closing of the December 2009 flow-through offering and the February 2010 equity offering, and combined with the remaining construction capital Alexco is receiving from Silver Wheaton, the Corporation anticipates it will have sufficient
capital resources to carry out its planned calendar 2010 exploration program and service the working capital requirements of its consulting services business and its corporate offices and administration for at least the next 12 month period, and to
complete the construction and development of, and achieve commercial production at, the Bellekeno mine.  However, as with any mine development project and as noted above under " Outlook" , the construction and development of the Bellekeno
mine involves significant inherent risks that could result in material unanticipated capital costs to the Corporation. Furthermore, as non-renewable resources, mines by their nature have a finite life. Because of these factors, combined with its
long term objectives for the exploration and development of its mineral properties, the Corporation may eventually require additional funding. 

The Corporation has historically obtained its main source of funding from equity issuances, though will consider all sources of finance reasonably available to it, including but not limited to issuance of new capital, issuance of new debt and the
sale of assets in whole or in part, including mineral property interests. There can be no assurance of continued access to finance in the future, and an inability to secure such finance may require the Corporation to substantially curtail and defer
its planned exploration and development activities.

Share Data 
As at the date of this MD&A, the Corporation has 53,538,936
common shares issued and outstanding. In addition, there are outstanding stock
options for a further 4,590,750 common shares. 
Use of Financial Instruments 
All of the Corporation’s cash and cash equivalents at June 30,
2010 were held in the form of demand deposits. The Corporation’s restricted cash
and deposits were held in the form of term deposits and demand deposits. The
Corporation’s only other financial instruments were its trade and other accounts
receivable and its accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
All term deposits held at June 30, 2010 are included in long
term restricted cash, though as individual financial instruments they carried
initial maturity periods of one year or less. They have been classified as
investments held to maturity and accordingly are carried at amortized cost using
the effective interest method. Given their short term nature and low investment
risk, the Corporation has estimated that the carrying amounts of the term
deposits approximate their fair values. The carrying amounts of the
Corporation’s trade and other accounts receivable and accounts payable and
accrued liabilities are estimated to reasonably approximate their fair values.
The Corporation holds no derivative instruments, and has not employed any
hedging activities. The fair values of all of the Corporation’s financial
instruments measured at June 30, 2010 constitute Level 2 measurements within the
fair value hierarchy defined under Canadian GAAP. 
Substantially all of the Corporation’s cash, demand deposits
and term deposits are held with major financial institutions in Canada, and
management believes the exposure to credit risk with respect to such
institutions is not significant. Those financial assets that potentially subject
the Corporation to credit risk are primarily receivables, and the Corporation’s
maximum credit risk exposure in respect of its receivables is represented by
their carrying amount. Management actively monitors the Corporation’s exposure
to credit risk under its financial instruments, particularly with respect to
receivables, and has increased its focus on credit risk given the impact of the
current economic climate on its customer base. The Corporation considers the
risk of loss to be significantly mitigated due to the financial strength of the
Corporation’s major customers, which include government organizations as well as
substantial corporate entities. As at June 30, 2010, no material provision had
been recorded in respect of impaired receivables. 
The Corporation currently has only limited exposure through its
financial instruments to fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian and
US dollar as significantly all of its property, plant and equipment and mineral
properties are located, and significantly all of its revenue is earned, in
Canada. Should the Corporation be successful in its efforts to increase the
consulting services provided in the US market, its exposure through its
financial instruments to exchange rate risk would accordingly be increased. The
Corporation’s exposure through its financial instruments to exchange rate risk
will likely increase as it commences commercial production from the Bellekeno
mine, as while the mine’s operating costs will be primarily denominated in
Canadian dollars its revenues will be primarily denominated in US dollars. 







Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Corporation has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Related Party Transactions 

During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation incurred $97,000 (2009  -   $95,000) in respect of rent expenses for office space under an agreement with Access Field Services, a company owned by certain individuals who are, or were
at the time, executive officers of the Corporation and its subsidiary Access. At June 30, 2010, accounts payable and accrued liabilities include $5,400 due to Access Field Services (2009  -   $nil). 

With respect to the Corporation's December 2009 flow-through financing, a director and an executive officer of the Corporation participated in the offering, subscribing for a total of 15,000 shares. 

These transactions were in the normal course of operations and are measured at the exchange amount, which is the amount established and agreed to by the related parties. The resulting accounts payable and accrued liabilities are payable currently
under normal third-party trade payable terms and conditions. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the valuation of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the period reported. 

Management uses its best estimates for these purposes, based on assumptions that it believes reflect the most probable set of economic conditions and planned courses of action. Nonetheless, the degree of variance between management's best
estimates and other reasonable assumptions is unusually high due to the degree of volatility present in the current economic climate.  With respect to assumptions regarding commodity prices and exchange rates used in preparing the financial
statements during fiscal 2010, management has determined its best estimates of these items for the current period based on consensus investment analyst forecasts, with year-on-year pricing for silver ranging from US$13.50 to US$18.00 per
ounce; for gold ranging from US$875 to US$1,200 per ounce; for zinc ranging from US$0.70 to US$1.00 per pound; for lead ranging from US$0.55 to US$0.85 per pound; and for the Canadian dollar ranging from US$0.92 to
US$0.99. 

The critical accounting estimates used in preparing the Corporation's financial statements are listed below. 

Mineral Properties 

The Corporation records its interests in mineral properties at cost.  Exploration and development expenditures relating to mineral properties that the Corporation has acquired, or has the right to acquire, are deferred and will be amortized against
future production following commencement of commercial production, or written off if the properties are sold, allowed to lapse, or abandoned.  Grassroots exploration expenditures, incurred prior to the Corporation acquiring or obtaining the right to
acquire a mineral property, are expensed. 

Management of the Corporation reviews and evaluates the carrying value of each mineral property for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the related asset may not be recoverable. If the total
estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and assets are written down to fair value which is normally determined using the discounted value of future cash
flows.  Where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment, management assesses whether carrying value can be recovered by considering alternative methods of determining fair value. 

As at December 31, 2008, management undertook an impairment review of the carrying amount of the Corporation's mineral properties and as a result the Brewery Creek property was written down to a nominal value of $1,000. 

Upon completion of the Development Plan as discussed above, management carried out an impairment review of the carrying amount of the Bellekeno property, and based on that review concluded that the carrying amount is not impaired. Management also
concluded that with respect to all of Alexco's mineral properties, as at June 30, 2010 









there had been no events or changes in circumstances since the last impairment review which indicated that any of their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's estimates of mineral prices, mineral resources, and operating,
capital and reclamation costs are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may affect the determination of the recoverability of mineral property carrying amounts. Although management has used its best estimate of these factors, it is
possible that material changes could occur which may adversely affect management's estimate of the net cash flows to be generated from its properties. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Corporation's asset retirement obligations (" ARO" ) relate to expected reclamation and closure activities at its mineral properties. The ARO are accreted to full value over time through periodic accretion charges. Evaluations of
the ARO at each mineral property are based on formal reviews which are conducted by management annually at a minimum and otherwise upon the occurrence of significant new events or changes in circumstances.  The Corporation prepares estimates of the
timing and amount of expected cash flows associated with its ARO, retaining independent advisors where considered appropriate. The carrying amounts of its ARO are measured by discounting the expected cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.


At June 30, 2010, the Corporation's ARO totaled $1,511,000, comprised of $1,104,000 relating to reclamation and closure activities to be performed at the end of the life of the Bellekeno mine, and $407,000 relating to
presently-ongoing reclamation and closure activities at the Brewery Creek property including site reclamation and facilities removal and post-closure monitoring. 

Approximately two thirds of the Brewery Creek ARO costs pertain to post-closure monitoring expected to span roughly the next ten years, with the balance pertaining to site reclamation and facilities removal expected to be completed within the next
two years.  The Corporation has determined the Brewery Creek ARO based on an evaluation report prepared by independent advisors. In accordance with Canadian GAAP, the Corporation has used the various classifications of probability within that report
to determine the fair value of the ARO. The report included identification of additional contingent mitigation measures that might potentially be required, assessing the likelihood of such measures being required as " possible" ,
" unlikely"  or " very unlikely" . The ARO recorded in respect of Brewery Creek at June 30, 2010 of $407,000 materially provides for all planned activities plus all contingent mitigation measures with an assessed likelihood
of " possible"  and " unlikely" .  In the highly unlikely event that all identified contingent mitigation measures should be required, including those with an assessed likelihood of " very unlikely" , this Brewery Creek
ARO would need to be increased to approximately $2.3 million. 

The Bellekeno ARO has been determined by the Corporation based on the evaluations and estimations prepared internally and used in support of the determination of the reclamation security posting requirements under the operating permits issued by the
Yukon Government for the Bellekeno mine. The ARO recorded to June 30, 2010 reflects the obligation relating to the stage of progress of the mine development and construction at that time. Given that mine production has not commenced, the Corporation
considers it very unlikely that actual reclamation and closure activities relating to that stage of progress would be materially greater than the ARO as currently recorded. Upon commencement of commercial production, the Corporation anticipates that
the recorded Bellekeno ARO will have increased to approximately $1.5 million. 

Management's determination of the Corporation's ARO is based on the reclamation and closure activities it anticipates as being required, the additional contingent mitigation measures it identifies as potentially being required and its
assessment of the likelihood of such contingent measures being required, and its estimate of the probable costs and timing of such activities and measures.  The making of such evaluations and estimates is subject to significant inherent uncertainty.
The future cash flows required to settle the Corporation's ARO may therefore vary materially from those anticipated by the ARO currently recognized in its balance sheet, and periodic re-evaluations of that ARO may result in material changes to
its balance. 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization.  Amortization for patents is calculated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  The Corporation assesses the recoverability of definite life intangible assets
if there are indications of impairment.  In performing this analysis, management considers such factors as current results, trends and future prospects, in addition to other economic and regulatory factors. When the carrying value of an intangible
asset is greater than its net recoverable value as determined on an undiscounted basis, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that its fair value, measured as the discounted cash flows over 









the life of the asset, is below the asset's carrying value. Where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment, management assesses whether carrying value can be recovered. 

As at December 31, 2008, management undertook an impairment review of the carrying amount of the Corporation's intangible assets and as a result the Corporation recognized write-downs of its intangible assets totaling $852,000, of which
$253,000 was in respect of its reclamation project assets and $599,000 was in respect of its patent assets. 

As at June 30, 2010, management concluded that there had been no events or changes in circumstances since the last impairment review which indicated that the carrying amount of any of its intangible assets was impaired. Management's estimates
of the various factors affecting its assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of its intangible assets are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may affect the determination of that recoverability. Although management
has used its best estimate of these factors, it is possible that material changes could occur which may adversely affect management's estimate of the net cash flows to be generated from its intangible assets. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue from all consulting services is recognized under the proportional performance method based on an output appropriate to the particular service contract, such as performance of agreed service deliverables, or provision of billable hours under
straight hourly bill contracts.  Where the Corporation commits to provide service deliverables under a fixed price contract, estimated costs remaining to complete the contract are regularly reviewed and full provision is made immediately for any
anticipated loss. Recognition of all revenue is subject to the provision that ultimate collection be reasonably assured at the time of recognition. 

Under the terms of the Subsidiary Agreement, ERDC is responsible for carrying out environmental care and maintenance activities at various sites in the Keno Hill district during the period required to develop and obtain acceptance and regulatory
approval for the Keno Hill district closure reclamation plan, for annual fees based on an annually-determined fixed fee benchmark adjusted each year for certain operating and inflationary factors and determined on a site-by-site basis. That the
portion of the annually-determined fee benchmark which is billable each year by ERDC in respect of each site will reduce by 15% each year until all site-specific care and maintenance activities have been replaced by closure reclamation activities.
The total amount of estimated care and maintenance fees over the remaining anticipated care and maintenance period is recognized as revenue over that period on a straight-line basis.  The Corporation could incur significant costs over the period it
undertakes such care and maintenance activities, particularly if acceptance and approval of the closure reclamation plan and commencement of reclamation activities should be significantly delayed. 

Each quarter, management reviews its estimates of when the care and maintenance period will end, and the fees ERDC will bill and the care and maintenance costs it will incur over the remainder of that period. Over the course of summer 2009 ERDC
significantly advanced its development of the closure reclamation plan, one of the results of which was that the period of time required to receive acceptance and regulatory approval of the plan was anticipated to be longer than previously
estimated. Accordingly, in performing its quarterly review of this contract as at June 30, 2009, management revised its estimates to reflect this longer period of time. As a result, a loss provision liability in respect of this contract was
recognized in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheet as at June 30, 2009 totaling $1,150,000 and which was charged to consulting costs, of which $120,000 was recognized in F2009-Q2 based on management's second quarter
review and the remaining $1,030,000 was recognized in F2009-Q4. 

During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation reduced the balance of the loss provision liability by a total of $237,000 as a result of a favourable re-assessment of the costs estimated to be incurred in meeting its future care and
maintenance obligations under the Subsidiary Agreement. The resulting gain of $237,000 has been reflected as a reduction of consulting costs, as has the reduction arising due to loss realization during the period. 

Stock Options and Warrants 

The Corporation accounts for stock options at fair value. Compensation expense for options granted is determined based on estimated fair values of the options at the time of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The cost is recognized
over the vesting period of the respective options and is capitalized to mineral properties and deferred exploration costs for grants to individuals working directly on mineral projects.  Warrants granted are recorded at estimated fair values using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the inputs required for option pricing models requires highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility and the expected 









life of the option or warrant. Changes in these subjective inputs can materially affect the result, and therefore any such model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of fair value. 

Future Income Taxes 

The Corporation uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, current income taxes are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable for the current year. Future income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and liabilities as well as for the benefit of losses available to be carried forward to future years for tax purposes. Future income tax assets are evaluated and if realization is
not considered more likely than not, a valuation allowance is estimated and recorded. 

Changes In and Initial Adoption of Accounting Policies 

As required under Canadian GAAP, the Corporation has adopted new Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (" CICA" ) Accounting Handbook Section 3064, " Goodwill and Intangible Assets" , replaced existing Handbook
Section 3062 " Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" . 

This Standard reinforces the principle-based approach to the recognition of assets only in accordance with the definition of an asset and the criteria for asset recognition, and clarifies the application of the concept of matching revenues and
expenses such that the current practice of recognizing assets that may not meet the definition and recognition criteria are eliminated. This new standard also provides guidance for the treatment of pre-production and start-up costs and requires that
these costs and related revenues be reflected in earnings.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. 

For interim and annual financial statements relating to its fiscal year commencing July 1, 2011, the Corporation will be required to adopt new CICA Accounting Handbook Section 1582 " Business Combinations" , Section 1601
" Consolidated Financial Statements"  and Section 1602 " Non-Controlling Interests" . Handbook Section 1582 replaces existing Handbook Section 1581 " Business Combinations" , and Handbook Sections
1601 and 1602 together replace Handbook Section 1600 " Consolidated Financial Statements" . 

Handbook Sections 1582, 1601 and 1602 collectively require net assets, non-controlling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at fair value and non-controlling interests to be reported as a component of equity. In
addition, the definition of a business is expanded and is described as an integrated set of activities and assets that are capable of being managed to provide a return to investors or economic benefits to owners. Acquisition costs are not part of
the consideration and are to be expensed when incurred. The Corporation has not yet determined the effect if any that the adoption of these new standards will have on its financial statements. 

As discussed above (see " Outlook" ), the Bellekeno mine development and construction project is nearing completion and the Corporation anticipates that commercial production will commence during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. As this
will be the first time the Corporation's business activities have included the operation of a producing mine, upon the commencement of commercial production it will be required to apply certain new accounting policies relevant to such new
activities and make certain new accounting estimates, some of which will be critical. 

Management anticipates the most significant new accounting policy will be with respect to revenue recognition applicable to mine production.  Canadian GAAP does not allow a choice amongst different revenue recognition policies, though the
determination of the specific policy to be applied under Canadian GAAP is dependent upon the specific terms by which mine production is sold.  Management will determine the specific revenue policies to be applied at the time commercial production
commences, based on the terms of sale then in effect.  Management anticipates the most significant new accounting estimates will be with respect to determining the date of commencement of commercial production; determining the appropriate
amortization basis for mine-related property, plant and equipment; the appropriate depletion basis for the Bellekeno mineral property carrying amount; and the determination of the asset retirement obligation pertaining to the Bellekeno mine. 

Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 

Under a pronouncement issued by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board in February 2008, effective for its fiscal year commencing July 1, 2011 the Corporation will be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards
(" IFRS" ) in replacement of Canadian GAAP, including restatement of amounts reported for comparative purposes. 









Management's IFRS changeover plan comprises three phases.  The first is scoping and planning; the second is detailed assessment and evaluation; and the third is implementation. Management has completed the first phase, identifying and
prioritizing areas of difference between Canadian GAAP and IFRS that are expected to be significant for Alexco; completing a preliminary evaluation of the expected impact on other key elements including information technology and data systems,
internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, investor relations, financial reporting personnel and training needs; and developing a project timeline for the transition. The second phase of the plan is currently in
progress, with management now conducting detailed assessments and evaluations of the identified areas of relevant accounting policy difference, including quantification of the impact of such differences. Management is also developing detailed plans
to manage and mitigate the impact of changeover on the other key elements. The key personnel involved in the development and execution of the changeover plan have undergone training, and training plans are also being developed for key personnel who
will be involved in the implementation phase of the plan including members of the Corporation's audit committee and board of directors. With respect to the remaining key elements, management has determined that the impact of changeover is not
likely to be significant, requiring only minor modifications to those systems, controls and procedures. The Corporation is currently substantially on track with its changeover project timeline. 

With respect to accounting policies, significant areas of difference between Canadian GAAP and IFRS have been identified to date which are likely or potentially significant to Alexco.  While the quantitative impact of these differences on the
Corporation's future financial position and results of operations has not yet been determined, the differences in general are summarized as follows. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Under Canadian GAAP, the cost of items of property, plant and equipment made up of significant separable component parts is allocated to the component parts when practicable. Under IFRS (IAS 16), the cost of such items must be allocated to their
significant component parts, without consideration of practicability, with each component part then depreciated separately. Such componentization may result in changes to recorded depreciation charges. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

Under Canadian GAAP, asset retirement obligations are measured based on the fair value of future estimated retirement expenditures, with the initial liability and any subsequent downward revisions of the future estimated expenditures discounted
using the historical credit-adjusted risk-free rate effective at the time of original recognition. Subsequent upwards revisions of the future estimated expenditures are discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate effective at the time of
revision, creating a layering concept. Under IFRS (IAS 37), at each reporting date such expenditures are discounted using a rate that reflects then-current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability,
eliminating the layering concept. This difference may result in changes to the Corporation's recorded asset retirement obligations at any given reporting date. 

Impairment of Assets 

Under IFRS (IAS 36), both the testing for impairment of assets and the determination of impairment losses differ from Canadian GAAP. IFRS removes the undiscounted cash flow test under Canadian GAAP for impairment testing, and instead uses a one-step
process comparing the carrying amount to the greater of value in use based on discounted cash flows, and fair value less costs to sell. An impairment loss is recorded for any shortfall. In addition, under IFRS, subsequent reversals of impairment
losses are recognized in the periods the reversals occur.  Under Canadian GAAP, subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. These differences may result in changes to the carrying amounts of the Corporation's assets as well as
its recorded impairment losses, including the potential recording of impairment reversals. 

Income Taxes 

Under IFRS (IAS 12), deferred income taxes, referred to as future income taxes under Canadian GAAP, are recognized for temporary differences arising from the difference between the historical exchange rate and the current exchange rate translations
of the cost of non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the Corporation's functional currency. Under Canadian GAAP, these temporary differences are not accounted for. Also, under IFRS, deferred income taxes are
not recognized for temporary differences that arise from differences between the fair values and tax bases of assets acquired in transactions other than a business combination. Under Canadian GAAP, future income taxes are recognized for such
temporary differences and affect the carrying value of the related asset. These differences may result in changes to the Corporation's reported future income tax assets and liabilities, 




as well as certain assets with carrying values affected by such
differences including deferred exploration and development costs. 
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments

The recognition and measurement of financial instruments under
IFRS (IAS 39) differs from Canadian GAAP in certain respects, including no
allowance for a choice in the policy for accounting for transaction costs,
certain differences in when changes in carrying value are recognized through net
income versus other comprehensive income, and certain differences in the
circumstances under which embedded derivatives are recognized. These differences
could result in changes to the Corporation’s reported financial assets and
liabilities. 
IFRS 6, “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral
Resources” 
With respect to the accounting for mineral resource exploration
and evaluation expenditures, the policies outlined under IFRS 6 are
substantially similar to those established under Canadian GAAP, including
allowing the Corporation the choice to either expense or capitalize such
expenditures so long as the chosen policy is consistently applied. Though
management’s evaluation of IFRS 6 remains ongoing as part of the second phase of
its changeover plan, at this time it is anticipated that the accounting policies
the Corporation will adopt under IFRS with respect to mineral resource
exploration and evaluation expenditures will be substantially similar to those
it currently applies under Canadian GAAP. 
First Time Adoption of IFRS 
Under IFRS 1, “First-time Adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards”, entities adopting IFRS for the first time
are provided with a number of optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions, in
certain areas, to the general requirement for full retrospective application of
IFRS. As part of the second phase of its changeover plan, management is
currently analyzing the various optional exemptions available for the purpose of
determining which if any it will elect to apply upon the Corporation’s adoption
of IFRS. 
Controls and Procedures 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The Corporation’s management, with the participation of its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based
upon the results of that evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered by this MD&A, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to
be disclosed by the Corporation in reports it files under applicable securities
legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
appropriate time periods and forms specified in those rules. 
Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
The management of Alexco is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and effected by the
Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. It includes those policies and procedures that:



  
     
    (i) 
    
      pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and
      fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, the transactions related to and
      dispositions of Alexco’s assets;
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (ii) 
    
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
      recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Alexco
      receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations
      of management and Alexco’s directors; and




  
     
    (iii) 
    
      provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
      timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Alexco
      assets that could have a material effect on Alexco’s financial
      statements.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of Alexco’s internal
control over financial reporting as at June 30, 2010, based on the criteria set
forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
assessment, management has concluded that Alexco’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as at June 30, 2010. 
The effectiveness of Alexco’s internal control over financial
reporting as at June 30, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
Alexco’s independent auditors. 
There has been no change in the Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting during the Corporation’s year ended June 30, 2010 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. 
Risk Factors 
The following are major risk factors management has identified
which relate to the Corporation’s business activities. Such risk factors could
materially affect the Corporation's future financial results, and could cause
events to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements
relating to the Corporation. Though the following are major risk factors
identified by management, they do not comprise a definitive list of all risk
factors related to the Corporation's business and operations. Other specific
risk factors are discussed elsewhere in this MD&A. 
Exploration and Development 
Mineral exploration and development involves a high degree of
risk and few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into
producing mines. With respect to the Corporation’s properties, should any ore
reserves exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm ore
reserves which are sufficient to commercially mine, and to obtain the required
environmental approvals and permitting required to commence commercial
operations. Should any mineral resource be defined on such properties there can
be no assurance that the mineral resource on such properties can be commercially
mined or that the metallurgical processing will produce economically viable and
saleable products. The decision as to whether a property contains a commercial
mineral deposit and should be brought into production will depend upon the
results of exploration programs and/or technical studies, and the
recommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or geologists, all of which
involves significant expense. This decision will involve consideration and
evaluation of several significant factors including, but not limited to: (1)
costs of bringing a property into production, including exploration and
development work, preparation of appropriate technical studies and construction
of production facilities; (2) availability and costs of financing; (3) ongoing
costs of production; (4) market prices for the minerals to be produced; (5)
environmental compliance regulations and restraints (including potential
environmental liabilities associated with historical exploration activities);
and (6) political climate and/or governmental regulation and control. 
The ability of the Corporation to sell, and profit from the
sale of any eventual production from any of the Corporation’s properties will be
subject to the prevailing conditions in the marketplace at the time of sale.
Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Corporation and therefore
represent a market risk which could impact the long term viability of the
Corporation and its operations. 
Figures for the Corporation's Resources are Estimates Based
on Interpretation and Assumptions and May Yield Less Mineral Production Under
Actual Conditions than is Currently Estimated 
In making determinations about whether to advance any of its
projects to development, the Corporation must rely upon estimated calculations
as to the mineral resources and grades of mineralization on its properties.
Until ore is actually mined and processed, mineral resources and grades of
mineralization must be considered as estimates only. Mineral resource estimates
are imprecise and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical
inferences drawn from drilling and sampling which may prove to be unreliable.
Alexco cannot be certain that: 








reserve, resource or other mineralization estimates will be accurate; or

mineralization can be mined or processed profitably.


Any material changes in mineral resource estimates and grades of mineralization will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and a property's return on capital.  The Corporation's resource estimates have been
determined and valued based on assumed future prices, cut-off grades and operating costs that may prove to be inaccurate.  Extended declines in market prices for silver and other metals may render portions of the Corporation's mineralization
uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineral resources. 

Keno Hill District 

While the Corporation has conducted exploration activities in the Keno Hill district, other than with respect to the Bellekeno property, further review of historical records and additional exploration and geological testing will be required to
determine whether any of the mineral deposits it contains are economically recoverable.  There is no assurance that such exploration and testing will result in favourable results. The history of the Keno Hill district has been one of fluctuating
fortunes, with new technologies and concepts reviving the district numerous times from probable closure until 1989, when it did ultimately close down for a variety of economic and technical reasons. Many or all of these economic and technical issues
will need to be addressed prior to the commencement of any future production on the Keno Hill properties. 

Under the terms of the Subsidiary Agreement, ERDC is responsible for carrying out environmental care and maintenance activities at various sites in the Keno Hill district during the period required to develop and obtain acceptance and regulatory
approval for the Keno Hill district closure reclamation plan, for annual fees based on an annually-determined fixed fee benchmark adjusted each year for certain operating and inflationary factors and determined on a site-by-site basis. The portion
of the annually-determined fee benchmark which is billable each year by ERDC in respect of each site will reduce by 15% each year until all site-specific care and maintenance activities have been replaced by closure reclamation activities. The
Corporation could incur significant costs over the period it undertakes such care and maintenance activities, particularly if acceptance and approval of the closure reclamation plan and commencement of reclamation activities should be significantly
delayed. 

Construction and Operation of the Bellekeno Mine 

The decision by the Corporation to proceed with the construction and development of the Bellekeno mine was based on the Development Plan, which included estimates for metal production and capital and operating costs. Until mined and processed, no
assurance can be given that such estimates will be achieved. Failure to achieve these production and capital and operating cost estimates or material increases in costs could have an adverse impact on the Corporation's future cash flows,
profitability, results of operations and financial condition. The Corporation's actual production and capital and operating costs may vary from estimates for a variety of reasons, including:  actual resources mined varying from estimates of
grade, tonnage, dilution and metallurgical and other characteristics; short-term operating factors relating to the mineable resources, such as the need for sequential development of resource bodies and the processing of new or different resource
grades; revisions to mine plans; risks and hazards associated with mining; natural phenomena, such as inclement weather conditions, water availability, floods and earthquakes; and unexpected labour shortages or strikes.  Costs of production may also
be affected by a variety of factors, including changing waste ratios, metallurgical grades, labour costs, commodity costs, general inflationary pressures and currency rates. 

Permitting and Environmental Risks and Other Regulatory Requirements 

The current or future operations of the Corporation, including development activities, commencement of production on its properties and activities associated with the Corporation's mine reclamation and remediation business, require permits or
licenses from various federal, territorial and other governmental authorities, and such operations are and will be governed by laws, regulations and agreements governing prospecting, development, mining, production, taxes, labour standards,
occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. Companies engaged in the development and operation of mines and related facilities and in mine reclamation and remediation
activities generally experience increased costs and delays as a result of the need to comply with the applicable laws, regulations and permits. There can be no assurance that all permits which the Corporation may require for the conduct of its
operations will be obtainable on reasonable terms or that such laws and regulations would not have an adverse effect on any project which the Corporation might undertake, including but not limited to the Bellekeno mine project. 









Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective
measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations or in mine reclamation and remediation activities may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by
reason of such activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed upon them for violation of applicable laws or regulations. 

Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies and mine reclamation and remediation activities could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation. As well, policy changes and
political pressures within and on federal, territorial and First Nation governments having jurisdiction over or dealings with the Corporation could change the implementation and interpretation of such laws, regulations and permits, also having a
material adverse impact on the Corporation.  Such impacts could result in one or more of increases in capital expenditures or production costs, reductions in levels of production at producing properties or abandonment or delays in the development of
new mining properties. 

Environmental Consulting Services 

A material decline in the level of activity or reduction in industry willingness to spend capital on mine reclamation, remediation or environmental services could adversely affect demand for the Corporation's consulting services. Likewise, a
material change in mining product commodity prices, the ability of mining companies to raise capital or changes in domestic or international political, regulatory and economic conditions could adversely affect demand for the Corporation's services.


Two of the Corporation's customers accounted for a combined 53% of revenues in the 2010 fiscal year. The loss of, or a significant reduction in the volume of business conducted with, this customer could have a significant detrimental effect on
the Corporation's environmental consulting services business. 

The patents which the Corporation owns or has access to or other proprietary technology may not prevent the Corporation's competitors from developing substantially similar technology, which may reduce the Corporation's competitive advantage.
Similarly, the loss of access to any of such patents or other proprietary technology or claims from third parties that such patents or other proprietary technology infringe upon proprietary rights which they may claim or hold would be detrimental to
the Corporation's reclamation and remediation business. 

The Corporation may not be able to keep pace with continual and rapid technological developments that characterize the market for the Corporation's mine reclamation and remediation services and the Corporation's failure to do so may result in a loss
of its market share. Similarly, changes in existing regulations relating to mine reclamation and remediation activities could require the Corporation to change the way it conducts its business. 

Potential Profitability Of Mineral Properties Depends Upon Metal Prices and Other Factors Beyond the Control of the Corporation 

The potential profitability of mineral properties is dependent upon many factors beyond the Corporation's control. For instance, world prices of and markets for gold, silver, lead and zinc are unpredictable, highly volatile, potentially
subject to governmental fixing, pegging and/or controls and respond to changes in domestic, international, political, social and economic environments.  Another factor is that rates of recovery of mined ore may vary from the rate experienced in
tests and a reduction in the recovery rate will adversely affect profitability and, possibly, the economic viability of a property.  Profitability also depends on the costs of operations, including costs of labour, equipment, electricity,
environmental compliance or other production inputs. Such costs will fluctuate in ways the Corporation cannot predict and are beyond the Corporation's control, and such fluctuations will impact on profitability and may eliminate profitability
altogether.  Additionally, due to worldwide economic uncertainty, the availability and cost of funds for development and other costs have become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to project.  These changes and events may materially affect
the financial performance of the Corporation. 

First Nation Rights and Title 

The nature and extent of First Nation rights and title remains the subject of active debate, claims and litigation in Canada, including in the Yukon and including with respect to intergovernmental relations between First Nation authorities and
federal, provincial and territorial authorities.  There can be no guarantee that such claims will not cause permitting delays, unexpected interruptions or additional costs for the Corporation's projects. 




Title to Mineral Properties 
The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a complicated
and uncertain process. The properties may be subject to prior unregistered
agreements of transfer or land claims, and title may be affected by undetected
defects. The Corporation has taken steps, in accordance with industry standards,
to verify mineral properties in which it has an interest. Although the
Corporation has made efforts to ensure that legal title to its properties is
properly recorded in the name of the Corporation, there can be no assurance that
such title will ultimately be secured. 
Capitalization and Commercial Viability 
The Corporation will require additional funds to further
explore, develop and mine its properties. The Corporation has limited financial
resources, and there is no assurance that additional funding will be available
to the Corporation to carry out the completion of all proposed activities, for
additional exploration or for the substantial capital that is typically required
in order to place a property into commercial production. In addition, while the
Corporation intends to draw upon the remaining US$35 million Silver Wheaton
deposit amount to fund the construction and development of the Bellekeno mine,
there remains a risk that Silver Wheaton will be unable or unwilling to pay such
funds. Although the Corporation has been successful in the past in obtaining
financing through the sale of equity securities, there can be no assurance that
the Corporation will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that
the terms of such financing will be favourable. Failure to obtain such
additional financing could result in the delay or indefinite postponement of
further exploration and development of its properties. 
General Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect the
Corporation’s Growth and Profitability. 
The unprecedented events in global financial markets since 2008
have had a profound impact on the global economy and led to increased levels of
volatility. Many industries, including the mining industry, are impacted by
these market conditions. Some of the impacts of the current financial market
turmoil include contraction in credit markets resulting in a widening of credit
risk, devaluations and high volatility in global equity, commodity, foreign
exchange and precious metal markets, and a lack of market liquidity. If the
current turmoil and volatility levels continue they may adversely affect the
Corporation's growth and profitability. Specifically: 

  
  a global credit/liquidity crisis could impact the cost and availability of
  financing and the Corporation’s overall liquidity; 
  
  the volatility of silver prices would impact the Corporation’s revenues,
  profits, losses and cash flow; 
  
  volatile energy prices, commodity and consumables prices and currency
  exchange rates would impact the Corporation’s operating costs; and 
  
  the devaluation and volatility of global stock markets could impact the
  valuation of the Corporation’s equity and other securities. 
These factors could have a material adverse effect on Alexco’s
financial condition and results of operations. 
Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements 
This MD&A contains “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian
securities laws concerning the Corporation's anticipated results and
developments in the Corporation’s operations in future periods, planned
exploration and development of its properties, plans related to its business and

of other future business operations, requirements for additional capital and
sources and uses of funds. Any statements that express or involve discussions
with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections,
objectives, assumptions or future 







events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as " expects" , " anticipates" , " plans" , " estimates" , " intends" , " strategy" , " goals" ,
" objectives"  or stating that certain actions, events or results " may" , " could" , " would" , " might"  or " will"  be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms
and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward-looking statements" . 

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such factors
include, among others, risks related to actual results of exploration activities; actual results of remediation and reclamation activities; conclusions of economic evaluations; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; future
prices of gold, silver and other commodities; possible variations in ore reserves, grade or recovery rates; failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry; and
delays in obtaining governmental approvals or financing or in the completion of development activities. Furthermore, forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently uncertain, and actual achievements of the Corporation
or other future events or conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those referred to in this MD&A under the
heading " Risk Factors"  and elsewhere. 

Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors  -   Information Concerning Preparation of Resource Estimates 

This MD&A has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. Unless otherwise indicated, all resource and reserve estimates
included in this MD&A have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Classification System.  NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards
for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. NI 43-101 permits the disclosure of an historical estimate made prior to the adoption of NI 43-101 that does not otherwise comply with NI
43-101, using the historical terminology, if the disclosure: (a) identifies the source and date of the historical estimate; (b) comments on the relevance and reliability of the historical estimate; (c) states whether the historical estimate uses
categories other than those prescribed by NI 43-101 and if so includes an explanation of the differences; and (d) includes any more recent estimates or data available.  Such historical estimates are presented concerning certain of the
Corporation's properties described herein. 

Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (" SEC" ) under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and resource and reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term " resource"  does not
equate to the term " reserves" . Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a " reserve"  unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted
at the time the reserve determination is made. The SEC's disclosure standards under Industry Guide 7 do not define the terms and normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning " measured mineral resources" ,
" indicated mineral resources"  or " inferred mineral resources"  or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute " reserves"  by U.S. standards in documents filed with
the SEC. U.S. Investors should also understand that " inferred mineral resources"  have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or
any part of an " inferred mineral resource"  will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimated " inferred mineral resources"  may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in
rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an " inferred mineral resource"  exists or is economically or legally mineable. 

Disclosure of " contained ounces"  in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute " reserves"  by SEC standards
as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.  The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of " reserves"  are also not the same as those of the SEC's Industry Guide 7, and reserves reported by the
Corporation in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as " reserves"  under Industry Guide 7 standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by
companies that report in accordance with U. S. standards.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING 
The management of Alexco Resource Corp. is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and
effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. It includes those policies and
procedures that: 


  
    (i) 
    
      pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and
      fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, the transactions related to and
      dispositions of Alexco’s assets;
  
     
     
  
    (ii) 
    
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
      recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Alexco
      receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations
      of management and Alexco’s directors; and
  
     
     
  
    (iii) 
    
      provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
      timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Alexco
      assets that could have a material effect on Alexco’s financial
      statements.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of Alexco’s internal
control over financial reporting as at June 30, 2010, based on the criteria set
forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
assessment, management has concluded that Alexco’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as at June 30, 2010.

To the Shareholders of Alexco Resource Corp.:
We have completed an integrated audit of Alexco Resource
Corp.’s 2010 and 2009 consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as at June 30, 2010. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Alexco Resource Corp. as at June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, the consolidated
statement of cash flows and the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity
for each of the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of the Company’s financial statements
in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. A financial statement audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as at June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years then ended in accordance with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting
We have also audited Alexco Resource Corp.’s internal control
over financial reporting as at June 30, 2010, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
“PricewaterhouseCoopers” refers to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an Ontario limited liability partnership, or, as the
context requires, the PricewaterhouseCoopers global network or other member
firms of the network, each of which is a separate legal entity.


 
A Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at June 30,
2010 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO.
Yours very truly,
 
Chartered Accountants

    ALEXCO RESOURCE CORP. 
  
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  
    FOR THE YEARS
      ENDED JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009 
  
    (figures in tables are expressed in thousands of
      dollars) 


  
    1. 
    
      Nature of Operations
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
      Alexco Resource Corp. (“Alexco” or the “Corporation”) was
      incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Yukon) on
      December 3, 2004 and commenced operations on March 15, 2005. Effective
      December 28, 2007, it was continued under the Business Corporations Act
      (British Columbia). Alexco conducts mineral exploration and
      development in Canada, primarily in Yukon Territory. Alexco also provides
      consulting and project management services in respect of environmental
      permitting and compliance and site remediation and reclamation, both in
      Canada and internationally.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
      The Corporation is in the process of exploring and
      developing its mineral properties. The recoverability of the carrying
      amount for each of its mineral properties is dependent upon the existence
      of economically recoverable reserves, successful permitting, the ability
      of the Corporation to obtain necessary financing to complete the
      exploration and development, and upon future profitable production or
      proceeds from disposition of each mineral property. Furthermore, the
      acquisition of title to mineral properties is a complicated and uncertain
      process, and while the Corporation has taken steps in accordance with
      normal industry standards to verify its title to the mineral properties in
      which it has an interest, there can be no assurance that such title will
      ultimately be secured. The carrying amounts of mineral properties are
      based on costs incurred to date, and do not necessarily represent present
      or future values.
  
     
     
     
  
    2. 
    
      Significant Accounting Policies
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (a) 
    
      Basis of Consolidation and Financial Statement
      Presentation
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
    
      The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements have
      been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in Canada
      (“Canadian GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Corporation and its
      wholly owned subsidiaries, Alexco Keno Hill Mining Corp. (formerly Alexco
      Resource Canada Corp., formerly 650399 B.C. Ltd.), Elsa Reclamation &
      Development Company Ltd. (“ERDC”), Alexco Exploration Canada Corp., Access
      Mining Consultants Ltd. (“Access”) and Alexco Resource U.S. Corp. All
      significant inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on
      consolidation. Significant differences from accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States including practices prescribed by
      the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“US GAAP”) are described in
      note 22.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
    
      All amounts are reported and measured in Canadian
      dollars. Certain of the comparative figures have been reclassified to
      conform with the current period's presentation format.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (b) 
    
      Use of Estimates
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
    
      The preparation of financial statements in conformity
      with Canadian GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that affect the reported amounts and the valuation of assets and
      liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
      date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
      expenditures during the period reported. Significant areas requiring the
      use of management’s judgment include evaluating the carrying value and
      recoverability of property, plant and equipment, mineral properties,
      intangible assets and goodwill; determining amortization rates; estimating
      asset retirement obligations including future environmental obligations
      and site reclamation costs; evaluating fixed price contracts to determine
      possible loss provisions; estimating future income taxes; determining the
      value of stock-based compensation and securities issued for non-cash
      consideration; and allocating proceeds received from issuance of units to
      the component securities. The use of such judgment includes, but is not
      limited to, the estimations of mineral resources, future mineral prices
      and project capital, operating and reclamation costs. Actual results could
      differ materially, and such estimates may be subject to change in the
      future.

    (c) 
    
      Cash and Cash Equivalents
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Cash and cash equivalents are unrestricted as to use and
      consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short term interest-bearing
      investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the original date of
      acquisition and which can readily be liquidated to known amounts of
      cash.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (d) 
    
      Property, Plant and Equipment
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost,
      including any directly attributable financing or interest costs, and
      amortization begins when the asset is substantially put into service.
      Amortization of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the
      following methods:



  
    Heavy machinery and equipment 
    5 years straight-line 
  
    Furniture and office equipment 
    5 years straight-line 
  
    Computer hardware 
    3 years straight-line 
  
    Computer software 
    2 years straight-line 
  
    Leasehold improvements 
    Straight-line over the term of
      lease 
  
    Roads 
    5 years straight-line 
  
    Camp and other site infrastructure 
    10 years straight-line
  


  
     
    
    
      Management reviews and evaluates the carrying amount of
      property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in
      circumstances indicate that such amount may not be recoverable. If the
      total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than
      the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and the
      asset written down to fair value which is normally determined based on the
      discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (e) 
    
      Mineral Properties
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Mineral property interests are recorded at cost,
      including any directly attributable financing or interest costs, and
      expenditures on exploration or mine development activities undertaken on
      mineral properties the Corporation has acquired, or has the right to
      acquire, are deferred, net of any directly attributable expenditure
      recoveries recognized such as exploration or investment tax credits.
      Mineral property acquisition costs include costs of both initially
      acquiring and subsequently maintaining title to mineral property
      interests. Deferred exploration costs include exploration and other
      activities and expenditures directed at identifying the resource potential
      of the mineral property interests and otherwise developing and assessing
      the feasibility of bringing them into production. Once it has been
      determined that a mineral deposit can and will be economically developed
      based on a positive definitive economic analysis, deferred development
      costs include costs incurred prior to and during production to establish
      access to the deposit. Grassroots exploration expenditures, incurred prior
      to the Corporation acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire a mineral
      property, are expensed. The carrying amount of each mineral property,
      including deferred exploration and development costs, will be amortized
      against future production on a units of production basis following
      commencement of commercial production, or written off if the property is
      allowed to lapse or is abandoned.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Management reviews and evaluates the carrying amount of
      each mineral property, including deferred exploration and development
      costs, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
      that such amount may not be recoverable. If the total estimated future
      cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of
      the mineral property, an impairment loss is recognized and the property
      written down to fair value which is normally determined based on the
      discounted value of estimated future cash
flows.

    (f) 
    
      Intangible Assets
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Intangible assets consist of customer relationships,
      rights to provide services and database assets acquired through business
      combinations, as well as acquired patents having definite lives, and are
      recorded at cost. All of the Corporation’s intangible assets have definite
      lives, and are amortized over their expected useful lives using the
      following methods:



  
    Customer relationships 
    5 years straight-line 
  
    Rights to provide services and database 
    4 years straight-line 
  
    Patents 
    Straight-line over remaining
      life 


  
     
    
    
      Management reviews and evaluates the carrying amount of
      definite life intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
      circumstances indicate that such amount may not be recoverable. If the
      total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than
      the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and the
      asset written down to fair value which is normally determined based on the

      Deposits Under Silver Purchase Agreement
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Payments received in advance under silver purchase
      agreement which are refundable under certain limited circumstances (see
      note 8) are recorded as deposits. The balance of such deposits will be
      reduced on each silver delivery by the excess of the prevailing market
      value of the silver delivered over the per-ounce cash amount paid by the
      purchaser at the time, with the amount of such reduction recognized as
      revenue from the sale of mined silver.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (h) 
    
      Asset Retirement Obligations
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Future obligations to retire an asset, including
      dismantling, remediation and ongoing treatment and monitoring of the site,
      are recognized and recorded as a liability at fair value at the time the
      asset is acquired or the event occurs giving rise to such an obligation,
      with fair value measured by discounting the estimated cash flows required
      to fulfill such obligations using an appropriate interest rate. The
      liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings. The
      corresponding asset retirement cost is capitalized into the asset’s
      carrying value and is amortized over the asset’s useful life in accordance
      with the Corporation’s capital asset amortization policies. Estimates of
      the timing and amount of undiscounted cash flows required to fulfill asset
      retirement obligations are updated periodically to reflect significant
      changes in facts and circumstances, and the obligations are remeasured to
      incorporate any resulting change in their fair value. The capitalized
      asset retirement cost is correspondingly increased or decreased by the
      amount of remeasurement, and if reduced to nil then any further reduction
      is taken into income as a gain.

      Revenue Recognition
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Revenue from all consulting services is recognized under
      the proportional performance method based on an output appropriate to the
      particular service contract, such as performance of agreed service
      deliverables, or provision of billable hours under straight hourly bill
      contracts. Payments received prior to recognition of the related revenue
      are recorded as unearned revenue. Where the Corporation commits to provide
      service deliverables under a fixed price contract, estimated costs
      remaining to complete the contract are regularly reviewed and full
      provision is made immediately for any anticipated loss. Recognition of all
      revenue is subject to the provision that ultimate collection be reasonably
      assured at the time of recognition.

      Stock-Based Compensation
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Corporation accounts for stock-based compensation at
      fair value. Compensation expense for options granted is determined based
      on the estimated fair value of the options at the time of grant using the
      Black-Scholes option pricing model. The cost is recognized over the
      vesting period of the respective options using the graded vesting
      attribution method and is capitalized to mineral properties for grants to
      individuals working directly on mineral projects. The effects of
    actual

      forfeitures of unvested options are recognized as they
      occur. Consideration paid on exercise of options is credited to share
      capital.

      Income taxes
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Corporation follows the asset and liability method of
      tax allocation accounting. Under this method, current income taxes are
      recognized for the estimated income taxes payable for the current year.
      Future tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
      consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial
      statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
      respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using
      enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
      income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
      be recovered or settled. The effect on future tax assets and liabilities
      of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
      includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment. The amount of
      future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount that is
      estimated as more likely than not to be realized.

      Translation of Foreign Currencies
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Corporation’s functional currency is the Canadian
      dollar. Foreign operations are integrated with the parent company and,
      consequently, the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are
      translated into the Corporation’s primary functional currency using the
      temporal method. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into
      Canadian dollars at either actual or estimated exchange rates in effect on
      the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign
      currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the exchange rates in
      effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses
      are recognized in income.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (m) 
    
      Earnings or Loss Per Share
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Earnings or loss per common share is calculated based on
      the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
      The Corporation follows the treasury stock method in the calculation of
      diluted earnings per share. Under the treasury stock method, the weighted
      average number of common shares outstanding used for the calculation of
      diluted earnings per share assumes that the proceeds to be received on the
      exercise of dilutive stock options and warrants are used to repurchase
      common shares at the weighted average market price during the
    period.

      Financial Instruments
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Financial assets, financial liabilities and non-financial
      derivative contracts are initially recognized at fair value on the balance
      sheet when the Corporation becomes a party to their contractual
      provisions. Measurement in subsequent periods depends on the financial
      instrument’s classification. The Corporation’s cash and cash equivalents
      are classified as held for trading and thus are recorded at fair value on
      the balance sheet, with changes in the fair value of these instruments
      reflected in net earnings. Investments, including term deposits not
      included in cash equivalents, with fixed or determinable payments and
      fixed maturity and which the Corporation has the intention and ability to
      hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and thus are recorded
      at amortized cost using the effective interest method. All other financial
      assets except receivables are classified as available for sale and thus
      are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in the fair
      value of these instruments reflected in other comprehensive income.
      Receivables and all financial liabilities are recorded at amortized cost.
      Transaction costs incurred to acquire financial instruments other than
      those classified as held for trading are added to the initial carrying
      amount. Regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted
      for on the trade date.

    (figures in tables are expressed in thousands of dollars)
    
  

Measurement of the fair value of
financial instruments is made under a fair value hierarchy comprising three
levels reflecting the significance of the inputs used in making the
measurements, described as follows: 


  
    
    Level 1: 
    
      Valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
      markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
  
    
    Level 2: 
    
      Valuations based on directly or indirectly observable
      inputs in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, other than
      Level 1 prices, such as quoted interest or currency exchange rates; and
      
  
    
    Level 3: 
    
      Valuations based on significant inputs that are not
      derived from observable market data, such as discounted cash flow
      methodologies based on internal cash flow forecasts.



  
    3. 
    
      Accounting Policy Changes
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (a) 
    
      Recently-Adopted Accounting Policy
  Changes
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
    
      As required under Canadian GAAP, the Corporation has
      adopted new Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”)
      Accounting Handbook Section 3064, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”,
      replaced existing Handbook Section 3062 “Goodwill and Other Intangible
      Assets”.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
    
      This Standard reinforces the principle-based approach to
      the recognition of assets only in accordance with the definition of an
      asset and the criteria for asset recognition, and clarifies the
      application of the concept of matching revenues and expenses such that the
      current practice of recognizing assets that may not meet the definition
      and recognition criteria are eliminated. This new standard also provides
      guidance for the treatment of pre-production and start-up costs and
      requires that these costs and related revenues be reflected in earnings.
      The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
      Corporation’s consolidated financial statements.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (b) 
    
      Future Accounting Policy Changes
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
    
      Under Canadian GAAP, for interim and annual financial
      statements relating to its fiscal year commencing July 1, 2011, the
      Corporation will be required to adopt new CICA Accounting Handbook Section
      1582 “Business Combinations”, Section 1601 “Consolidated Financial
      Statements” and Section 1602 “Non-Controlling Interests”. Handbook Section
      1582 replaces existing Handbook Section 1581 “Business Combinations”, and
      Handbook Sections 1601 and 1602 together replace Handbook Section 1600
      “Consolidated Financial Statements”.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
    
      Handbook Sections 1582, 1601 and 1602 collectively
      require net assets, non-controlling interests and goodwill acquired in a
      business combination to be recorded at fair value and non-controlling
      interests to be reported as a component of equity. In addition, the
      definition of a business is expanded and is described as an integrated set
      of activities and assets that are capable of being managed to provide a
      return to investors or economic benefits to owners. Acquisition costs are
      not part of the consideration and are to be expensed when incurred. The
      Corporation has not yet determined the effect if any that the adoption of
      these new standards will have on its financial
  statements.

During the year ended June 30, 2010,
the Corporation recorded total amortization of property, plant and equipment of
$942,000 (2009 – $929,000), of which $638,000 (2009 – $579,000) was related to
property, plant and equipment used in exploration and development activities and
has been capitalized to mineral properties and $49,000 (2009 – $nil) was
capitalized to the ore processing mill under construction. The balance of
$255,000 (2009 – $350,000) has been charged to income, of which $87,000 (2009 -
$ nil) is recorded in consulting costs and $168,000 ($2009 - $350,000) is
reflected under general expenses. 
During the year ended June 30, 2009,
management undertook an impairment review of the carrying amount of the
Corporation’s property, plant and equipment. Based on this review, management
determined that its carrying amount was fully recoverable and therefore no
impairment write-down was required.

    (figures in tables are expressed in thousands of dollars)
    
  




  
     
    (a) 
    
      Keno Hill District Properties
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Corporation’s mineral interest holdings in the Keno
      Hill district, located in Canada’s Yukon Territory, are comprised of a
      number of properties, the most significant of which currently is
      Bellekeno. The Bellekeno mine and ore processing mill are currently in
      development and construction, with production scheduled to commence during
      the second half of calendar 2010.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The majority of the Corporation’s mineral property
      interests within the Keno Hill district were purchased from the interim
      receiver of United Keno Hill Mines Limited and UKH Minerals Limited
      (collectively, “UKHM”) and are held by ERDC. As a condition of that
      purchase, a separate agreement was entered into between Alexco, ERDC, the
      Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon (the “Subsidiary
      Agreement”), under which the Government of Canada has indemnified ERDC and
      Alexco from and against all liabilities arising directly or indirectly
      from the pre-existing condition of the UKHM properties. The Subsidiary
      Agreement also provides that ERDC may bring any mine into production on
      the UKHM properties by designating a production unit from the mineral
      property interests relevant to that purpose and then assuming
      responsibility for all costs of the production unit’s water related care
      and maintenance and water related components of closure
  reclamation.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In addition, the Subsidiary Agreement details the basis
      under which ERDC is retained by the Government of Canada as a paid
      contractor responsible for the environmental care and maintenance and
      ultimate closure reclamation of the UKHM properties. It provides that ERDC
      is responsible for the development of the ultimate closure reclamation
      plan for fees of 65% of agreed commercial contractor rates, and this plan
      development is currently ongoing. Upon acceptance and regulatory approval,
      the closure reclamation plan will be implemented by ERDC at full
      negotiated contractor rates. During the period required to develop the
      plan, ERDC is responsible for carrying out environmental care and
      maintenance at various sites within the UKHM properties, for a fixed
      annual fee adjusted each year for certain operating and inflationary
      factors and determined on a site-by-site basis. The portion of the annual
      fee amount so determined which is billable by ERDC in respect of each site
      will reduce by 15% each year until all site-specific care and maintenance
      activities have been replaced by closure reclamation activities; provided
      however that should a closure reclamation plan be prepared but not
      accepted and approved, the portion of annual fees billable by ERDC will
      revert to 85% until the Subsidiary Agreement is either amended or
      terminated. ERDC receives agreed commercial contractor rates when retained
      by government to provide consulting services in the Keno Hill district
      outside the scope of the Subsidiary Agreement.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Also under the Subsidiary Agreement, ERDC is required to
      pay into a separate reclamation trust a 1.5% net smelter return royalty,
      to an aggregate maximum of $4 million for all production units, from any
      future production from the UKHM properties, commencing once earnings from
      mining before interest, taxes and depreciation exceed actual exploration
      costs, to a maximum of $6.2 million, plus actual development and
      construction capital. A portion of any future proceeds from sales of the
      acquired UKHM assets must also be paid into the separate reclamation
      trust.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Subsidiary Agreement can be terminated at ERDC’s
      election should a closure reclamation plan be prepared but not accepted
      and approved, and at the Governments’ election should ERDC be declared in
      default under the Subsidiary Agreement. Until the earlier of the date a
      mine is brought into commercial production on the UKHM properties and the
      date the active component of closure reclamation is completed, if ERDC
      should be declared in default, the Corporation will be required to deposit
      the sum of $6 million into the separate reclamation trust as a default
      fee.

      McQuesten
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The McQuesten property is located within the Keno Hill
      district. On October 20, 2008, the Corporation completed the exercise of
      an option to acquire from a third party the remaining 30% interest in the
      McQuesten property not already owned by the Corporation, issuing 210,000
      common shares valued at $315,000 and granting a net smelter return royalty
      to the optionor over certain McQuesten and proximal Keno Hill district
      claims ranging from 0.5% to 2%. The McQuesten

      property is also subject to a second separate net smelter
      return royalty of 2% under which the Corporation makes an annual advance
      royalty payment of $20,000 per year.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (c) 
    
      Other Keno Hill Properties
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Corporation’s other Keno Hill district properties
      include the historical Elsa tailings, and numerous others. A limited
      number of the mineral interests comprising certain of these properties are
      subject to granted or pending net smelter return royalties of 1%, in
      addition to the royalty provisions of the Subsidiary Agreement.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (d) 
    
      Brewery Creek
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      The Corporation’s 100% owned Brewery Creek property is
      located in Canada’s Yukon Territory, and is subject to two underlying
      royalty agreements with third parties. The first is a “sliding scale”
      royalty on the first 300,000 ounces of production from the property,
      payable on quarterly gold production on the basis of a sliding scale
      ranging from US$10 to US$40 per ounce based on the prevailing gold price.
      As of the cessation of gold production at Brewery Creek prior to its
      acquisition by the Corporation, royalties under this agreement had already
      been paid on 278,484 ounces of gold production. The second royalty is a 5%
      net profits royalty (after recapture of pre- production expenditures) on
      profits from gold production at Brewery Creek.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      In August 2009, the Corporation entered into an option
      agreement with a third party under which the third party has been granted
      exclusive rights to earn up to a 75% interest in the Brewery Creek
      property other than with respect to barite deposits, and earn a 50%
      interest in any barite deposits located on the property. The third party
      can earn the full 75% interest in the property excluding barite deposits
      by incurring aggregate non-barite-related exploration and development
      expenditures of at least $6 million and completing a non-barite bankable
      feasibility study by December 31, 2014. If the third party earns its full
      75% interest, the Corporation will have a one- time option to claw back a
      10% interest by paying a cash amount equal to 2.5 times the third party’s
      non-Barite related expenditures in excess of $4 million. The third party
      can earn the 50% barite interest by incurring $1 million in barite-related
      exploration expenditures by December 31, 2012, subject to the condition
      that it has also incurred at least $3.5 million in expenditures towards
      the non-barite interest.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    (e) 
    
      Impairment Review in Fiscal 2009
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      As at December 31, 2008, management undertook an
      impairment review of the carrying amount of the Corporation’s mineral
      properties. With respect to the Brewery Creek property, no significant
      exploration activity had been carried out since 2006, nor was any planned
      in the near term. While the Corporation had no intention to allow the
      Brewery Creek property to lapse, given the level of uncertainty at the
      time in the economic climate its carrying amount was determined to be
      unrecoverable and was written down to a nominal value of $1,000. The
      carrying amounts for all of the Corporation’s other mineral property
      interests were determined to be fully recoverable and therefore no
      additional impairment write-downs were required.
  
     
     
     
  
     
    
    
      Management carried out this review using its best
      estimates, based on assumptions that it believed reflected the most
      probable set of economic conditions and planned courses of action.
      Nonetheless, with respect to determining the value to which the Brewery
      Creek property in particular should be written down, the degree of
      variance between management’s best estimates and other reasonable
      assumptions was unusually high due to the degree of volatility present in
      the economic climate at the time. The degree of variance between
      management’s best estimate of the value to which Brewery Creek should be
      written down and other reasonably possible amounts, though indeterminate,
      was likely material.

As at December 31, 2008, management
undertook impairment reviews of the carrying amounts of the Corporation’s
intangible assets, all of which related to its consulting services segment. Due
to changes in management’s estimates of the time and costs required to complete
the underlying reclamation project services, the remaining unamortized carrying
amount for the reclamation project intangible asset was determined to be
unrecoverable and was written off. Due to the level of uncertainty at the time
in the economic climate world-wide, management reduced its estimate of the
future cash flows expected to be realized from the Corporation’s patents. As a
result, the carrying amounts for certain of the patents were determined to no
longer be fully recoverable, and were accordingly written down to their fair
values as estimated using an expected present value technique. The Corporation
therefore recognized write-downs of its intangible assets totaling $852,000, of
which $253,000 was in respect of its reclamation project assets and $599,000 was
in respect of its patent assets. 
Management carried out these reviews
using its best estimates, based on assumptions that it believed reflected the
most probable set of economic conditions and planned courses of action.
Nonetheless, with respect to determining the fair values of the Corporation’s
patents in particular, the degree of variance between management’s best
estimates and other reasonable assumptions was unusually high due to the degree
of volatility present in the economic climate at the time. The degree of
variance between management’s best estimate of the fair value of the patents and
other reasonably possible amounts, though indeterminate, was likely material.

      As described in note 5(a), under the Subsidiary Agreement
      ERDC is responsible for carrying out environmental care and maintenance at
      various sites within the UKHM properties, for a fixed annual fee adjusted
      each year for certain operating and inflationary factors and determined on
      a site-by-site basis. The portion of the site-by-site adjusted annual fee
      determination basis which is billable by ERDC reduces by 15% each year
      until all site-specific care and maintenance activities have been replaced
      by closure reclamation activities.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      Over the course of summer 2009 ERDC significantly
      advanced its development of the closure reclamation plan, one of the
      results of which was that the period of time required to receive
      acceptance and regulatory approval of the plan was anticipated to be
      longer than previously estimated. Accordingly, in performing its quarterly
      review of this contract as at June 30, 2009, management revised its
      estimates to reflect this longer period of time. As a result, a loss
      provision liability in respect of this contract was recognized in the
      Corporation’s consolidated balance sheet as at June 30, 2009 totaling
      $1,150,000, which provision was charged to consulting costs for the year
      then ended.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation
      reduced the balance of the loss provision liability by $237,000 as a
      result of a favourable re-assessment of the costs estimated to be incurred
      in meeting its future care and maintenance obligations under the
      Subsidiary Agreement. The resulting gain of $237,000 has been reflected as
      a reduction of consulting costs, as has the reduction arising due to loss
      realization during the period.

On October 2, 2008, the Corporation
entered into a silver purchase agreement with Silver Wheaton under which Silver
Wheaton will purchase 25% of the life of mine silver produced by the Corporation
from its Keno Hill district mineral properties. The agreement provides for the
Corporation to receive deposit payments from Silver Wheaton totaling US$50
million, plus a further payment of the lesser of US$3.90 (increasing by 1% per
annum after the third year of full production) and the prevailing market price
for each ounce of silver delivered. The agreement also provides that prior to
meeting an initial completion test based on production throughput, all deposit
payments received from Silver Wheaton can only be expended on the development
and construction of the Bellekeno mine, being one of the Corporation’s Keno Hill
district properties (see note 5(a), and note 17 with respect to restricted cash
and deposits).

      Under the agreement, the deposit balance is reduced on
      each silver delivery by the excess of the prevailing market value of the
      silver delivered over the per-ounce cash amount paid by Silver Wheaton at
      the time. After the initial 40 year term of the agreement, the Corporation
      is required to refund the balance of any deposit payments received and not
      yet reduced through silver deliveries. The Corporation would also be
      required to refund the balance of deposit payments received and not
      reduced down if Silver Wheaton exercised its right to terminate the
      agreement in an event of default by the Corporation, which would include a
      failure to meet certain Bellekeno mine construction milestones. The
      Corporation would be required to refund a pro-rata portion of the balance
      of the deposit not yet reduced to the extent the Bellekeno mine has not
      achieved a production rate of 400 tonnes of ore per day by December 31,
      2013.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      An initial deposit payment under the agreement of US$15
      million (CAD$18,210,000) was received by the Corporation in December 2008.
      During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation received further
      deposit payments totaling US$11,899,000 (CAD$12,172,000) deposit payments.
      The remaining US$23,101,000 is being paid on a monthly draw-down basis to
      fund the Bellekeno mine development and infrastructure and ore processing
      mill construction costs.

The Corporation’s asset retirement
obligations consist of costs expected to be required in respect of
presently-ongoing reclamation and closure activities at the Brewery Creek
property, and costs expected to be required in respect of future reclamation and
closure activities at the end of the life of the Bellekeno mine currently in
development. These activities include water treatment, land rehabilitation,
ongoing care and maintenance and other reclamation and closure related
requirements. 
As at June 30, 2010, the Corporation
has provided reclamation security totaling $2,483,000 (2009 – $1,397,000) to the
Government of Yukon in the form of term deposits held under safekeeping
agreements, which funds are included in the Corporation’s non-current restricted
cash and deposits. 
During the year ended June 30, 2010,
the Corporation recorded $807,000 (2009 - $293,000) for the fair value of
incremental reclamation obligations arising from the development and
construction activity undertaken during the period with respect to the Bellekeno
mine. 
The total undiscounted amount of the
estimated cash flows required to settle the asset retirement obligations is
estimated to be $2,035,000 (2009 – $976,000), which expenditures are expected to
be incurred substantially over the course of the next 15 years. In historically
determining the carrying value of the asset retirement obligations, the
Corporation has used a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of 4% per annum.

      Shareholders’ Equity
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
      The Corporation’s authorized share capital consists of an
      unlimited number of common shares, without par value.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
      Share capital transactions occurring during the years
      ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows:
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (a) 
    
      Effective October 23, 2008, the Corporation issued by way
      of private placement 3,500,000 flow- through shares on a brokered basis at
      $2.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $7,000,000. The agent to
      the private placement was paid a commission of 6% of the gross proceeds
      from the offering and received broker’s warrants to acquire 210,000
      non-flow through shares at any time until October 23, 2009 at a price of
      $2.00 per share. Net proceeds from the issuance were $6,484,335 after
      issuance costs comprised of the agent’s commission of $420,000, the fair
      value of the broker’s warrants granted of $33,600 and other issuance costs
      of $62,065, less the future income tax benefit of such costs of
      $155,000.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (b) 
    
      Effective March 17, 2009, the Corporation issued by way
      of private placement 3,428,572 flow- through shares on a non-brokered
      basis at $1.75 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $6,000,000. Net
      proceeds from the issuance were $5,899,000 after issuance cost comprised
      of legal and other costs of $101,000, less the future income tax benefit
      of such costs of $20,000.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (c) 
    
      During the year ended June 30, 2009, the Corporation
      renounced exploration expenditures deductible for Canadian income tax
      purposes of $7,000,000 in respect of the flow-through shares issued in
      October 2008 (see (a) above). The Corporation recognized a resultant
      future income tax liability of $2,100,000 arising from this renunciation,
      and reduced share capital by the same amount to recognize an additional
      cost of the issuance of the shares.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (d) 
    
      Effective December 23, 2009, the Corporation issued by
      way of private placement 2,375,000 flow- through common shares on a
      brokered basis at $4.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of
      $9,500,000. Net proceeds from the issuance were $9,056,000, after issuance
      costs comprised of the agents’ commission of $557,000 and other issuance
      costs of $78,000, less the future income tax benefit of such costs of
      $191,000.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (e) 
    
      Effective February 11, 2010, the Corporation issued
      7,350,000 common shares under a short form prospectus at $3.50 per share,
      for aggregate gross proceeds of $25,725,000. The underwriters were paid a
      commission of 7% of the gross proceeds from the offering. Net proceeds
      from the issuance were $24,035,000, after issuance costs comprised of the
      underwriters’ commission of $1,801,000 and other issuance costs of
      $613,000, less the future income tax benefit of such costs of
    $724,000.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (f) 
    
      During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation
      renounced exploration expenditures deductible for Canadian income tax
      purposes totaling $15,500,000 in respect of the flow-through common shares
      issued in March and December of 2009. The Corporation recognized a
      resultant future income tax liability totaling $4,650,000 arising from
      these renunciations, and reduced share capital by the same amount to
      recognize an additional cost of the issuance of the
  shares.

      The fair value of warrants issued during the year ended
      June 30, 2009 was determined under the Black- Scholes option pricing model
      based on their full term and using a risk-free interest rate of 2.6%, an
      expected volatility of 82% and no expected dividends.
  
     
     
  
    12. 
    
      Stock-Based Compensation
  
     
     
  
    
    
      The Corporation has a stock option plan that was most
      recently approved by its shareholders on December 12, 2008. Under the plan
      and at the discretion of the board of directors, the Corporation may grant
      stock options to directors, officers, employees and consultants. The
      maximum term of options granted under this plan is seven years, and other
      provisions including vesting and exercise price are determined at the
      discretion of the directors at the time of granting, subject to the
      requirement that the exercise price not be less than the market price of
      the common shares at the granting date. As at June 30, 2010, a total of
      4,795,750 options were outstanding under the plan (2009 – 3,651,100). The
      aggregate number of common shares issued or issuable on exercise of stock
      options granted under this plan cannot exceed 10% of the number of common
      shares issued and outstanding from time to time, and accordingly 523,143
      remain available for future grantings as at June 30, 2010.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      In addition, as at June 30, 2010 an additional 150,000
      stock options (2009 – 150,000) remained outstanding which were originally
      granted outside of the Corporation’s stock option plan and in accordance
      with the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      All stock options granted during the years ended June 30,
      2010 and 2009 carried exercise prices equal to the fair value of the
      common shares as at the granting date. Of the 1,432,000 stock options
      granted during the 2010 fiscal year (2009 – 635,000), a total of 1,382,000
      (2009 – nil) vest in tranches within two years of the date of grant, and
      the remaining 50,000 (2009 – 635,000) were fully vested on granting. The
      weighted average per-share fair value of options granted during 2010 was
      $1.91 (2009 – $0.99). The stock-based compensation expense recognized for
      the year in respect of options granted was $1,438,000 (2009 – $686,000),
      of which $980,000 (2009 – $561,000) has been charged to income and
      $458,000 (2009 – $125,000) has been capitalized to mineral
    properties.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      The fair value of options at the date of grant was
      estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming a

In addition, certain officers of a
subsidiary of the Corporation had been provided with an incentive plan under
which they could be issued over a period of up to four years an aggregate
maximum of 64,412 shares of the Corporation as bonus remuneration in the event
that their business unit achieved certain pre-set earnings targets. In
accordance with the terms of the plan, effective March 31, 2009 the right to

      respect of shares potentially issuable under this plan.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      Subsequent to June 30, 2010, a total of 350,000 incentive

      Goodwill
  
     
     
  
    
    
      As at December 31, 2008, management undertook an
      impairment review of the carrying amount of the Corporation’s goodwill,
      the full amount of which related to the mineral properties segment. Due to
      the level of uncertainty at the time in the economic climate world-wide,
      including the resultant increase in capital market risk aversion, and
      after considering the fair value of the mineral properties reporting unit
      taken as a whole, management determined that the current fair value of its
      recorded goodwill had been reduced to nil. As a result, the Corporation
      recognized an impairment write-down for the full carrying amount of its
      recorded goodwill, being $917,000.

The carrying amounts of the
Corporation’s accounts and other receivable and accounts payable and accrued
liabilities reasonably approximate their fair values. 
The fair values of all of the
Corporation’s financial instruments measured at June 30, 2010 constitute Level 2
measurements within the fair value hierarchy defined under Canadian GAAP. 
All bankers’ acceptances carried
initial maturity periods of three months or less, and their fair values have
been estimated by the Corporation by making reference to published yields for
such instruments. 
All term deposits carried initial
maturity periods of twelve months or less. Given their short term nature and low
investment risk, the Corporation has estimated that the carrying amounts of the
term deposits reasonably approximate their fair values.

      JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009 
  
  
    (figures in tables are expressed in thousands of dollars)
    
  

Of the Corporation’s restricted cash
and deposits at June 30, 2010 of $7,611,000 (2009 – $6,267,000), a total
$4,851,000 represents the balance of the Silver Wheaton deposit payments
received but not yet expended on the Bellekeno property (2009 – $4,651,000) (see
note 8). An additional $2,483,000 (2009 – $1,397,000) comprises security
provided to regulatory bodies under safekeeping agreements in accordance with
its various operating permits. This security is in respect of mine-site
reclamation at certain of the Corporation’s mineral properties, and is
releasable back to the Corporation as and when reclamation activities are
completed. The balance of the Corporation’s restricted cash and deposits
comprises security provided in respect of certain long-term operating lease
commitments. 
The Corporation recognized interest
income during the year ended June 30, 2010 totaling $88,000 (2009 – $224,000),
of which $3,000 (2009 – $74,000) represented interest income earned from the
Corporation’s held-to-maturity investments. The balance represents interest
income from all other sources, including yield income recognized on bankers’
acceptances. Given their short initial maturity periods and the high quality of
the issuing counterparties, trading gains and losses outside of
yield-at-inception returns on the Corporation’s bankers’ acceptances have been
insignificant. 
Financial Instrument Risk Exposure
Credit Risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial
loss to the Corporation if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its obligations. The Corporation’s maximum exposure to credit risk
at the balance sheet date under its financial instruments is summarized as
follows:

Substantially all of the Corporation’s
cash, demand deposits, bankers’ acceptances and term deposits are held with
major financial institutions in Canada, and management believes the exposure to
credit risk with respect to such institutions is not significant. Those
financial assets that potentially subject the Corporation to credit risk are
primarily receivables. Management actively monitors the Corporation’s exposure
to credit risk under its financial instruments, particularly with respect to
receivables, and has increased its focus on credit risk given the impact of the
recent economic climate on its customer base. The Corporation considers the risk
of material loss to be significantly mitigated due to the financial strength of
the parties from whom the receivables are due, including with respect to trade
accounts receivable as the Corporation’s major customers include government
organizations as well as substantial corporate entities. As at June 30, 2010 and
2009, no material provision had been recorded in respect of impaired
receivables. 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the
Corporation will not be able to meet its obligations associated with financial
liabilities. The Corporation has a planning and budgeting process in place by
which it anticipates and determines the funds required to support its normal
operating requirements as well as the growth and development of its mining
projects. The Corporation coordinates this planning and budgeting process with
its financing activities through the capital management process described in
note 18. Management has

increased its focus on liquidity risk
given the impact of the current economic climate on the availability of finance.
The Corporation’s financial liabilities are comprised of its accounts payable
and accrued liabilities, the contractual maturities of which at June 30, 2010
are summarized as follows:

Currency Risk 
The Corporation is exposed to currency
risk at the balance sheet date through the following financial assets and
liabilities, which are denominated in US dollars:

    $
     254 
     


  
    
    
      Based on the above net exposure at June 30, 2010, a 10%
      depreciation or appreciation of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar
      would result in an approximately $76,000 decrease or increase respectively
      in both net and comprehensive earnings. The Corporation currently has only
      limited exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian
      and US dollar as significantly all of its property, plant and equipment
      and mineral properties are located, and significantly all of its revenue
      is earned, in Canada. Accordingly, the Corporation has not employed any
      currency hedging programs during the current period.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      Interest Rate Risk
  
     
     
  
    
    
      The Corporation has no significant exposure at June 30,
      2010 to interest rate risk through its financial instruments.
  
     
     
  
    18. 
    
      Management of Capital
  
     
     
  
    
    
      The capital managed by the Corporation includes the
      components of shareholders’ equity as described in note 10. The
      Corporation is not subject to externally imposed capital
    requirements.
  
     
     
  
    
    
      The Corporation’s objectives of capital management are to
      create long-term value and economic returns for its shareholders. It does
      this by seeking to maximize the availability of finance to fund the growth
      and development of its mining projects, and to support the working capital
      required to maintain its ability to continue as a going concern. The
      Corporation manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in
      the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics
      of its assets, seeking to limit shareholder dilution and optimize its cost
      of capital while maintaining an acceptable level of risk. To maintain or
      adjust its capital structure, the Corporation considers all sources of
      finance reasonably available to it, including but not limited to issuance
      of new capital, issuance of new debt and the sale of assets in whole or in
      part, including mineral property interests. The Corporation’s overall
      strategy with respect to management of capital remains fundamentally
      unchanged from the year ended June 30, 2009, though for purposes of
      managing its capital structure the level of risk considered acceptable by
      management has been lowered given the impact of the current economic
      climate on the availability of finance.

    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  
  
    FOR THE YEARS ENDED
      JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009 
  
  
    (figures in tables are expressed in thousands of dollars)
    
  




  
    
    
      The Corporation’s two operating segments are consulting
      and project management services in respect of environmental permitting and
      compliance and site remediation and reclamation, and exploration and
      development of mineral properties. The operating results from ERDC’s
      provision of care and maintenance and closure reclamation services under
      the subsidiary agreement (see note 5(a)) are included in the consulting
      services segment. The corporate segment includes the Corporation’s
      executive head office and general corporate administration and activity.
      Inter-segment transactions are recorded at amounts that reflect normal
      third-party terms and conditions, with inter-segment profits eliminated
      from the cost base of the segment incurring the charge.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    
      During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation’s
      consulting services segment recorded revenues from two customers
      representing 10% or more of total revenue, in the amounts of $1,971,000
      and $493,000 (2009 – from two customers, in the amounts of $3,181,000 and
      $926,000). Substantially all of the Corporation’s capital assets are
      located in Canada.
  
     
     
     
  
    21. 
    
      Related Party Transactions
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (a) 
    
      In January 2009, NovaGold Resources Inc. (“NovaGold”)
      reduced its shareholding in the Corporation to nil, and as a consequence
      ceased to be a related party with significant influence over the
      Corporation. During the year ended June 30, 2009, and while it was a
      related party, the Corporation incurred technical service fees with
      NovaGold totaling $274,000, which were capitalized to mineral
      properties.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (b) 
    
      With respect to the Corporation’s December 23, 2009
      financing (see note 10(d)), a director and an executive officer of the
      Corporation participated in the offering, subscribing for a total of
      15,000 shares.
  
     
     
     
  
    
    (c) 
    
      During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation
      incurred $97,000 in respect of rent of office space (2009 – $95,000) under
      an agreement with Access Field Services, a company owned by certain
      individuals who are, or were at the time, executive officers of the
      Corporation and its subsidiary Access. At June 30, 2010, accounts payable
      and accrued liabilities include $5,400 due to Access Field Services (2009
      – $nil).
These transactions were in the normal
course of operations and are measured at the exchange amount, which is the
amount established and agreed to by the related parties. The resulting accounts
payable and accrued liabilities are payable currently under normal third-party
trade payable terms and conditions.

      Significant Differences Between Canadian and United
      States Accounting Principles
  
     
     
  
    
    
      Canadian GAAP varies in certain significant respects from
      principles and practices under US GAAP. The effect of the principal
      measurement differences on the Corporation’s consolidated financial
      statements as at and for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 are
      quantified below and described in the accompanying

    (a) 
    
      Under US GAAP, the Corporation would be required to
      expense as incurred exploration and development costs on a mineral
      property prior to completion of a definitive study which establishes
      commercially minable reserves on that property, as well as any costs of
      maintaining title subsequent to initial acquisition. Only the costs
      relating to initial acquisition of a mineral property asset would be
      capitalized. In addition, such expenditures would be classified as
      operating activities in the statement of cash
flows.



  
    ALEXCO RESOURCE CORP. 
  
  
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  
  
    FOR THE YEARS ENDED
      JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009 
  
  
    (figures in tables are expressed in thousands of dollars)
    
  




  
     
    (b) 
    
      Under US GAAP, any premium realized on the issuance of
      flow-through shares is required to be recorded as a liability pending
      renunciation of deductible expenditures to the subscribers. Upon
      renunciation, any difference between this liability and the resultant
      future income tax liability is recorded as a future income tax expense. As
      at June 30, 2009, the flow-through issuance completed in March 2009 was
      pending renunciation, and therefore for US GAAP purposes the Corporation
      recorded a $926,000 liability relating to the premium realized on issuance
      pending the renunciation of deductible expenditures to the subscribers. As
      at June 30, 2010, the renunciations in respect of all flow-through
      issuances to that date had been effected.
Impact of recently adopted United
States accounting pronouncements: 
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Statement 168, “The FASB Accounting
Standards Codification™ (“ASC”) and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles”, a replacement of FASB Statement 162, “The Hierarchy of
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”. This statement is now known as ASC
105. Effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009,
the ASC has become the source of authoritative US GAAP recognized by the FASB to
be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the
US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under authority of federal
securities laws are also sources of authoritative US GAAP for SEC registrants.
The ASC superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards.
The ASC was not intended to change US GAAP, but rather reorganize existing
guidance by accounting topic to allow easier identification of applicable
standards. References in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements to
US GAAP have been updated to reflect the Codification. 
In February 2008, the FASB issued ASC
Topic 820-10-15 (formerly FSP FAS 157-2), delaying the effective date of ASC
Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, (formerly FAS 157) to
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets and
liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
the financial statements on a recurring basis. Therefore, the requirements of
ASC Topic 820-10 have been applied to such non-financial assets and liabilities
beginning in this fiscal 2010. The effect of applying these requirements did not
impact the Corporation’s reported consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. 
In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC
Topic 805-10, “Business Combinations”, (formerly FAS 141(R)), to replace the
former FAS 141 prospectively effective for business combinations consummated
after the effective date of December 15, 2008. Early adoption was not permitted.
Under ASC Topic 805-10, business acquisitions must be accounted for under the
acquisition method, compared to the purchase method mandated by FAS 141. Also in
December 2007 and effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008,
the FASB issued ASC Topic 810-10-65, “Consolidation”, (formerly FAS 160) under
which the non-controlling interest must be measured at 100% of the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, compared to previous standards under
which it was measured at book value. For presentation and disclosure purposes,
non-controlling interests must be classified as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity. ASC Topic 810-10-65 also changed the manner in which
increases/decreases in ownership percentages are accounted for, as well as the
manner by which accumulated losses are attributed to non-controlling interests.
The provisions of ASC Topic 810-10-65 were to be applied prospectively with the
exception of the presentation and disclosure provisions, which were to be
applied for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early
adoption was not permitted. The adoption of these standards did not impact the
Corporation’s reported consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.
