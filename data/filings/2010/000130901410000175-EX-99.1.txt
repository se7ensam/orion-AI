Ballard Reports Audited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Results


For Immediate Release – March 10, 2010


VANCOUVER, CANADA– Ballard Power Systems (TSX: BLD; NASDAQ: BLDP) announced its financial results
for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2009 today. All amounts are in U.S.
dollars, unless otherwise noted.


Fourth Quarter 2009 Highlights






     
    •
     
    Fourth quarter revenue was $16.5 million, 13% lower than the same period last year, but
reflecting growth of 83% relative to the third quarter of 2009 and 35% of full-year
revenue.









     
    •
     
    Fourth quarter operating cash consumption1 was ($4.5) million, representing
positive cash contribution to the business, consistent with expectations.









     
    •
     
    Cash reserves were augmented by monetizing rights under the Share Purchase Agreement
(SPA) with Ford Motor Company relating to Ballard’s 19.9% equity interest in Automotive
Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. for total gross proceeds of approximately $44.5 million; $37
million received up front and an additional contingent payment of $7.5 million due upon
maturation of the SPA.





Full Year 2009 Highlights






     
    •
     
    Generated revenues of $46.7 million for the full year, a decline of 22% or $12.9 million
from 2008. Over half of this decline was due to the exit from automotive and residential
cogeneration development programs.









     
    •
     
    Reduced the cost base by approximately $18.0 million, or 30%, on an annual run rate
basis, primarily through restructuring activities in March and August.









     
    •
     
    Reduced operating expenses, excluding restructuring, acquisition and related expenses,
by 22% or $12.5 million, to $44.6 million.









     
    •
     
    Reduced operating cash consumption1 by 6% to $27.5 million for the full year.









     
    •
     
    Normalized net loss1 was ($39.3) million or ($0.47) per share, representing
an improvement of $14.6 million or ($0.17) per share from 2008.









     
    •
     
    Ended 2009 with cash reserves of $82.2 million.









     
    •
     
    Subsequent to year end, Ballard closed a sale-and-leaseback agreement
with Madison Pacific Properties Inc. (TSX: MPC) (www.madisonpacific.ca). Ballard
sold its head office building site in Burnaby, British Columbia in return for gross
cash proceeds of C$20.8 million (US$20.0 million) and entered into an initial
fifteen-year lease agreement for the same property.





John Sheridan, President and CEO said “Our audited 2009 financial results are in line with the
preliminary, unaudited results, announced on February 3, 2010. With the decisive actions we have
taken to streamline our cost base, further strengthen our solid balance sheet, and solidify our
market positioning as shown by our high order volumes, Ballard is well-positioned for annual
revenue growth in excess of 35% in 2010 and positive EBITDA performance during 2011.”

Full Year 2009 Financial Results


We generated revenues of $46.7 million in 2009, a decline of 22%, or $12.9 million from 2008.
Revenues were slightly lower than our revised guidance target of $50.0 million due to the delay of
expected 2009 fuel cell bus shipments and First Energy distributed power generator project
milestones to 2010.


We reduced operating cash consumption1 in 2009 by 6% to $27.5 million, down from $29.3
million in 2008, essentially meeting our guidance target of $27.0 million. The improvement was due
primarily to a reset of our operating cost base through restructuring activities in March and
August, which offset margin declines as a result of the decline in revenues.


We ended 2009 with cash reserves of $82.2 million. Cash reserves were augmented in December 2009
through the monetization of our rights under the Share Purchase Agreement with Ford relating to our
19.9% equity investment in AFCC.


Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased to $46.7 million, or 22%, compared to
$59.6 million for 2008 due primarily to declines in our supporting Contract Automotive business
segment of $10.0 million. Fuel Cell Products revenues declined $3.5 million, or 13%, from 2008 as
increases in product and service revenues of $1.7 million were offset by declines in engineering
development revenues of $5.2 million primarily as a result of our decision to discontinue
operations in EBARA BALLARD in May 2009. Fuel Cell Products product and service revenues increased
8% to $24.1 million driven by an increase in fuel cell bus shipments as a result of the B.C.
Transit 2010 Olympic, Transport of London, and Advanced Public Transportation System BV fuel cell
bus programs. In addition, increases in backup power market revenues driven by work completed on
the First Energy distributed power generator project and increased unit shipments as a result of
the successful completion of the hydrogen unit product acceptance milestone with ACME supported
overall revenue growth of Fuel Cell Products product and service revenue. These increases were
partially offset by lower shipments in the material handing market and by lower residential
cogeneration market revenues.


Contract Automotive revenues decreased 52% to $9.2 million due to lower shipments of light-duty
automotive fuel cell modules to AFCC, Daimler and Ford, combined with lower testing and engineering
services provided to AFCC. In addition, the absence of engineering development revenues as a result
of the elimination of light-duty automotive fuel cell program work subsequent to the closing of the
AFCC Transaction on January 31, 2008 contributed to the overall decline in Contract Automotive
revenue.


Material Products revenues increased 5% to $13.4 million due to increased volumes of fuel cell GDL
shipments combined with the maintenance of carbon friction material product revenues as price
increases offset the impact of lower volumes as a result of the slowdown in the U.S. automotive
sector during the first half of 2009.


Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to $3.3 million, or ($0.04) per share,
compared with net income of $31.5 million, or $0.37 per share, in 2008. The net loss for 2009
includes a gain on sale of assets resulting from the AFCC Monetization of $34.3 million,

restructuring and related expenses of $6.2 million relating to a 20% workforce reduction initiated
in August 2009 and a 7% workforce reduction initiated in March 2009, and a non-cash gain (net of
equity losses prior to dissolution) of $8.4 million related to our decision to discontinue
operations in EBARA Ballard Corporation on May 24, 2009. The net income for 2008 includes a gain on
sale of assets of $96.8 million related to the AFCC Transaction, partially offset by a write-down
of a non-core investment in Chrysalix of $3.0 million.


Our normalized net loss1 for 2009 decreased $14.6 million, or 27%, to $39.3 million, or
($0.47) per share, compared with a normalized net loss of $53.9 million, or ($0.64) per share, for
2008. Reductions in operating expenses (excluding restructuring, acquisition and related expenses)
of $12.5 million primarily as a result of our workforce reduction and cost optimization
initiatives, combined with increases in investment and other income of $8.9 million primarily as a
result of increases in foreign exchange gains and a curtailment gain and improved investment
returns related to our employee future benefit plans, more than offset the decline in revenues
(including engineering development revenue) and the related gross margin impacts of $6.2 million.


Operating cash consumption1 for 2009 decreased 6% to $27.5 million, compared to $29.3
million for 2008. The $1.7 million improvement in operating cash consumption was driven by
improvements in cash flow from operating activities (net of restructuring and related payments) of
$3.3 million partially offset by increased investment (net of proceeds on sale) in building
manufacturing capacity. The improvement in cash flow from operations was primarily a result of our
workforce reduction and cost optimization initiatives in 2009, which more than offset the impacts
of the decline in revenue and related gross margin and the decline in working capital improvements.
The decline in working capital improvements of $0.4 million were driven primarily by a drawdown of
deferred revenue on our First Energy distributed power generator project combined with reduced
improvements in inventory requirements, which more than offset improvements in accounts receivable
due primarily to increased customer collections on our B.C. Transit 2010 Olympic fuel cell bus
program and light-duty automotive shipments.

Endnotes:

1 Normalized net loss and operating cash consumption are non-GAAP measures used to
assist in assessing Ballard’s financial performance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized
meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures
presented by other companies. Normalized net loss measures our net loss after excluding items that
are unusual in nature or do not reflect the normal continued operating activity of the business.
Gains on sale of assets, write-downs of investments, restructuring and related expenses, equity
income (loss) in associated companies, and acquisition and related costs are either not considered
part of our core activities, or are expected to occur infrequently. Therefore we have removed these
items in our calculation of normalized net loss. Operating cash consumption measures the amount of
cash required to fund the operating activities of our business (net of restructuring and related
costs) and excludes financing and investing activities except for capital lease payments and
additions, net of proceeds on sale, of plant and equipment.
