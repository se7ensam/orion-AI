 Exhibit 99.1 
 

 
 AEGON shares to be delisted from Tokyo Stock Exchange  THE HAGUE – AEGON’s common shares are scheduled to be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on March 27th, 2010. All trading in AEGON common shares will cease from that date. 
This follows the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s decision to approve AEGON’s application for a delisting, which was filed in February.  AEGON shares continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam, the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.  As previously announced, AEGON applied for a delisting after deciding the volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange did not justify the related
expense.
