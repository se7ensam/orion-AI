Jean Cahuzac, Chief Executive Officer, said: 
“Several factors have contributed to a very strong quarterly performance. Our project teams have delivered outstanding execution on several major
contracts, successful resolution of claims and variation orders on ongoing projects, conventional activity has continued to strengthen and our joint ventures have made a good contribution. 
Acergy’s capacity to deliver this performance results in large part from our focus on cost optimisation and our determination to invest through the
cycle in our people and assets. Our acquisition of Acergy Borealis, in the quarter, is already providing access to opportunities in the high-end deepwater SURF market.”

 Operating Review 
First Quarter  Territory 1:
 Acergy Northern Europe and Canada – Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $90.6 million (Q1
2009: $138.1 million) reflecting lower activity levels, as anticipated, in an ongoing challenging market environment and fewer projects in installation phase, partly offset by good operational progress on DONG Siri and Deep Panuke and the completion
of the Maersk Lochranza Project. Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.4 million (Q1 2009: net operating income of $1.5 million) reflecting lower activity levels due to current market conditions and lower vessel
utilisation. Commercial negotiations regarding claims and variation orders on the Marathon Volund Project continue.  Acergy Asia and
Middle East – Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $87.4 million (Q1 2009: $47.1 million) reflecting good progress on the Pluto and BHP Pyrenees Projects. Net operating income from continuing operations for the
quarter was $20.7 million (Q1 2009: $12.6 million) reflecting good performance on the Pluto and BHP Pyrenees Projects, together with an improved contribution from the SapuraAcergy joint venture. 
Territory 2:  Acergy Africa and
Mediterranean – Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $341.7 million (Q1 2009: $228.0 million) reflecting continued good operational progress on a number of major projects: Block 15, Angola LNG, EPC4A, and PazFlor
and a good contribution from Sonamet, which remained fully consolidated during the quarter although classified as an asset held for sale. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $91.0 million (Q1 2009: $37.0 million)
reflecting good operational and project performance across the project portfolio, including Block 15, EPC4A, Angola LNG, PazFlor and Sonamet, and good utilisation of Acergy Polaris, which was in dry-dock for part of the first quarter of
fiscal year 2009.  Acergy North America and Mexico – Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.5
million (Q1 2009: $4.3 million). Net operating loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $3.7 million (Q1 2009: net operating income of $4.6 million) reflecting the segment’s operating cost base which was not covered by project
activity.  Acergy South America - Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $54.9 million (Q1 2009:
$85.3 million) reflecting anticipated lower activity levels due to the prior completion of the Frade SURF Project partly offset by the four ships on long-term service agreements to Petrobras, which achieved full utilisation during the quarter and
the contribution from the Roncador Manifold Project. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $5.1 million (Q1 2009: $7.5 million) reflecting lower activity levels partly offset by strong performance from Acergy
Harrier, Acergy Condor, Pertinacia and Polar Queen.  Acergy Corporate: 
Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.7 million (Q1 2009: $0.3 million). Net operating loss from continuing operations for the
quarter was $10.9 million (Q1 2009: net operating income of $8.1 million) primarily due to the lower utilisation of corporate vessels, including Acergy Discovery, Acergy Eagle due to dry-dock during the quarter, the fire on Acergy
Falcon while in dry-dock, as well as higher professional fees arising from legal restructuring and organisational optimisation, partially offset by a strong contribution from the SHL joint venture and a modest contribution from NKT Flexibles.
 Discontinued operations  Net
income from discontinued operations for the first quarter was $5.0 million (Q1 2009: $1.9 million) due to the positive contribution from the Mexilhao Trunkline Project. 
Asset Development  In December, Acergy
announced the acquisition of Acergy Borealis, a versatile deepwater ship for operations in challenging and harsh environments worldwide. Final completion and operational delivery of the ship is scheduled for the first half of 2012. Total
costs, upon delivery, are expected to be less than $500m, which will be funded entirely from the Company’s existing cash resources.

 The Sonamet joint venture remained fully consolidated as at February 28, 2010 although it continues
to be classified as ‘Assets held for sale’. After the completion of the sale and transfer of shares the business will be deconsolidated from Acergy’s financials and its future results will be reported as share of results of associates
and joint ventures.  During the quarter, a fire occurred on Acergy Falcon while in dry-dock. No material impact on earnings is
expected, although the vessel was not available for work during the quarter.  Financial Review 
First Quarter  Revenue from
continuing operations for the first quarter was $576 million (Q1 2009: $503 million) primarily reflecting good activity levels in West Africa and Asia Pacific partly offset by lower activity levels in the North Sea and Brazil. 
Gross profit was $147 million (Q1 2009: $115 million) reflecting higher activity levels and strong operating performance driven by good project
execution, particularly in West Africa and Asia Pacific.  Administrative expenses were $64 million (Q1 2009: $53 million) due to higher
professional fees arising from legal restructuring and organisational optimisation and the effect of foreign currency translation. 
Acergy’s share of results of associates and joint ventures was $18 million (Q1 2009: $10 million) reflecting a strong contribution from Seaway Heavy
Lifting, an improved positive contribution from SapuraAcergy and a positive albeit lower contribution from NKT Flexibles.  The Adjusted EBITDA
margin from continuing operations for the three months was 23.5% (Q1 2009: 20.2%). The Adjusted EBITDA margin from total operations for the three months was 23.2% (Q1 2009: 20.0%). 
Other gains and losses were a loss of $20 million (Q1 2009: loss of $2 million) primarily reflecting the effect of foreign exchange translation on
short-term Euro inter-company and cash balances and realised hedging losses arising from the weakened Euro in the quarter.  Income before
taxes from continuing operations for the first quarter was $76 million (Q1 2009: $62 million) reflecting good operational performance, a higher contribution from associates and joint ventures and good vessel utilisation. This was partly offset by
lower activity levels in the North Sea and Brazil, higher administrative expenses and other losses arising from foreign exchange movements. 
Taxation for the quarter was $23 million (Q1 2009: $22 million) resulting in an effective tax rate for the quarter of 31% (Q1 2009: 36%) reflecting the
current geographical portfolio mix of our business. The underlying effective tax rate for the Group was 36% in the quarter. During the reporting period resolution of a number of ongoing audits were achieved. As a consequence certain provisions were
released in the quarter.  Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $53 million (Q1 2009: $39 million). Net income from
total operations for the first quarter was $58 million (Q1 2009: $41 million).  The cash and cash equivalents position at the quarter end was
$667 million (November 30, 2009: $908 million) reflecting working capital outflows and the initial capital expenditure on Acergy Borealis, which will be funded entirely from the Company’s existing cash resources. Deferred revenue at the
quarter end stood at $232 million (November 30, 2009: $280 million).  At February 28, 2010, Acergy S.A. held directly 10,741,750 treasury
shares representing 5.51% of the total number of issued shares, as well as indirectly holding 879,121 treasury shares, representing 0.45% of the total number of issued shares. Total shares in issue were 194,953,972, including treasury shares.

 Backlog 
Backlog for continuing operations as at February 28, 2010 was approximately $2.5 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion is expected to be
executed in the fiscal year 2010. This backlog figure does not include the backlog relating to associates and joint ventures.

Trading Outlook  A stronger oil price
and more stable macro environment are inspiring greater confidence in our industry. We have continued to see increased tendering activity worldwide. However, for shorter-term SURF work, particularly in the UK North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the
pricing environment remains competitive.  We see more activity in the Conventional market in West Africa this year and we expect this market
to continue to remain strong in the short and medium-term.  A number of the major SURF contracts, delayed during 2009, are expected to come to
market award in the next few months. The offshore installation phase of most of these new SURF projects is expected to commence beyond 2011. 
The trend will be for SURF projects to continue to increase in size and complexity which will contribute to substantial industry growth in the
medium-term. Acergy is well placed to combine our competitive strengths of high calibre engineering and project management skills with our high quality assets to capture these future growth opportunities.

(a)

Adjusted
 EBITDA: The Group calculates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (adjusted earnings before interest, income taxation, depreciation and amortisation) as net income from continuing
operations plus finance costs, other gains and losses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude investment income and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing
operations is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from continuing operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are important indicators of our operational strength and the
performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations have not been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB nor as adopted for use
in the European Union. These non-IFRS measures provide management with a meaningful comparison amongst our various regions, as they eliminate the effects of financing and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations may also be a
useful ratio to compare our performance to our competitors and is widely used by shareholders and analysts following the Group’s performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations as presented by the
Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Such supplementary adjustments to EBITDA may not be in accordance with current practices or the rules and regulations adopted by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) that apply to reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the SEC may require that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations be presented differently in filings
made with the SEC than as presented in this release, or not be presented at all. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations are not measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative
to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS), as a measure of the Group’s operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of the Group’s liquidity.
The reconciliation of the Group’s net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is included in this release. This release also includes a supplemental calculation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing
operations calculated as net operating income from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortisation and impairment charges on property, plant and equipment and intangibles. Management believes that this supplemental presentation of Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations is also useful as it is more in line with the presentation of similarly titled measures by companies within Acergy’s peer group and therefore believes it to be a helpful calculation for those evaluating
companies within Acergy’s industry. Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations is calculated as per methodology outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA for total operations is the total of continuing operations and discontinued operations. 
 Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements made in this announcement may include
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use of words like “anticipate,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “forecast”, “project,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” and similar expressions. These
statements include, but are not limited to, statements as to the approximate value of the awarded contracts, continued commercial negotiations relating to the Marathon Volund Project, the timing of the final completion and operational delivery of
Acergy Borealis, the impact on earnings resulting from the fire on Acergy Falcon, expectations regarding our backlog and pre-backlog, and statements contained in the “Trading Outlook” section, including our visibility for
2010, the anticipation of increased activity in the Conventional market in West Africa, the anticipation that delayed major SURF contracts will come to market and the timing of the offshore installation phase of such projects, the increase in
tendering activity in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the expectation that the Conventional market in West Africa will remain very strong in the medium-term, the expectation for SURF contracts to increase in size and complexity in the
medium-term and our ability to capture future growth opportunities. The forward-looking statements reflect our current views and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The following factors, and others which are discussed in our
public filings and submissions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are among those that may cause actual and future results and trends to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: our ability to recover costs on
significant projects; the general economic conditions and competition in the markets and businesses in which we operate; our relationship with significant clients; the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or governmental enquiries;
uncertainties inherent in operating internationally; the timely delivery of ships on order and the timely completion of ship conversion programmes; the impact of laws and regulations; and operating hazards, including spills and environmental damage.
Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

$0.27. This is said to be anti-dilutive and is therefore not included in the calculation.
