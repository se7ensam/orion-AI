    "improvements": "**Improvement Suggestions**\n\n### 1. Node Types and Properties\n\n*   **Company**: Add `industry`, `country`, and `foundingDate` properties to provide more context about the company.\n    ```cypher\nCREATE (c:Company {name: \"Santander UK plc\", cik: \"0001087711\", industry: \"Banking\", country: \"UK\", foundingDate: \"1990-01-01\"})\n```\n*   **Person**: Add `jobTitle`, `email`, and `phoneNumber` properties to store relevant contact information.\n    ```cypher\nCREATE (p:Person {name: \"John Doe\", email: \"john.doe@example.com\", phoneNumber: \"+1234567890\"})\n```\n\n### 2. Relationship Types and Properties\n\n*   **OWNS**: Add a `startDate` and `endDate` property to specify the time period of ownership.\n    ```cypher\nMATCH (c1:Company {name: \"Santander UK plc\", cik: \"0001087711\"}),\n        (c2:Company {name: \"ABC Ltd.\", cik: \"0001234567\"})\nCREATE (c1)-[:OWNS]->(c2)\n```\n*   **SUBSIDIARY_OF**: Add a `subsidaryName` property to store the name of the subsidiary.\n    ```cypher\nMATCH (p:Person {name: \"John Doe\"}),\n        (c:Company {name: \"ABC Ltd.\", cik: \"0001234567\"})\nCREATE (p)-[:WORKS_AT]->(c)\n```\n\n### 3. Indexes for Better Query Performance\n\n*   Create an index on the `cik` property of the `Company` node to improve query performance when filtering by company ID.\n    ```cypher\nCREATE INDEX ON :Company(cik)\n```\n*   Create a composite index on the `name` and `industry` properties of the `Company` node to improve query performance when filtering by company name or industry.\n    ```cypher\nCREATE INDEX ON :Company(name, industry)\n```\n\n### 4. Data Structure Optimizations\n\n*   Consider using a separate node for each event attended by a person, rather than creating multiple relationships from a single person node.\n    ```cypher\nCREATE (e:Event {name: \"Annual Meeting\"})\nCREATE (p:Person {name: \"John Doe\"})\nCREATE (p)-[:ATTENDS]->(e)\n```\n*   Consider using a separate node for each sector, rather than creating multiple relationships from a single company node.\n    ```cypher\nCREATE (s:Sector {name: \"Banking\"})\nCREATE (c:Company {name: \"Santander UK plc\", cik: \"0001087711\"})\nCREATE (c)-[:BELONGS_TO_SECTOR]->(s)\n```\n\n### 5. Missing Relationships that Could be Valuable\n\n*   **HAS_EVENT**: Consider adding a `date` property to specify the date of the event.\n    ```cypher\nMATCH (e:Event {name: \"Annual Meeting\"})\nCREATE (p:Person {name: \"John Doe\"})\nCREATE (p)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e)\n```\n*   **SUBSIDIARY_OF**: Consider adding a `subsidaryName` property to store the name of the subsidiary.\n    ```cypher\nMATCH (c1:Company {name: \"Santander UK plc\", cik: \"0001087711\"}),\n        (c2:Company {name: \"ABC Ltd.\", cik: \"0001234567\"})\nCREATE (c1)-[:SUBSIDIARY_OF]->(c2)\n```\n*   **WORKS_AT**: Consider adding a `department` property to store the department of employment.\n    ```cypher\nMATCH (p:Person {name: \"John Doe\"}),\n        (c:Company {name: \"ABC Ltd.\", cik: \"0001234567\"})\nCREATE (p)-[:WORKS_AT]->(c)\n```\n*   **BELONGS_TO_SECTOR**: Consider adding a `sectorName` property to store the name of the sector.\n    ```cypher\nMATCH (c1:Company {name: \"Santander UK plc\", cik: \"0001087711\"}),\n        (s:Sector {name: \"Banking\"})\nCREATE (c1)-[:BELONGS_TO_SECTOR]->(s)\n```",
