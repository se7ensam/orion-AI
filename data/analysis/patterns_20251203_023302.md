Here are the improved regex patterns for extracting person names, job titles, company relationships, and event information:

**1. Person Names (Executives, Directors, Signatories)**

Regex Pattern: `\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\b`

Explanation: This pattern matches one or more words that start with a capital letter and are followed by lowercase letters. It allows for multiple names to be separated by spaces.

Example Matches:

* `webmaster@www.sec.gov` (matches "Webmaster")
* `Santander UK plc` (matches "Santander" and "UK plc")
* `Cleary Gottlieb` (matches "Cleary" and "Gottlieb")

**2. Job Titles**

Regex Pattern: `\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\b`

Explanation: This pattern is the same as the one for person names, but it can also match job titles that are not part of a company name.

Example Matches:

* `SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION` (matches "Securities" and "Exchange Commission")
* `Washington, D.C.` (matches "Washington" and "D.C.")

**3. Company Relationships**

Regex Pattern: `(Former|Current|Previous) \b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\b`

Explanation: This pattern matches words that indicate a company relationship, such as "Former", "Current", or "Previous", followed by a company name.

Example Matches:

* `Former CONFORMED NAME` (matches "Former")
* `Current FILER` (matches "Current")
* `Previous FILER` (matches "Previous")

**4. Event Information**

Regex Pattern: `\b\d{1,2}(\d{1,2})\d{4}\b`

Explanation: This pattern matches dates in the format of MMDDYYYY.

Example Matches:

* `20100111` (matches January 11, 2010)
* `20100204` (matches February 4, 2010)

**Additional Patterns**

Regex Pattern for FILER: `\bFILER:\s*(.*)\b`

Explanation: This pattern matches the word "FILER" followed by any characters until a newline character.

Example Matches:

* `FILER: COMPANY DATA:` (matches "FILER:" and "COMPANY DATA:")
* `FILER: BUSINESS ADDRESS:` (matches "FILER:" and "BUSINESS ADDRESS:")

Regex Pattern for FORM TYPE: `\bFORM TYPE:\s*(.*)\b`

Explanation: This pattern matches the word "FORM TYPE" followed by any characters until a newline character.

Example Matches:

* `FORM TYPE: 6-K` (matches "FORM TYPE:" and "6-K")
* `FORM TYPE: 8-K` (matches "FORM TYPE:" and "8-K")

These patterns can be used to extract the required information from the filing content. Note that these patterns may not match all possible cases, and you may need to adjust them based on the specific requirements of your project.
