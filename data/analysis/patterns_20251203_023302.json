    "suggestions": "Here are the improved regex patterns for extracting person names, job titles, company relationships, and event information:\n\n**1. Person Names (Executives, Directors, Signatories)**\n\nRegex Pattern: `\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b`\n\nExplanation: This pattern matches one or more words that start with a capital letter and are followed by lowercase letters. It allows for multiple names to be separated by spaces.\n\nExample Matches:\n\n* `webmaster@www.sec.gov` (matches \"Webmaster\")\n* `Santander UK plc` (matches \"Santander\" and \"UK plc\")\n* `Cleary Gottlieb` (matches \"Cleary\" and \"Gottlieb\")\n\n**2. Job Titles**\n\nRegex Pattern: `\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b`\n\nExplanation: This pattern is the same as the one for person names, but it can also match job titles that are not part of a company name.\n\nExample Matches:\n\n* `SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION` (matches \"Securities\" and \"Exchange Commission\")\n* `Washington, D.C.` (matches \"Washington\" and \"D.C.\")\n\n**3. Company Relationships**\n\nRegex Pattern: `(Former|Current|Previous) \\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b`\n\nExplanation: This pattern matches words that indicate a company relationship, such as \"Former\", \"Current\", or \"Previous\", followed by a company name.\n\nExample Matches:\n\n* `Former CONFORMED NAME` (matches \"Former\")\n* `Current FILER` (matches \"Current\")\n* `Previous FILER` (matches \"Previous\")\n\n**4. Event Information**\n\nRegex Pattern: `\\b\\d{1,2}(\\d{1,2})\\d{4}\\b`\n\nExplanation: This pattern matches dates in the format of MMDDYYYY.\n\nExample Matches:\n\n* `20100111` (matches January 11, 2010)\n* `20100204` (matches February 4, 2010)\n\n**Additional Patterns**\n\nRegex Pattern for FILER: `\\bFILER:\\s*(.*)\\b`\n\nExplanation: This pattern matches the word \"FILER\" followed by any characters until a newline character.\n\nExample Matches:\n\n* `FILER: COMPANY DATA:` (matches \"FILER:\" and \"COMPANY DATA:\")\n* `FILER: BUSINESS ADDRESS:` (matches \"FILER:\" and \"BUSINESS ADDRESS:\")\n\nRegex Pattern for FORM TYPE: `\\bFORM TYPE:\\s*(.*)\\b`\n\nExplanation: This pattern matches the word \"FORM TYPE\" followed by any characters until a newline character.\n\nExample Matches:\n\n* `FORM TYPE: 6-K` (matches \"FORM TYPE:\" and \"6-K\")\n* `FORM TYPE: 8-K` (matches \"FORM TYPE:\" and \"8-K\")\n\nThese patterns can be used to extract the required information from the filing content. Note that these patterns may not match all possible cases, and you may need to adjust them based on the specific requirements of your project.",
