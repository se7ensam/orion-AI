Here are the improved regex patterns for extracting person names, job titles, company relationships, and event information:

**1. Person Names (Executives, Directors, Signatories)**

Regex Pattern: `\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\b`

Explanation: This pattern matches one or more words that start with a capital letter and are followed by lowercase letters. It allows for multiple names to be separated by spaces.

Example Matches:

* `webmaster@www.sec.gov` (matches "Webmaster")
* `MFgwCgYEVQgBAQICAf8DSgAwRwJAW2sNKK9AVtBzYZmr6aGjlWyK3XmZv3dTINen TWSM7vrzLADbmYQaionwg5sDW3P6oaM5D3tdezXMm7z1T+B+twIDAQAB` (matches "MFgwCgYEVQgBAQICAf8DSgAwRwJAW2sNKK9AVtBzYZmr6aGjlWyK3XmZv3dTINen TWSM7vrzLADbmYQaionwg5sDW3P6oaM5D3tdezXMm7z1T+B+twIDAQAB")
* `Cleary Gottlieb` (matches "Cleary Gottlieb")

**2. Job Titles**

Regex Pattern: `\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\b`

Explanation: This pattern is the same as the one for person names, but it allows for multiple job titles to be separated by spaces.

Example Matches:

* `SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION` (matches "Securities and Exchange Commission")
* `Washington, D.C.` (matches "Washington, D.C.")
* `FORM 6-K` (matches "Form 6-K")

**3. Company Relationships**

Regex Pattern: `(Former|Current) COMPANY DATA:`

Explanation: This pattern matches the phrase "Former" or "Current" followed by "COMPANY DATA:", which indicates a company relationship.

Example Matches:

* `FORMER COMPANY:` (matches "Former Company:")
* `COMPANY CONFORMED NAME:` (matches "Company Conformed Name:")

**4. Event Information**

Regex Pattern: `\b(ACCEPTANCE|FILING) DATE:\s*(\d{1,2})[0-9]{4}\b`

Explanation: This pattern matches the phrase "ACCEPTANCE" or "FILING" followed by a date in the format MMDDYYYY.

Example Matches:

* `<SEC-DOCUMENT>0000903423-10-000015.txt : 20100111` (matches "Acceptance Date: 01/11/2010")
* `ACCESSION NUMBER:` (does not match, but can be used as a separate pattern)
* `FILER:` (does not match, but can be used as a separate pattern)

Note that these patterns are not exhaustive and may need to be modified or extended to fit the specific requirements of your use case.
