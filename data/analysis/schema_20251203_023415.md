## Results

**Improvement Suggestions**

### 1. Node Types and Properties

*   **Company**: Add `industry`, `country`, and `foundingDate` properties to provide more context about the company.
    ```cypher
CREATE (c:Company {name: "Santander UK plc", cik: "0001087711", industry: "Banking", country: "UK", foundingDate: "1990-01-01"})
```
*   **Person**: Add `jobTitle`, `email`, and `phoneNumber` properties to store relevant contact information.
    ```cypher
CREATE (p:Person {name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com", phoneNumber: "+1234567890"})
```

### 2. Relationship Types and Properties

*   **OWNS**: Add a `startDate` and `endDate` property to specify the time period of ownership.
    ```cypher
MATCH (c1:Company {name: "Santander UK plc", cik: "0001087711"}),
        (c2:Company {name: "ABC Ltd.", cik: "0001234567"})
CREATE (c1)-[:OWNS]->(c2)
```
*   **SUBSIDIARY_OF**: Add a `subsidaryName` property to store the name of the subsidiary.
    ```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {name: "John Doe"}),
        (c:Company {name: "ABC Ltd.", cik: "0001234567"})
CREATE (p)-[:WORKS_AT]->(c)
```

### 3. Indexes for Better Query Performance

*   Create an index on the `cik` property of the `Company` node to improve query performance when filtering by company ID.
    ```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Company(cik)
```
*   Create a composite index on the `name` and `industry` properties of the `Company` node to improve query performance when filtering by company name or industry.
    ```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Company(name, industry)
```

### 4. Data Structure Optimizations

*   Consider using a separate node for each event attended by a person, rather than creating multiple relationships from a single person node.
    ```cypher
CREATE (e:Event {name: "Annual Meeting"})
CREATE (p:Person {name: "John Doe"})
CREATE (p)-[:ATTENDS]->(e)
```
*   Consider using a separate node for each sector, rather than creating multiple relationships from a single company node.
    ```cypher
CREATE (s:Sector {name: "Banking"})
CREATE (c:Company {name: "Santander UK plc", cik: "0001087711"})
CREATE (c)-[:BELONGS_TO_SECTOR]->(s)
```

### 5. Missing Relationships that Could be Valuable

*   **HAS_EVENT**: Consider adding a `date` property to specify the date of the event.
    ```cypher
MATCH (e:Event {name: "Annual Meeting"})
CREATE (p:Person {name: "John Doe"})
CREATE (p)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e)
```
*   **SUBSIDIARY_OF**: Consider adding a `subsidaryName` property to store the name of the subsidiary.
    ```cypher
MATCH (c1:Company {name: "Santander UK plc", cik: "0001087711"}),
        (c2:Company {name: "ABC Ltd.", cik: "0001234567"})
CREATE (c1)-[:SUBSIDIARY_OF]->(c2)
```
*   **WORKS_AT**: Consider adding a `department` property to store the department of employment.
    ```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {name: "John Doe"}),
        (c:Company {name: "ABC Ltd.", cik: "0001234567"})
CREATE (p)-[:WORKS_AT]->(c)
```
*   **BELONGS_TO_SECTOR**: Consider adding a `sectorName` property to store the name of the sector.
    ```cypher
MATCH (c1:Company {name: "Santander UK plc", cik: "0001087711"}),
        (s:Sector {name: "Banking"})
CREATE (c1)-[:BELONGS_TO_SECTOR]->(s)
```
