    "improvements": "**Improvement Suggestions**\n\n### 1. Node Types and Properties\n\n*   **Company**: Consider adding more relevant properties, such as:\n    *   `industry`: a string representing the company's industry (e.g., \"Financial Services\")\n    *   `foundingDate`: a date representing the company's founding year\n    *   `headquarters`: a location representing the company's headquarters city and country\n*   **Person**: Consider adding more relevant properties, such as:\n    *   `jobTitle`: a string representing the person's job title (e.g., \"CEO\")\n    *   `birthDate`: a date representing the person's birth year\n    *   `education`: an array of strings representing the person's educational background (e.g., [\"Bachelor's Degree in Economics\"])\n*   **Event**: Consider adding more relevant properties, such as:\n    *   `eventType`: a string representing the type of event (e.g., \"Annual General Meeting\")\n    *   `eventDate`: a date representing the event date\n    *   `location`: a location representing the event venue city and country\n\n### 2. Relationship Types and Properties\n\n*   **OWNS**: Consider adding more relevant properties, such as:\n    *   `ownershipPercentage`: a float representing the percentage of ownership (e.g., 0.5)\n    *   `acquisitionDate`: a date representing the acquisition date\n*   **SUBSIDIARY_OF**: Consider adding more relevant properties, such as:\n    *   `subsidiaryName`: a string representing the subsidiary name\n    *   `subsidiaryLocation`: a location representing the subsidiary's location city and country\n\n### 3. Indexes for Better Query Performance\n\n*   Create an index on the `cik` property of the `Company` node to improve query performance when filtering by company CIK.\n*   Create an index on the `name` property of the `Person` node to improve query performance when filtering by person name.\n\n### 4. Data Structure Optimizations\n\n*   Consider creating a separate node for each event type (e.g., \"Annual General Meeting\", \"Board Meeting\") and using the `EVENT_TYPE` property to distinguish between them.\n*   Consider creating a separate node for each location (e.g., city, country) and using the `LOCATION_ID` property to reference these nodes.\n\n### 5. Missing Relationships that Could be Valuable\n\n*   **HAS_EVENT**: This relationship type is already present in the schema. However, consider adding more properties to this relationship type, such as:\n    *   `eventDate`: a date representing the event date\n    *   `location`: a location representing the event venue city and country\n*   **BELONGS_TO_SECTOR**: Consider adding more properties to this relationship type, such as:\n    *   `sectorName`: a string representing the sector name\n    *   `sectorLocation`: a location representing the sector's location city and country\n\nHere is an updated graph schema incorporating these improvements:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Company\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"cik\": String,\n        \"name\": String,\n        \"industry\": String,\n        \"foundingDate\": Date,\n        \"headquarters\": Location\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Person\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"id\": Int,\n        \"jobTitle\": String,\n        \"birthDate\": Date,\n        \"education\": [String]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Event\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"eventType\": String,\n        \"eventDate\": Date,\n        \"location\": Location\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Location\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"city\": String,\n        \"country\": String\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Sector\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": String,\n        \"location\": Location\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"OWNS\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ownershipPercentage\": Float,\n        \"acquisitionDate\": Date\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"SUBSIDIARY_OF\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"subsidiaryName\": String,\n        \"subsidiaryLocation\": Location\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"HAS_EVENT\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"eventDate\": Date,\n        \"location\": Location\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"BELONGS_TO_SECTOR\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"sectorName\": String,\n        \"sectorLocation\": Location\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis updated schema includes additional node types and properties, as well as improved relationship types and properties. It also incorporates data structure optimizations and suggests missing relationships that could be valuable.",
